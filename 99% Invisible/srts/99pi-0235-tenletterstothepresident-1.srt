00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:16,032
When you send a letter to the president it first passes to the office of presidential correspondence

26
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,384
The office was started under President McKinley in 1897

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,944
Twitter receiving about a hundred letters per day

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,552
By the time Herbert Hoover was president that number had gone up to about 800 letter

00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976

Matt president

Barack Obama

34
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:45,216
Dear mr. president dear mr. president mr. President we met 1

35
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,568
You came to my hometown to Tuscaloosa Alabama

36
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
With Canada

37
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
And if you are one of those letter-writers

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
You must

39
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
Imagine

40
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
The odds of the president

41
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
Actually reading your letter

42
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552

And you be right

47
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
Those chances are pretty

48
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,560
People often begin with a reflection on

49
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
I know no one will read this

50
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
I mean that as a really common open

51
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,216
But someone does read your letter or email

52
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,032
And sometimes that person is Fiona Reeves

53
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,848
Director of presidential correspondence at the White House

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,712
We are the office that handles all the incoming correspondence from regular p

55
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,504
Ball to the president in the White House

56
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
So where at

57
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,856
A group of small offices made up of

58
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
45 Stafford

59
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
35 interns

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
In about 300 volunteer

61
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:45,376
Everyday Fiona and the small army of people read through thousands upon thousands of letters addressed

62
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Address to the president

63
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,960
President Obama has requested that 10 letters be

64
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,008
He passed on to him to read every night

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,056
And it's filled his job to decide

66
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
Which town

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
It will be

68
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,456
The president have asked since day one to read 10 letters

69
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
From regular people that

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
What's coming in

71
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
These letters

72
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,392
I think do more to keep me in touch with

73
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
What's happening around the country than just about any

74
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,304
That's a clip from a 2009 video put out by the White House

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,352
Some of them are funny some of the merengue

76
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,656
A lot of them

77
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
Saturn

78
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Frustrated

79
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
About

80
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
Their current situation

81
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,336
Sometimes people reach out about being fired

82
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
When they're down to their last breath

83
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Types of savings

84
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,688
Are there concerns about gun violence

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Climate change

86
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,760
So a lot of

87
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
The stories

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
A heartbreak

89
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
People who work hard

90
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,952
A lot of times I'll say I've never written to a president before

91
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
I'm not looking for a handout

92
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,536
All I want

93
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
Is just a fair Shake

94
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
And

95
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,400
It ends up being a powerful motivator for me

96
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,192
You know it is it is crazy to

97
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
That you are holding my pee

98
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Paper that

99
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,568
What's in a person's hand when they were

100
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,128
Which apps are government is crazy

101
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
The president holds those pieces of paper

102
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,808
Of course these days letters don't always arrive on paper

103
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,904
Fiona and her staff also have to sort through all the emails that come in

104
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,488
Through the White House's Web format whitehouse.gov contact

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Truthettes

106
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,887
Where in email office for the most part but we have a room at that really looks

107
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,191
Like what you think of a snail it's white

108
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Nail in shelves

109
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,311
Topics in a list of what kind of agency is

110
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:33,663
Dental Works in the executive office building located just west of the White House

111
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:38,527
We are scattered throughout this building in whichever rooms happens he available

112
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,647
I can tell you we are tightly packed here we sit very close together

113
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,999
In the staff sitting side-by-side in the office of presidential correspondence

114
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
Securities on an old tradition

115
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,863
I'm opening reading and sorting letters for the present

116
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,423
I would say our paper processing

117
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,591
Cannot be very different than it was a hundred years ago through a screening process

118
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,919
So when the office of presidential correspondence receives them

119
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,223
They've already been opened by Secret Service

120
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
You know checking for anthrax

121
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
Explosives

122
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
Paper letters are clipped to the envelopes they arrived in

123
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
But then it's up to the staff

124
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,439
Can interns and volunteers

125
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
To dig through the letters and emails

126
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
And figure out

127
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
Which ones to pass up the chain

128
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Fiona

129
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
How many do you have to be today

130
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,471
It varies depending on a day but I would say on General de the number that gets rid

131
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
Past me

132
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
Melton Motors

133
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
And you read

134
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
Can you read that many emails and letters

135
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Everyday

136
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Roughly

137
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
Everyday the presidents in town

138
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
He only

139
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
When he's in Washington

140
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,207
Fiona and her team are looking for a range of opinions and styles Express what Americans are thinking about

141
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
Want to give him

142
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:57,631
Now that is representative of geographically we also

143
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,471
But for different writing styles and different levels of writing in Waze

144
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,871
Communicating the office also put some thought into where the president is heading in the coming weeks and what issues he'll be just

145
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
To try to maybe make him better equipped to a Time in Mexico

146
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:23,231
To discuss an issue that maybe he doesn't have a personal perspective on sort of a way of

147
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,535
Giving him more advisors

148
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,863
And the letters don't just inform and influence the president

149
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,727
Fiona make sure the entire White House get the chance to see what people are rioting in about

150
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:39,359
Each day our team does something without the volunteers called a random daily sample

151
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,175
So we'll look at all the email that just came in and put

152
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Together

153
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,039
A list of topics and for imposed and we circulate that list

154
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,367
Throughout the White House trip reprod distribution group

155
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
I guess folks

156
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,231
What the American people are saying that day

157
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,375
They also put together a word cloud that shows the most commonly used terms across all forms of communication

158
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
The biggest word as hell

159
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,519
Because generally when you're reaching out to your government you are looking for help with

160
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,055
Must you

161
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
There are times though

162
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
Like you can see right now the biggest word is gone

163
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
Where there's

164
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,039
Conversation topic

165
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
So in that case

166
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,903
Fiona will make sure the president gets a letter about guns

167
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,463
When we do that we make sure he sees

168
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
Both sides

169
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:32,351
And we think a lot about the order in which things are given to him you know

170
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
How you write something

171
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
I think affects the way it has

172
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:40,031
And after Fiona chooses the 10-letter she hands them off to someone who scans them

173
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
And then hand them to the person who puts together the

174
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Husbands briefing book

175
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
I reach my heat

176
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,711
Text Mom homework binder and

177
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,063
It has information on what he'll be doing the next day

178
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Every night include

179
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,255
I'm like almost everything else that reaches the president these letters have not been fact-checked her committee reviewed

180
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,071
They're some of the most direct communication he receive

181
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,399
When people are writing a memo to the president

182
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
Enough air

183
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
I Ching on a policy topic

184
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:14,847
And everyone who has hand in that or who may have information to Advocate add value

185
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
I take a look at it and ask her

186
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
And so by the time the president

187
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
See that

188
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,015
It has gone through so many eyes

189
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
Our correspondence

190
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,135
Is really like someone sits down at their kitchen table

191
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
Anime

192
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,487
And Anna kissing their mind and then

193
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
That's basically two sets of eyes in the White House

194
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,351
Volunteer if I hate

195
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
Fast and then it's me

196
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
Yeah I agree with that

197
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
And because these letters are so Direct

198
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
An unfiltered

199
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,543
A lot of them are pretty intense

200
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
Empty plate

201
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Personal

202
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Our office

203
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,455
Deals a lot and emotion and empathy because

204
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,527
We are absorbing so much of what people

205
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Hope

206
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,599
Next year and what they're expressing to

207
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,927
Who's the president of the United States but also

208
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,791
Barack Obama in the way they see themselves and Barack Obama and that

209
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
That I think makes our work play

210
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
Quite an emotional one

211
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,215
A lot of people write about where their writing from

212
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
For what time the writing

213
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,335
Now I'm staying up late at night because I can't stop thinking about this

214
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,711
Open that transports you immediately what are they going to say or

215
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,575
From my kitchen window I can see these mountains that we call and I nearly

216
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
Kitchen with them

217
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
We also recently have seen more and more letters

218
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
The begin with something like

219
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,839
I've been meaning to write this for 7 years

220
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
I think

221
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,679
Yeah as the days dwindle down we're getting a lot of

222
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Under The Wire

223
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
Here's what I've been meaning to tell you

224
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
There was one letter

225
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,663
The President yesterday from a man who wrote

226
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
.

227
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
He

228
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Feels like pee

229
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Because

230
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
Present sir

231
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
Pervasive nature of

232
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
Violence in the US

233
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Despite

234
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,743
Being a gay man in the United

235
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,095
I like you would rather live somewhere that

236
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,167
Didn't recognize same-sex marriage on a place where

237
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
He could be discriminated against

238
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
His ankle Darren

239
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
If we just gave out

240
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:26,943
I don't last night so I don't know how that hit him when he read it but when it hit me hit me hard

241
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
Are there any are there any that were there

242
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,575
Bunnies that are that are the kind of the other side

243
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
We got some funny letters one

244
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
Have with me

245
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Is

246
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,023
From a young woman who was

247
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,607
Running for class president of her

248
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Junior class

249
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
And she

250
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
Rodan that

251
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
She wanted some

252
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
Speech writing advice

253
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
President Obama actually responded to that letter

254
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
Is advice

255
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Keep

256
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Speeches

257
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,175
Short and some of them he responds to my hand

258
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
Some of them he writes

259
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
Something like

260
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,831
Neil can you look into this that ass would have to ask someone out on his

261
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
Team to take a look at it

262
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
And on others he writes reply

263
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,231
But then he right sort of

264
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
Crafting items

265
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,095
The White House at the team of writers who elaborate on the president's notes

266
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,375
And turn them into letters

267
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
Which they then hand back

268
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
For the president

269
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Design

270
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,519
And because he's responded personally to so many letters of the year

271
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,591
The writers often have a really good sense of his voice

272
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,455
And often his margin notes are so expensive he's practically responding to the letter himself

273
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
Fun Riders

274
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,647
When the president does engage with the letter whether by replying or by extending it

275
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
Invitation to a White House Event

276
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
Orta highlight

277
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
Specific letter in a public way

278
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
The White House

279
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Usually gets in touch with the author

280
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:53,471
Sometimes Fiona gets to be the one to make that phone call and the truth is we don't always need to make those phone calls

281
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,055
We make them because they're really energizing it's just

282
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,895
So exciting when someone has taken this crazy long shot of

283
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,759
You're writing something to Barack Obama and putting it in the mailbox when you call them

284
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
Sometimes people flip out

285
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,391
I generally make those phone calls

286
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
And I sound

287
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:19,327
More serious than I feel when I make them you know I found your address one in my heart

288
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
Can you believe me

289
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
Fiona's excitement is palpable

290
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,287
She's been a part of this Administration a long time and it's played a huge role in her life

291
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,359
She met her husband while they were sorting Obama's mail

292
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,199
And the job is that a real impact on the White House and the people who work there

293
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
I think its shape

294
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
Houses built the White House

295
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Mercedes I think also

296
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Its shape

297
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
Egg-shaped the humans who work here you know you can't help but think about it when I think about that

298
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
Water bar office

299
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
1 is

300
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
We

301
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
Pretty big team

302
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:58,751
How young people who will go on to do other things and we'll go on

303
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,799
Broader perspective

304
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
And then some

305
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,895
Personal perspective on

306
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
What people who they haven't

307
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
I feel and expect

308
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,367
And Fiona is about to be one of those many people who have passed through the office

309
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
Because her job is ending with the administration

310
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
And what's next for you

311
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
I don't know

312
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
I have no idea

313
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
I think it's a funny place to work

314
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Has

315
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Institution

316
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
For so long

317
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,567
Begin again before 8 years

318
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
I'm so

319
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
And when you are getting ready to leave

320
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
I figured it out or nailing it

321
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,599
The White House is keeping their contact us form open to the last day of the administration

322
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
January 19th

323
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
Even if you write a letter on January 19th

324
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
It can reach Obama

325
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,303
He'll be receiving 10 letters on his last night

326
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,055

Bongs and chatter of our devices

We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

Turn the living room lights on

351
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
Dim the living room lights to 50

Okay

354
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,671
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

355
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,487
Makes for a much more natural experience

356
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
Turn the living room lights on

357
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607

We need to talk about something

366
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,463
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

367
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:04,863
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

368
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:10,495
