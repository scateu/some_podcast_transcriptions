That was exposed to a collection of maps and a proposition that any city is infinite

50
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,416
Because it can be described in infinite ways

51
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440

We forgot about it

63
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
But if I show you the actual map it makes you think this person died here and that one over there you see a pattern ECG
