00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,216
In the spring of 1992

25
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,360
The Baltimore Orioles open their baseball season at a brand-new stadium called Oriole Park at Camden Yards

26
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,408
It's that right along the harbor

27
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
In downtown Baltimore

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
The stadium was small

29
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:38,048
And it's meant it was built with brick and iron trusses a throwback

30
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,864
The classic ballparks from the early 20th century

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,912

59

36
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,272
Camden Yards was really popular right from the store

37
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,368
Here's a TV reporter interviewing a bunch of Orioles fans on opening day

38
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,768
Outstanding outstanding day for baseball outstanding Park and an outstanding year for the oriole

39
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:13,120

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
It's on the Orioles new park

That's pretty Sir Edmund Fitzgerald

47
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,392
Cool sort of a way

48
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,208
All the national attention took the team by surprise

49
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,560
We were just out to build a ballpark that worked for Baltimore this

50
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,096
Football Blue Collar city

00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,960

53
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
Camden Yards

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,056
You know we weren't looking

55
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
To create

56
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,152
Something that would change the Paradigm of baseball parks

57
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,200
But that's exactly what happened

58
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,320
The success of Camden Yards set off a building boom in base

59
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,208
A city after City built new stadiums based on the architectural principles laid down in Baltimore

60
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:15,072
That design Revolution change the experience of going to the ballpark and the relationship

61
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
Between baseball

62
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Insidious

63
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,728
But to understand what made Camden Yards feel so special

64
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
1992

65
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
We need a little bit of hist

66
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,664
In the early 1900s Most baseball stadiums were relatively small

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,712
And built in dense Urban neighbor

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
But in the 1950s and 60s

69
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,344
As white populations flood downtown for the suburbs

70
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
Baseball Fallout

71
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:43,232
Teams built stadiums on the edge of cities where they would be more excessive

72
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,792
To middle-class fans who drove to games

73
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
In cars

74
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,120
They often were acres and Acres

75
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
The parking surrounding

76
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
The stadium

77
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,288
And the stadiums themselves were these massive concrete cylinders

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
Designed house more than one sport

79
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:05,248
From Pittsburgh to Atlanta to Milwaukee everyone had this big round Hawking concur

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
Stadium

81
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,320
It generally house both

82
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
Baseball and football

83
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
But these multi-purpose Stadium

84
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
Square concrete Donuts if they were sometimes called

85
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,280
Really weren't great for fans of either

86
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,119
It's a joke what they became multi-purpose list

87
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,983
They were perfectly round to fit both a football field and a baseball diamond

88
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,079
But that meant that the seats were often really far away from the action or

89
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
Tangled in weird directions

90
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,967
So it ended up being a shape that accommodated everything but

91
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
Serve nothing well

92
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,599
And the multi-purpose stadiums were just way too big

93
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
For baseball

94
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
The old Urban ballpark

95
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
How about 25

96
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
430 thousand

97
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,023
But these had 50000 or more

98
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
Is that 8 interested in work

99
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
You know except for

100
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
A playoff game you simply weren't

101
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
Selling that many tickets

102
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
So the stadiums often felt empty

103
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,823
And critics also complain that they all looked

104
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Exactly the same

105
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
They were

106
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
Not distinctive enough you didn't know if you were in Three Rivers Stadium or you were in Riverfront

107
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
Stadium Bar you were in Veterans Stadium

108
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:17,695
You really didn't know what city you were in her or could be in

109
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
This is Larry luchino

110
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,815
He was the president of the Orioles in the late 80s and early 90s

111
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,143
And during that time the Orioles played in their own concrete

112
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
Free donut Memorial

113
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
What did 1000 Baltimore's football

114
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
The Colts

115
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,847
But in 1984 the Colts abandon the city for Indianapolis

116
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:40,223
A long agonizing frustrating 2 and 1/2 months of waiting and wondering

117
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,039
The Baltimore Colts would be leaving town for good

118
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,343
It has happened to shock is setting in

119
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Emotions

120
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
And the Colts

121
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
Cited the inadequacy

122
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,999
Beijing Memorial Stadium as a reason for leaving

123
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,071
So there was a concern that unless something

124
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,119
Creative was done

125
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
AAA in Baltimore

126
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
For the Orioles

127
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,263
That we might follow the example of the Colts

128
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
And I leave town

129
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
For real

130
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,127
Greater ballparks if you will

131
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
The team's owner

132
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,015
Edward Bennett Williams wanted to build a nice new multi-purpose Stadium

133
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
So that the city could try and Court another football

134
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
Came back to Baltimore

135
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
But Larry luchino had a

136
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
He went to Edward Williams

137
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
And said to him

138
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
Let's look at the most

139
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,095
Successful baseball franchises out there

140
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:34,495
The Yankees in Yankee Stadium the Cubs said Wrigley Field in your Red Sox in in Fenway Park

141
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:41,151
And what did they have in common they all played in a baseball only facility of facility that was the

142
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
Sign for baseball

143
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
And it did not

144
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,551
Compromise architecture late for other sports

145
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,623
Do stadiums actually have another thing in common

146
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
They were really old

147
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Some of the last

148
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,535
Holdouts from the pre-war era of urban ballpark base

149
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,375
And unlike the concrete Donuts the ballparks built back then

150
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
Had all these architectural quora

151
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
Fenway's Green Monster

152
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,543
Wrigley Field iconic brick walls covered in Ivy

153
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,639
They're all a little bit of a different flavor of ice cream

154
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,199
Always thought that something was lost

155
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
When baseball moved

156
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
From those kinds of

157
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Facilities

158
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
2

159
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
Generic multi-purpose

160
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
Stadiums in the 60s

161
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
7 days

162
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,743
Makena wanted to break out of the multi-purpose paradigm

163
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,559
And build a new kind of baseball only Stadium

164
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
One that felt

165
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,935
An old-fashioned traditional baseball park

166
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:40,031
With modern amenities if we use that phrase once we use the

167
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
10000 *

168
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
In fact

169
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,711
Luciano became so zealous in his commitment to building a old-fashioned ballpark

170
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
Betty band Orioles

171
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
Employees from even using the words

172
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:56,927
Stadium indeed we find people $5 if they use the S word Stadium

173
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,999
Instead of referring to our project as a ballpark

174
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,327
Stadium connotes something very different in terms of

175
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:08,447
A size in Monument tality did you collect on those fines

176
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,311
Yeah we did collect a little party and I don't remember how much we got but it wasn't insubstantial

177
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,223
The Orioles struck a deal with the Maryland s word authority to build a new baseball only ballpark in

178
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
Using mostly public money

179
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
City and state government saw it as part of an effort to revitalize downtown

180
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,463
The stadium Authority higher the Architecture Firm hok

181
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,559
And the Orioles brought in their own design director Janet Marie Smith

182
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,119
My assignment was really tough

183
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:43,263
Take those words that he used over and over again of an old-fashioned ballpark with modern amenities

184
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
And try and make certain that we were really being

185
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
True that

186
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
It wasn't an easy task

187
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,479
I no one else had moved into a center city and said

188
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,295
We want to be a part of that tapestry

189
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Bengali Maybe

190
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
70 years

191
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,183
How are we going to create something that feels

192
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
Like it's woven into the

193
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
The city of Baltimore I like it

194
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
It's always belonged

195
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:11,167
Janet Marie Smith turns the ballparks from the early 1900's for inspiration

196
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,983
What made those older ballpark special

197
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,055
Is it they were kind of wedged into a very

198
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
Tight Urban environment

199
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
And by wedged

200
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:24,479
She means that the urban environment actually dictated the shape of the field

201
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,783
Each ballpark had different dimension

202
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,343
Depending on the plot of land on which it

203
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
It was built

204
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
We can only really happen in baseball

205
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,975
With most sports the dimensions of the playing field

206
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
Totally standardized

207
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
But not basic

208
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:42,911
The Roosevelt and feel they've got to be in our you got have 90 feet between the bases 60 feet 6 in

209
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
From home plate to the

210
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,263
Pictures ma'am but there's no rule about the out

211
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,871
And so a lot of the early American ballparks were totally a cement

212
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Ebbets Field built

213
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
In a Brooklyn neighborhood called pigtown

214
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
Had a wildly irregular shape

215
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,111
The left field foul pole was over 50 ft further from home plate

216
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
And the right-field foul

217
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,487
That variety means that some ballparks are better for pictures others are better

218
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
Cheddar's

219
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,839
Some ballparks give up more home runs to right-handed batters others

220
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Lefty's

221
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
So the

222
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
The Park at

223
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Self

224
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Really does shape

225
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
The outcome of the game

226
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
Larry lucchino wanted in a regular playing fee

227
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
Feel like those old-time ballpark

228
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,199
But he felt that the shape needed to respond to the built environment around

229
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:32,319
A site to make sure that just ballpark was integrated into its Sun neighborhood

230
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,415
It didn't feel like I'm flying saucer that descended and just

231
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Landed in the neighborhood

232
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:44,607
The Inner Harbor site where Camden Yards would be built had one distinct architectural feature

233
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
The B&O Warehouse

234
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:50,239
Extremely long brick building built at the turn of the 20th century

235
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
It was abandoned

236
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
At the time end

237
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
A lot of people thought that the Orioles should just tear it down

238
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,919
To give themselves more room to build on

239
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
An opening up of YouTube

240
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,039
The water one sports editor wrote that it was a

241
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,367
An empty rat-infested firetrap

242
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
And it should be done away with

243
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,487
But Janet Marie Smith didn't want to do that

244
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:17,119
We felt strongly that tearing down the very context that might give form

245
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,727
To an asymmetrical playing field and asymmetrical seating Bowl

246
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
Was running

247
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,103
Against the grain of what Larry wanted so they left the warehouse

248
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
We would eventually sit just beyond right field

249
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,223
And design the shape of the playing field around it

250
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
In fact lukino says

251
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:40,671
The decision to preserve the warehouse really dictated nearly every other design decision that went into Canada

252
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
From the shape

253
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
The Stan's

254
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,791
Down to the materials that they used in construction

255
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,887
It gave us a set of brick Motif that we use de in the

256
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Ballpark

257
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,983
And it gave us the iconic symbol

258
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,127
All this small park for Baltimore and it looked a lot like Baltimore and felt a lot like Baltimore

259
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:06,015
If you go to Camden Yards today it's almost hard to tell where the stadium ends and the warehouse begins

260
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
Larry luchino and Janet Marie Smith

261
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
We're both at Camden Yards on Oak

262
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:18,047
I could tell you that we were all anxious she no hair standing on her back like what if it's what it is you know what if it doesn't work

263
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,631
We know any number of things that ran counter

264
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
To the norm

265
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
And

266
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Sports

267
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
Stadium design

268
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,079
That could have gone wrong and any number of things that were normal

269
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,175
That could have just gone wrong he know the toilets not flushing I don't know pick anything

270
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
But nothing went wrong

271
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
Ticket sold out

272
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
Toilets

273
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Blush Dress Barn

274
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,343
And the Orioles did their job on the field

275
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:48,255
Arizona says yes indoors motion Sorrento

276
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,263
Janet and I found each other just as the game ended and embraced each other

277
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,335
Shattuck she said it plays it plays

278
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
There was a

279
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
Big head line across

280
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:11,295
Front page of the Baltimore Sun the day after opening day that said it's a hit

281
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
East Highwood big 2 and 1/2 inch letters

282
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
As if we won the election or something

283
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
All that your people kept coming out to the ballpark

284
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
Park in drugs

285
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,583
When we opened in 1992

286
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
The attendance

287
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,935
Went from something that I like

288
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
2 point

289
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,751
2 or 2.3 million

290
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,799
23.6 million

291
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:39,199
In the second year was 3.7 million in their first two seasons at Camden Yards the Orioles have II

292
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
Highest attendance in the major

293
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,575
And pretty soon other teams started to take notice

294
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
Owners from Texas and from

295
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,951
Cleveland and Colorado

296
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,767
Came to to visit us rather extensively

297
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,631
Then in 1994 another old-fashioned baseball only ballpark

298
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Call Jacobs Field

299
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
Open in downtown Cleveland

300
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
And that was just the beginning

301
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,055
It became impossible

302
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,639
Build a new ballpark and not have it look

303
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
Like an old ballpark

304
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
That's mark lamster

305
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,527
Architecture critic at the Dallas Morning News

306
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,599
Fellow at the Harvard Graduate School of Design

307
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
And that what I like

308
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
We could joke that

309
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Baseball owners

310
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Square

311
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
A bit like

312
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
Teenagers

313
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,095
What the first cool when does then all of a sudden everybody else does

314
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
So if

315
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:34,495
One person has a retro ballpark in its successful in the conventional wisdom becomes

316
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
In order to be successful you have to have

317
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
A retro ballpark

318
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:43,711
In the 25 years since Camden open there have been 20 new stadiums built

319
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,271
And there's not a concrete donut in the butt

320
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,647
And just like Camden Yards most of these new stadiums have been built close to City centers

321
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,927
And all but one of them

322
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
I've been paid

323
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
At least in part

324
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
With public money

325
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,583
Camden Yards the formula right

326
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
This is Neil demause

327
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
A journalist to study Stadium

328
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Hear something

329
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
Supposedly a win-win

330
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,567
The win for the team because they get the fan

331
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
Stadium that they love

332
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,943
And it's a win for the city because they get to revitalize a district

333
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,343
The most Economist agree that if you want to revitalize a neighborhood there are plenty of better ways than building a ballpark

334
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:26,463
Mama says it when a new stadium gets built you'll see some sports bars pop-up nearby

335
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,815
But most businesses can't rely on baseball crowns as a customer base

336
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,375
81 games a year that means there is

337
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,983
You know 280 days a year when there's nothing going on there

338
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
That's an awful lot of

339
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Makeup for

340
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,663
There's also the more fundamental question of whether the Publix

341
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
You have to pay

342
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
4 privately owned building

343
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,527
Mark lamster says It's Tricky

344
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,855
Sports teams occupy this strange space

345
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
They're both businesses

346
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
And public amenities

347
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,487
Sports are really important for cities they help

348
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Create

349
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,583
And identity people love them they bring cities together

350
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Southern

351
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,167
There is some justification for a cities

352
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Supporting

353
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,471
Even a privately owned

354
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
The Leinster says

355
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,871
Most cities have much more urgent spending needs than a new baseball

356
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
Like education

357
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,271
And it's hard to say what level of taxpayer contributions

358
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Is fair

359
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
Especially when

360
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
It's going

361
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
Straight into the pocket

362
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,207
Very very very wealthy individuals

363
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,631
But these difficult questions haven't stopped the Retro ballpark building boom

364
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
Across the country

365
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,007
Baseball teams have done everything they can to follow the Camden template

366
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,311
Write down to iron the same architect

367
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Hok sport

368
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
Distance spun-off into its own independent firm

369
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
Called populist

370
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
It's almost a law

371
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,551
At the new ballpark is by populist

372
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,623
And like Camden most of the new popular Stadium

373
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,415
Yams are small baseball

374
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
Only ballpark

375
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
With comfortable seats

376
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
And fancy food out

377
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,863
And aesthetically they're designed to look like the ballparks from the early 1900's

378
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,447
The palette of Camden Yards has become a cliche

379
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
Ballpark design

380
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
That is

381
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
The Brick

382
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
The

383
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
Green painted iron

384
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
The Green Seed

385
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Some

386
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,223
Typography

387
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
It is all of a piece

388
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,087
It became widely adopted

389
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
All across the country

390
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,207
Each of these new parks had an asymmetrical plane

391
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,583
And like with Baltimore their Dimensions were often determined by the surrounding cities

392
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:46,495
In San Diego is Petco Park the historic Western Metal Supply Company building dictates the length of the left-field line

393
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
Instead of building a fountain

394
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,127
The team just painted a yellow stripe down the corner of the warehouse

395
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,199
AT&T Park in San Francisco is squeezed

396
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
Right up against

397
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
The San Francisco Bay

398
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,063
The right-field line goes all the way to the water

399
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,623
Getting fans a spectacular View

400
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
In creating a unique

401
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
Local drama

402
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
Splashdown home runs

403
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
When someone hit the ball into the bay

404
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,351
A flotilla of kayakers to send on the souvenir

405
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:18,239
But not all the new retro ballparks were so successfully integrated with the urban landscape

406
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
Take Citi Field

407
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
New Mets stadium in Queens

408
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,871
It has an asymmetrical shape

409
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,919
But not because it's wedged

410
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
Into a tight Urban lot

411
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,759
It's actually set out in the same place that

412
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
Predecessor Shea Stadium was

413
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,647
In the middle of a parking lot and it has all these idiosyncratic dimensions

414
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
No reason

415
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,023
Before it's an idiosyncrasy is not driven by any

416
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
A particular

417
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
Constraint

418
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
Of the area around

419
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Entirely

420
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
Artificial

421
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
When you're at sea

422
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:52,031
Citi Field Mark lamster says you can feel how hard the Architects work

423
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
To manufacture a sensor

424
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
History inauthenticity

425
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
He says that

426
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
Everyone in the league has been so focused on building these old-fashioned idiosyncratic ballparks like Camden

427
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:07,391
That they've actually created a new architectural orthodox

428
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
They all have exact

429
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,719
The same DNA they're all designed by

430
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,023
By the same firm they all kind of look the same

431
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,375
Except the whole idea is that each one is idiosyncratic and individual

432
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
It sits at the tall tale

433
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,031
Despite is 40

434
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:29,407
Mark lamster says there's no denying the post Camden ballparks are better places

435
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
To watch baseball

436
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
Any old concrete

437
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:36,063
Even Citi Field in New York the stadium lamp Syracuse

438
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
Trying a little too hard

439
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,671
It's still way nicer than its predecessor Shea Stadium

440
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,719
Can you describe Shea Stadium I mean

441
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,047
Can I describe Shea Stadium yes I can describe Shea Stadium

442
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
Think of a toilet

443
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
Put seats in it

444
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
That's a stadium

445
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,471
It wasn't a nice place to watch a game no

446
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,031
Is the new place a nice place to watch the game

447
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,103
Absolutely it's a much much nicer place to watch

448
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
Watch the game at the really great

449
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
To watch a game

450
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,735
And being a nice place to watch a game is

451
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
Important for

452
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
In recent decades

453
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,623
Sports television ratings have started to slide

454
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
But attendance numbers are strong

455
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
Kennedy's ballpark

456
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:19,071
Are part of the reason why cuz they're fun places to go people enjoy sitting there

457
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Watching the game

458
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:30,079
And for me enjoying the game has always had a bit of nostalgia to it

459
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,639
I don't even follow baseball bat closely

460
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,223
But I'll go eat a hotdog and listen to the organ music

461
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Because

462
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
Feels like a fun tradition

463
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,575
More than any other sport

464
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
Baseball is about its own path

465
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
And plays to its

466
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
Nostalgic

467
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
History

468
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,327
That obsession with history drove the Retro ballpark Revolution

469
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
But as an architecture

470
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,215
Mark lamster is ready for some team out there to embrace the future

471
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
Why were we looking back

472
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
Nostalgic Lee when we designed

473
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
Baseball parks instead of

474
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,639
Looking towards new materials in new ways

475
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
The building in Newark

476
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,759
Annie's Camden Yards has taught us anything

477
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,111
It's that when someone does come up with a great new way of building a ballpark

478
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
Every team in the league

479
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,696
Is going to want one

480
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Of Their Own

481
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:31,264
99percentinvisible was pretty so sweet by Emmett Fitzgerald what's a production in mix by Syracuse

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

509

The cluttered World a man-made sound

510

If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

Voice technology talk to us

513
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744

To make them more human

517
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
Turn the living room lights on

518
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Okay

519
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
Dim the living room lights

520

50%

521
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
Okay

522
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,832
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

523
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,648
Makes for a much more natural experience

524
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,696
Turn the living room lights on

525
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280

Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

536
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,024
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

537
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,656
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

Comic mystery

570
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,656
That whines through a

571
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,704
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

We're looking the part

573

Might cost you your life

574
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:01,152
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

575
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:05,504
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

576
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,832
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

577
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
A dad

578
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,208
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

579
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:18,560
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

580
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,984
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

581
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,312
Was found dead in my private gym

582
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,640
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

583
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
Even worse

584
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,992
The cops think that I had something to do with it

585
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,272
Now

586
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,320
I need to clear my name

587
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:46,720
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

588
