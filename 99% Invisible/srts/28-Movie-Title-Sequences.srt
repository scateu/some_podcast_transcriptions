It's still there isn't

Has a title designer

57
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
Very important that the music that you use in a sequence is something that you love that you really enjoy working with because it can be

Title design

65
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,896
Inside is awesome it's a completely different

66
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,688
Set of people that

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
Do the work that do titles

68
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,784
People don't always realize that

69
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,368
And I always seem to be always surprised that I was some actually thought about this

70
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,440
Paid to design into work on Sunday

71
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,488
Yeso

72
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
Connected to the

73
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:50,400
Fundamentally a title sequence is a presentation of a legal document to the audience

74
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
A list of names of the crew and actors in everything who are associated with a film and then there's be more interesting in

75
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
An artistic reason

76
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
But I don't seek

77
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:03,712
Establishing tone and perhaps a storyline but there are rules what you're doing in studio film

78
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,808
The designer or the company will gets a

79
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
A document that's

80
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,952
You know maybe 10 to 15 pages long if you just read out the text

81
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:19,071
The title sequence easily on a single page but of course it says 15 page document

82
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
And besides title

83
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
There is several paragraphs

84
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
Text about how each title needs to be

85
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,055
Be treated like maybe in some sequences the lead to actors require their names

86
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
Bigger than the other titles

87
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
And they'll actually list in the

88
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,479
Exact percentage size that it needs to be bigger than the other titles in the sink

89
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:42,367
Set very specific and it's in as a designer it gets very frustrating and challenging to deal with this because

90
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
It feels very limiting

91
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:49,023
To need to have every single title in the sequence be exactly the same size

92
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:55,167
When it comes to Innovation and influence and title design there are two words you need to know

93
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Saw

94
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Bass

95
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,823
He was a major Benchmark in terms of realizing that you could have good design in a title 6

96
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
Saul Bass

97
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
Came along

98
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:09,759
It was a designer that started to work on more promotion for films and then started to

99
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
Bring his illustration and Design

100
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Style

101
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
2 oz

102
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
Ethicon number

103
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,231
Pieces if the title sequences of Saul bathroom immediately

104
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,535
Spring to mind do yourself a favor and Google

105
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
Anatomy of murder

106
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,375
The man with the golden arm or psycho or

107
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
Vertigo

108
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,703
So good what I love about

109
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
Some of his earlier title

110
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,079
Princesses if you look at them they're basically animated film post

111
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,943
But a lot of that solve a style faded away in the 80s you know the 80s

112
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
And the 90s

113
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,783
He started to get The Branding idea with films

114
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
And so a lot of

115
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
Title sequences

116
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,671
Once a much title sequences but we're just over the logo the song

117
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
You're creating a brand

118
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
Back to the Future

119
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,327
Where's it's a very iconic logo design and you have a lot of that

120
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,143
I late 80s and early 90s

121
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
You didn't see as many

122
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,007
Complete opening title sequences

123
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,567
Beetham stand-alone or servants good with the song

124
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
Which is not done very much

125
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
These days

126
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,455
Nuts have been a lot of films where there's just a big

127
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Logo that you see on the

128
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,063
But then we hit the second major

129
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,463
The movie Seth its titles were created by Kyle Cooper instead of reintroduced the idea that

130
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
The title sequence could be its own thing

131
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
What is what

132
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
Bastard

133
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
Yunnan decades earlier

134
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:34,239
The title sequence of 7 works as both a standalone vignette and is a vital introduction to the grimy and obsessive

135
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
CEO of the movie

136
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,871
Serial killer in 7 doesn't appear until two-thirds of the way into the film

137
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,223
You really get to know the killer right here in the first 2 minutes

138
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,527
How Cooper took us inside his head

139
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
The most memorable

140
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,135
Title sequences are really ones were

141
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,719
You know there's a great movie after if 7 was put in front of some

142
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
You know terrible movie that no one saw it wouldn't have moved on to influence generation of title designers

143
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
One of the in Albertsons favorite titles

144
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
Sequences is another couch

145
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Cooper creation

146
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
The island of dr. Moreau

147
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Who's the one that

148
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,175
Check the in in the head and made him start noticing titles in the first place

149
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
But if you were smart

150
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
You probably didn't see

151
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,551
The island of dr. Moreau

152
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
And you don't know how cool the titles

153
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,951
But every human on earth over the age of 20

154
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,511
Knows the name of Gerrit Smith's favorite titles

155
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,887
The TV title sequence for cheers I can watch that

156
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
Endlessly

157
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,519
I remember liking it before I was a designer had anything to do with design so

158
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:44,383
I was trying to put my finger on why I like it and of course the great theme song on

159
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
Makes a big difference

160
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,991
But it also just has lovely typography very simple

161
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
Lovely typography and

162
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
The

163
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,463
Editing of the sequences fantastic is it just captures the entire tone of the television show and in 30 seconds to

164
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,047
Tears is a montage of historical drawings and photographs

165
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,839
People enjoying themselves

166
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
In bars

167
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
And what they do

168
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,703
Underneath eats of the title cards for the ACT

169
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,031
I actually find Historical image that does sort of

170
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,591
Suggest that character in the television series

171
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
The reason I enjoy it is warm

172
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
And friendship

173
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,479
And that really comes across I think of that title

174
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:31,231
There are a lot of fans of film title design out there was trying to figure out why that is and I feel like film title design more than

175
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
Other sorts of

176
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
Design has a bit of a longevity

177
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Because it is committed to film

178
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
Is it a lot of design

179
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Is

180
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,239
Commercial or Prince and it kind of

181
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,335
