I'm Roman Mars

31
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,904
In 1979

32
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,488
The Los Angeles Dodgers signed and unknown picture from Mexico

33
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,376
Named Fernando Valenzuela

34
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,960
A couple years later 1981

35
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,288
Valenzuela made his major league debut as a starting pitcher

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,592
That's producer and Angelina

37
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
Vivien Leigh

38
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,480
Valenzuela went on to have one of the most remarkable seasons in the history of baseball

39
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,040
This obscure player from Sonora Mexico

40
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,368
Became the first player ever to win both the Cy Young Award

41
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,416
Rookie of the Year in the same season

42
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,744
Valenzuela live the Dodgers all the way to the World Series

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
When he defeated the New York Yankees

44
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:14,656
Fernando Valenzuela 249 pitcher tonight

45
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,312
The season will always be remembered in Los Angeles as the year of Fernando Mania

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,872
The whole city fell in love with Valenzuela

47
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,456
Any particular always large Mexican-American community

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,016
We actually had someone

49
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,832
A real true Mexicana playing baseball

50
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
No major league team

51
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,208
This is Edward Sunday on La native and longtime Dodgers

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
And it was in Los Angeles and Eugene as you know

53
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
The LA is is

54
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,424
Is so big and it's full of Latinos were all struggling to Jamaican in this

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
This world end

56
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,264
He actually made it and he made everybody proud

57
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,896
Edward says it was nothing quite like watching a game at Dodger Stadium when Valenzuela with pitch

58
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
We would take younger kids that couldn't afford

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,320
To go to the Dodger game with me I'll get tickets and and take them and and

60
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,368
Haven't experienced the

61
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:11,744
The cheering and that you know fernandomania and Venezuela and cheering and training

62
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,328
Screaming for him so it was it was a good time it was fun

63
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,192
But not everybody in Edwards family wanted to go see Fernando's famous

64
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Screwball and act

65
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,568
How many older folks especially were hesitant to make the Trek to Dodger Stadium

66
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
It was just

67
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,432
The younger generation that would would go with us

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,552
I don't know there was still a little bit of animosity towards the Dodgers for for what happened

69
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
What transpired up at Chavez Ravine

70
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,000
Chavez Ravine was a neighborhood where Edwards father Lewis grow up

71
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,072
I didn't used to sit exactly where Dodger stadium is

72
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Today

73
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,632
Back in the 1950s

74
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
The community at Chavez Ravine with

75
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,264
It's placed in a contentious battle to reshape what the city would look like

76
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
Because back then

77
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
Los Angeles wasn't known as the

78
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
Sprawling World Center it is today

79
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
Here since the turn of the century

80
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,784
Has grown from a sleepy Pueblo

81
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
Seething Metropolitan City

82
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
It's an up-and-coming City

83
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
But it is not

84
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
Really

85
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Sweetly there yet

86
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
This is Gerald poder author of the book

87
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
City of Dreams

88
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,399
Dodger Stadium and the birth of modern Los and

89
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
In the early 20th century

90
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,775
The population of Los Angeles with exploding

91
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
People are moving to California

92
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Climate

93
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
The jobs in the cheap real estate

94
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
It was a city on the rise

95
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
Something was missing

96
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
When Americans were asked

97
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
Talk about the major cities of the

98
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
Look up the country

99
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
In the 19th

100
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
Obviously they would say New York

101
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Are they would say

102
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,279
They might even say Detroit

103
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,631
But they might not say Los Angeles and they might even be amazed to know

104
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
How big is City

105
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:01,567
La didn't have the rose of towering skyscrapers that made New York and Chicago unmistakable

106
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
It was missing something else too

107
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
Something that was hard to put a finger on

108
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,271
Los Angeles felt more like a collection of neighborhoods than a cohesive City

109
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,831
If you ask me and do we know where they were from

110
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
What is insane

111
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
Los Angeles

112
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
They might say Boyle Heights

113
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
Highland Park

114
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
If they have any kind of

115
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
Civic identity

116
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,815
It's tied to their neighborhood and not know

117
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
Necessarily

118
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
Tudor City

119
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,215
So there are very very few pieces of what I call citic glue

120
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
In Los Angeles

121
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
In the 1950s

122
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
Very few Municipal Institute

123
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Oceans

124
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,175
That's everyone in the city can identify with

125
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
And rally around

126
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:44,575
In a few city leaders thought if the people of Los Angeles needed something to Rally around

127
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Let's give them

128
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
Baseball team

129
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
From its Inception

130
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
Professional baseball in the US

131
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
Play mostly on the East Coast

132
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,655
By 1953 only a couple of teams have ventured west of the Mississippi River

133
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
Cardinals

134
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
The Browns

135
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,287
But they only made it as far as St Louis which is actually on the Mississippi so barely count

136
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,871
But Los Angeles with a west coast city on the Rhine

137
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,199
And was looking for a way to boost its reputation

138
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
And how do you get the reputation will you get the reputation with big splashy acquisitions

139
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,183
Like a major league baseball team when there is no major

140
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Elite baseball

141
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
On the West Coast

142
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,095
And so la city leaders began plotting to Laura baseball team out west

143
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,399
One woman named Rosalind Wyman

144
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:34,751
Even campaign for City Council on the promise to bring a major league team to Los Angeles

145
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
It worked

146
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,079
Choose electricity Council it just

147
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
22 years old

148
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:44,223
And as luck would have it for a Roz Wyman and other angelinos desperate for baseball

149
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,807
There's an East Coast team in desperate need of a new stadium

150
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
The Brooklyn Dodgers

151
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,439
They were a classic baseball team who have been playing at a classic ballpark

152
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
Call David's field

153
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,815
Any state is New Yorkers love to get nostalgic about Queen little Ebbets Field

154
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
Right in the heart of Brooklyn

155
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:04,447
But those who are nostalgic about seeing game at

156
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,287
Pittsfield probably never actually were there

157
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,103
Abbottsfield had a lot of problems

158
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,663
There were columns obstructing the view of the field

159
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,063
Steep climbs the upper deck barely any parking or freeway access and the building itself was falling apart

160
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:26,719
The team owner Walter O'Malley wanted to build his own modern well-designed stadium in Brooklyn

161
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:33,375
He even went so far as to hire Buckminster Fuller to Draft plans for a dome to go over the top of the field that would turn

162
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,679
On the stadium into an all-weather facility

163
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:41,567
You don't usually think of baseball team owners as being friends with that with futurist Architects but

164
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
In this case that was

165
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,383
Then that that was what was going on

166
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,759
O'Malley fought for years for his dream of a privately owned Stadium

167
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,855
But there was one very powerful bureaucrats standing in the way

168
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
New York Symphony

169
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Master builder

170
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
Robert Moses

171
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,535
It just so happened that Robert Moses

172
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
Not only didn't like spectator

173
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,399
Sports he thought that spectator sports warraich

174
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Total

175
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,191
Waste of time

176
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
And for what he called LaRue

177
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
And without Moses's

178
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
Support

179
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
A new Dodger Stadium in Brooklyn

180
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
Basically

181
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
Impossible

182
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,247
And O'Malley said well one I'm a brooklynite and I want the

183
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,367
The park to be in Brooklyn if it's in Queens it might as well be ten thousand miles away

184
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,951
O'Malley figured if he couldn't get his dream stadium in Brooklyn

185
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
He might as well move the daughter is all the way out

186
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
The California

187
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,887
Roz Wyman in the city council

188
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
Invited O'Malley out to Los Angeles

189
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,799
He had by my estimation and spent a total of

190
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
10 days

191
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
In his entire life

192
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
In Los Angeles

193
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,223
He doesn't really know where he wants to build a deal

194
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,551
Yet to come to Los Angeles but he's scouting it out

195
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:00,927
Decided to take a helicopter ride across the city to get a feel for the area

196
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,231
And he saw something that caught his eye

197
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,791
What look like an empty piece of land

198
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,095
Just a few miles from downtown

199
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,911
This hilly area was called Chavez Ravine

200
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:16,031
The thing that he sees is all the vacant land around Chavez Ravine

201
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
But it was surrounded by the freeways

202
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
This is Mark's Landing

203
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
The official historian for the LA Dodgers

204
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,015
He says that the freeways made the side of healing because it meant that fans would have

205
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
Easy access to the stadium

206
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
The train was really hilly

207
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,159
And we would need to do a huge amount of work

208
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Flatten out the land

209
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,743
It was all worth it because of the highway Acts

210
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
He even estimated the amount of

211
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,839
Land that would have to be moved

212
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:46,239
That didn't bother him because it's easy to move that land but it's hard to build three or four different freeways

213
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,103
Broomelli probably didn't realize that the plot of land that he had his eye on

214
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
Wasn't completely empty

215
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,223
There were a few families living in Chavez Ravine

216
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,063
I've been there a long time and if the Dodgers were going to build a stadium there

217
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
They'd have to kick those people out

218
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
And it wouldn't be the first time

219
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,951
But the people of Chavez Ravine

220
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
Have been forced

221
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
To leave their home

222
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,559
O'Malley thought he saw a vast

223
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
Empty stretch of land from the helicopter

224
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:19,519
But what he was really saying we're the last legs of a community that had existed there since the early 1900s

225
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
In for a long time

226
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
It was a neighborhood full of life

227
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
It was very colorful

228
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
Because the ladies

229
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Had

230
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
Colorful birds

231
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
Canaries were big I mean

232
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,367
Atwood wake us up canaries in the morning singing

233
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,183
And it was just a very colorful

234
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
Community

235
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
This is Carol Hawkins

236
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
Yes my name is Carol Hawkins

237
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
And it's spelled

238
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,143
Jacquees

239
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,239
Carol is 76 years old now and still lives in Los Angeles

240
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
And as a little girl she grew up in Chavez Ravine

241
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,383
I know you said you're pretty young when you left

242
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:01,247
I'm so as much as you can remember I'm out so I can remember a lot

243
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Okay

244
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,135
Carol was only nine or ten years old when her family left Chavez Ravine

245
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,439
But our memories are crystal clear

246
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
I was very rude

247
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,023
So we could always see the trees

248
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,607
And at that time when I was growing up anyway

249
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
At this time of year there always be like

250
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
When you woke up

251
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,543
Chavez Ravine with like a small town within the city

252
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,871
It was home to mostly Mexican and Mexican-American families

253
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
Was made up of three different neighborhoods called

254
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
Palo Verde

255
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
Paloma in Bishop

256
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,295
Some roads were paved but most boring

257
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,111
Water pump at electricity but some didn't

258
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,463
In its own way though it was still a flourishing closely knit community

259
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,559
We're like any other neighborhood we had some people that we're doing very well

260
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,607
There was some families that were very

261
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Or

262
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
There was some families that were not so nice

263
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,239
There was some families that were very religious

264
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
But they were all still

265
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
Friends and everybody knew each other

266
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,663
Chavez Ravine was located just a few miles

267
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
Bus from downtown Los Angeles

268
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
But it felt like

269
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
A world apart

270
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,807
It was this isolated pocket

271
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Within the city

272
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
It has its own schools

273
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
Churches stores

274
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
Barber shop

275
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,511
The residents had everything they needed without ever having to leave the neighborhood

276
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,351
But a lot of the reason why they were so independent

277
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
Or because they had to be

278
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
60% of the

279
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
People

280
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,567
Mexican Mexican American people that were living in Chavez Ravine area

281
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
On their own home

282
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
And the reason is

283
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,967
Because that was the only place in the city we could live

284
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
Because of the Covenants

285
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
Covenants were racial restrictions

286
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,135
That limited where people of color could actually purchase property

287
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
From the 1910s through the 1940s

288
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,279
Chavez Ravine with one of the few places in Los Angeles

289
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,095
That non-white people could actually own a home

290
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,191
First threat to the community was not actually the baseball stadium

291
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,983
18 years before

292
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
In the form of a new housing project

293
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
1949

294
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,639
The federal government passed the National Housing Act

295
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:10,271
Which allocated funds to cities all over the country in order to build new low income housing for

296
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
People in need

297
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
Los Angeles itself

298
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,647
We're going to be home to 10,000 of these new public housing units

299
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
This was part of an effort to alleviate a severe housing shortage that ensued during the early

300
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,607
Early 1940s during World War II

301
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:29,215
And public housing was seen as a solution to providing

302
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Affordable

303
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:36,383
Sanitary living conditions for poor people who were not able to provide that for them

304
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Sounds

305
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
This is Eric Avila

306
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,015
Professor of history and Chicano studies at UCLA

307
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:47,135
He says that the city selected Chavez Ravine to be the site for 3600 new units

308
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
It's because

309
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,463
City Housing Authority or chaa

310
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
Determined it was

311
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Slum

312
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,583
Caj claim that it was infested with rats

313
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,679
Homes like electricity and toilets and it was actually in their best interest

314
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
At the community be replaced

315
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
With new modern house

316
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
From an urban planning perspective

317
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,151
Or from the perspective of City Hall

318
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,223
For Community like the Choppers are being

319
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,783
Fit their idea of what

320
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Islam was

321
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,927
The time but if you talk to the people who remembered what it was like to live in the troposphere

322
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
They didn't think of their neighborhood as

323
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Aslam

324
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
We have flushing toilet

325
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
Everywhere that I went

326
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,911
And I went to a lot of houses and when I had to go to the bathroom

327
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
We had flushing toilets

328
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,775
We had some lights not a lot

329
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Because

330
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
We can still see all the stars at night

331
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
Without any problem whatsoever

332
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
We had a lot of things

333
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
That would not Marcus

334
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
As slums

335
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,831
But because Chavez Ravine was officially designated a slum

336
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,951
City Housing Authority was able to use eminent domain to clear the land for the housing project

337
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,791
Property-owning residents were offered payment for their homes

338
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
Which was Far Below market value

339
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,167
And it's debatable whether you could even call it an offer

340
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,983
Carol remembers when a man named Frank Wilkinson

341
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,775
Who was in charge of the housing project

342
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Keep the house

343
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,615
I remember when the actual knock on the door came

344
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Anda

345
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,967
He wasn't that congenial he wasn't really that nice

346
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
But

347
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Who is it Italian

348
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
He was there to tell us

349
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
That we have no choice

350
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
That was made

351
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Very clear

352
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
That there was no choice

353
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
But we all had to move

354
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,703
Almost everyone in Chavez Ravine ended up selling their homes and then moving to different parts of the city

355
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:43,359
By 1948 the restrictive covenants that prevented families of color from moving into other areas were ruled unconstitutional

356
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Nutritional

357
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:49,759
A lot of these former residents became the first Mexican and Mexican-American families in these new neighborhood

358
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
We moved into what was it

359
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,599
Completely white community at the time

360
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,415
But what was going on for me when I move there there was a lot of white

361
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,535
Having people like me leaving because of people like me coming in

362
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:12,287
Some residents were told that they would be first in line to move into the new public housing community at Chavez Ravine

363
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
But those hopes

364
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
Short-lived

365
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,967
In 1953 a new Los Angeles mayor named North Pole Santa office

366
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,527
Ideological objection to the

367
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
Chi Brandon

368
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,903
Public housing as a communist plot

369
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
Or socialist conspiracy

370
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,815
Wholesome thought that subsidized housing for the poor it sounded like Tommy not sent

371
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,655
And he made sure that the housing project was dead in the water

372
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,239
The people of Chavez Ravine have been displaced

373
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
For no reason

374
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,615
Except for a small number of people who refused to leave their homes

375
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,687
The community of Chavez Ravine was basically gone

376
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,343
We would go there you know it's like oh look there's this house or this or that all they took all the flowers out of this year

377
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,159
We'll just go back and visit but it was a ghost

378
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Discount

379
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
Except for a handful of people

380
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:07,583
All the stores were gone the church was gone they knocked down the school

381
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:11,167
The city ended up buying land from the federal Housing Authority

382
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
I left it undeveloped

383
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:16,031
For years while it figured out how to put the property to public use

384
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
And that's where the Dodgers come back into the

385
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,639
Walter O'Malley was convinced

386
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,943
Chavez Ravine was the perfect place

387
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
To build his perfect Stadium

388
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,551
The first it looks like it might be smooth sailing

389
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,623
The city council approved the deal to give the land

390
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
To the Dodgers

391
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
But as it turned out

392
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:38,303
A lot of people were opposed to the Dodger deal for reasons that had nothing to do with Chavez Ravine

393
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,375
I didn't want the city subsidizing a private business

394
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
Even if that business was baseball

395
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Fact

396
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,495
The opposition was so intense

397
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,567
City decided to put the deal up for a referendum

398
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
This meant that the following year

399
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
Contract would be placed on the ballot

400
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,247
And the citizens of La would get the chance to vote on the new stadium

401
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
And in the end

402
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,087
Voters did come out in the Dodgers favor

403
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Barely

404
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,279
But they were still the issue of the handful of remaining holdouts live in in Chavez Ravine

405
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,607
Even though the federal Housing Authority had tried to clear the land

406
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,911
There were a small number of families

407
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
Refuse to give up their home

408
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,495
Those who remain

409
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
Being so in protest

410
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
They're only about

411
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,015
20 families left after the federal Housing Authority tried to clear the land

412
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,575
And they needed to be evicted in order to start

413
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Construction

414
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,183
These residents had watched their Community disappear around them

415
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,231
All the city referred to them as squatters

416
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,047
That was their land that was their property

417
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,863
I guess you could say that they were squatting

418
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,911
But from their perspective

419
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
They are on that land

420
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
For 4

421
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Several Generations

422
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
That's not squatting

423
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
On May 9th

424
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
1959

425
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,663
Time has run out

426
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
The city of Los Angeles

427
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:04,063
Send Sheriff's deputy used to Chavez Ravine to remove anyone who had refused to leave

428
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,599
What followed

429
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,927
Was a horrific scene of a family called the arteaga's

430
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
Being dragged out of their house

431
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,279
Their daughter a woman named Aurora Vargas

432
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,607
Was physically lifted and carried out of the doorway

433
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Broen home

434
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,703
This was captured on camera by reporters

435
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,007
We couldn't find any audio recording

436
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
But it was broadcast all over the country

437
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,383
There are these scenes that are

438
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,943
Indelibly impressed

439
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,807
Into the living memory of Los Angeles

440
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Of

441
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,159
You know a mother and her children being forcefully

442
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
Evicted from their homes

443
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
I'm a grandmother being

444
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,071
Got carried out in her rocking chair from

445
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:53,471
The home dogs barking chickens flying everywhere children crying it was a complete melee

446
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
When I saw

447
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
Aurora Vargas

448
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
Intellivision

449
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
Being

450
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,431
Forcibly taken out of her house

451
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
I saw the house

452
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,503
Being knocked down

453
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
That was

454
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,087
Really that was the point where I hated the Dodge

455
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,135
Because in my head

456
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
That's all I could see

457
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
Is is

458
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
This wonderful

459
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,071
Kind of Nirvana place that I grew up in

460
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
I was sad to have left that

461
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
Of course

462
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
But

463
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
I saw them

464
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,239
Knocking down

465
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
And doing what they did on

466
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,079
Live on TV

467
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
I think I was

468
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,687
Can a 15 psi under but it was pretty traumatic for

469
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
For me

470
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,599
Evictions dredged up memories not just of a failed housing project years earlier

471
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,927
What if an entire history of racial discrimination that

472
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:49,791
Latino and Chicano Americans have been experiencing in Los Angeles for decades

473
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,607
And if you know anything about Mexican American history

474
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,911
It is a history of Conquest

475
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
It is a history of displacement

476
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
And it is a history most of all

477
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
Loveland

478
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Dispossession

479
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
So this team

480
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,919
Really hit a nerve with a community

481
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
That had a long

482
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Suffered

483
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,319
The indignity the pain the inconvenience

484
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
Displacement and Landis

485
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
It just hit

486
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,560
What happened at Chavez Ravine will always be part of the team's Legacy

487
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,120
But it wouldn't be fair to blame all that

488
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
On the Dodgers

489
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,680
The Dodgers

490
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
God blamed for this

491
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,752
Although it wasn't the Dodgers

492
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Koovs

493
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
Remove these families at

494
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
City Who removed

495
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
These families

496
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,944
I think it is unfair to say that

497
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
The Dodgers remove these

498
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
These families

499
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,064
The the chain of events is a little different

500
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,624
This history is complicated

501
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:52,512
It's hard to sum of all the forces and events that led to the destruction of job as ravine

502
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,072
But the stadium has become a monument

503
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,144
Physical reminder of the community that was the

504
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
Displaced from the land

505
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,704
On which it sits

506
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:05,568
Today Dodger stadium is the third oldest ballpark in baseball

507
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
And you have to admit

508
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
It's a beautiful Stadium

509
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:13,760
It's symmetrical with elegant lines amazing views of the city

510
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
And somehow

511
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
Even a bad seat

512
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,344
Still a pretty good seats

513
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:22,720
In some ways the ballpark did exactly what those politicians back in the 1950s wanted it to do

514
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,280
The Dodgers are a Civic Institution

515
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,840
Beloved by people throughout the city

516
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:33,728
The Dodgers are even known for having one of the most diverse fan bases in Baseball thanks in large part

517
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
To La's Latino community

518
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:42,176
I would have to say that that LA's Mexican-American Community is of two minds on this issue

519
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:48,064
I I think many mexican-americans see the Chavez Ravine as part of a larger story

520
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,624
Of discrimination

521
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,208
Displacement in Southern California

522
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:59,840
On the other hand Mexican Americans are among the Dodgers biggest

523
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,008
And that was especially true in the early 1980s with the arrival of Fernando Valenzuela

524
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
And Fernando Mania

525
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,848
Isn't the only reason why

526
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:16,224
The Dodgers have tried to appeal to the LA Latino Community from the very beginning with

527
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,576
Broadcasters like Jaime hurrying who's been calling games for the team in Spanish

528
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:26,976
Almost as long as the Dodgers have been in LA

529
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,400
Edward Satie on spotter Lewis

530
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,728
Was one of the many who refused to see games at Dodger Stadium

531
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,056
He didn't blame the team for what happened to his community

532
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,128
But the stadium would always be reminder of

533
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
The home he used to have

534
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
His claim to fame

535
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,760
Is that he was born where third base is at

536
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,576
And his umbilical cord back then

537
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
Would be buried wherever

538
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,184
You know you were born so he claims that their base

539
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:01,536
That every time somebody hits a triple or a homerun

540
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
He would get a pain in his stomach

541
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,144
Because that's where his umbilical cord is very that

542
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
On the 3rd Saturday of July

543
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,128
Former residents of Chavez Ravine get together for an annual reunions picnic in Elysian Park

544
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
Edward's father Louis

545
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,736
Started the tradition years ago and named the group

546
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,296
Los Desperados meaning be uprooted

547
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
And they don't get together out of anger

548
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,648
They're not there to protest the Dodgers

549
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
It's just a bunch of friends

550
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
Family

551
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
Want to tell stories

552
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,792
And celebrate the neighborhood

553
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
But they shared beneath the ballpark

554
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
What the hell is a Dodger anyway

555
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
Vivian will be back to tell us

556
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Between the beats

557
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,352
Bongs and Charter of our devices

558
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
We're immersed

559
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,680
The cluttered World a man-made sound

560
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
If

561
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,312
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

562
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:23,200
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room in a kid is in another room and we're all hearing. Voice

563
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
Technology

564
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
You talk to us

565
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,296
It is a creation of Sonic trash

566
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,368
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

567
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,952
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

568
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,744
To make them more human

569
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Turn the living room lights on

570
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Okay

571
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,168
Dim the living room lights

572
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
50%

573
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
Okay

574
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,384
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

575
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,688
Makes for a much more natural

576
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
Experience

577
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
Turn the living room lights on

578
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,344
Dim the living room lights to 50%

579
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:10,048
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

580
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,840
Landscape is impacting our health

581
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,400
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

582
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,216
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

583
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Right here

584
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
NPI fate

585
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,128
So I'm back in the studio with Vivien Leigh

586
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,920
And we can talk a little bit more about the Dodgers

587
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,224
And mainly where the name the Dodgers

588
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
Comes from

589
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:33,344
So this is kinda embarrassing I am from Southern California

590
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,904
I moved here from La so the Dodgers

591
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,696
Have essentially been mighty

592
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,488
My entire life

593
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:43,072
And I didn't realize until I started working on this story

594
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
But I had no idea

595
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
What the hell is a Dodger

596
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:54,848
But you've never wondered or you've never been told I've never thought about it and I never realized it.

597
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,408
As an action and so I just

598
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:02,016
I guess I didn't really think of it either so what is a Dodger and what it what exactly are they dodging

599
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,808
The name actually comes

600
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,672
From where the team originally started out which is Brooklyn where they were known as the Brooklyn

601
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
Trolley Dodgers

602
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,256
Used to have a lot of

603
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:18,656
Trolleys that we're on the street and you had to.

604
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:22,496
Buy a few nicknames for this they officially started as the Atlantic

605
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,568
And then they were nicknamed The Brooklyn bridegrooms

606
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,872
For while and this was

607
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,152
This is so weird it's because

608
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,992
Six or seven of the team members happen to get married around the same time

609
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
And the nickname just stuck

610
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,624
Wow a lot of like major league teams in the early days

611
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,184
They went by nicknames instead of there

612
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
Official name so it kind of

613
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
It changed a lot

614
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,864
But back in the mid-1890s that's when they first started

615
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,704
Being referred to as the trolley Dodgers thanks to a man named General Henry

616
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Slocum

617
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
It's lightning sounds

618
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,776
Vaguely Familiar

619
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
But please remind

620
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:01,664
So if you've ever heard of the PS General Slocum disaster

621
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,968
That ship was named after the sky

622
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:09,600
He was a Civil War General from Atlanta and then moved to New York after the war and served in Congress

623
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:16,256
And in 1891 General Slocum kind of made it his mission to modernize transportation and bring elect

624
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,840
Electric streetcars do Brooklyn and at first the city denied this

625
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:26,496
This sounds dangerous but in 1892 Brooklyn trolley ordinance passed which

626
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,056
Approved the conversion from horse-drawn to elect

627
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
Was it as dangerous as

628
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
People thought it might be

629
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:39,808
100% for the standard so

630
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,112
Charlie Rose where laid out all over the place like

631
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,208
In Brooklyn and Manhattan and Brooklyn Street for basically already

632
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
Neither of these trolley rails

633
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,536
At first it seemed like a good idea to

634
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,328
We could go faster and you can be

635
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,864
How much more efficient and

636
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,632
Clear

637
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,008
If you can pound that with

638
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,128
The fact that there's pedestrians all over the streets and you're suddenly changing this technology that

639
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,432
People have to with that tooth very quickly

640
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,968
It just becomes

641
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,576
It's funny cuz when I hear the name Charlie Dodgers it actually sounds kind of cute in it

642
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,136
But this is really like the streets were deadly

643
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
84 people all of a sudden

644
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,208
Is giant cards

645
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
We're going very very fast

646
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,792
Yeah yeah

647
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,352
So this is pre automobile culture

648
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
Are so people just weren't used to

649
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,680
Looking both ways before Crossing

650
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,776
The street and horse-drawn trolleys were not very dangerous cuz you

651
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Probably

652
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,896
Briskly power wash Mexico

653
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:42,016
So the electric cars are going a lot faster and it was just catching people off guard and so it required

654
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Color.

655
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Yes

656
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,160
Astrologer going three times fast

657
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,256
And it was so dangerous that in

658
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,816
1892 the first year that they're introduced

659
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
There's five.

660
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,400
The next year there are 51 deaths

661
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:03,264
And by 1895 trolleys and already killed 107 people

662
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
And injured at least

663
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
400 other people

664
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,152
So people are literally having to jump out of the way of these

665
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,248
Basically like death machines

666
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:18,368
These political cartoons from around that time and they're just kind of horse

667
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,672
Okay so

668
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,952
Show me one near it

669
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
In the wake of a cable car

670
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Andaz

671
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,632
Didn't mean to bodies on the street like have run over

672
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,912
Crying

673
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
Dark it really is

674
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
Oh my God

675
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,008
So what would

676
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,824
Possess you to name a baseball team after this

677
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
The weird thing is it was

678
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
I have a compliment

679
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
So you only found Electra

680
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,504
Search Ollie's in highly urbanized areas like New York

681
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,808
Or Chicago so having to act

682
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344
Out of the way

683
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,136
It made you

684
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,184
It was the market like a modern

685
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,280
Cosmopolitan person and also a modern cosmopolitan

686
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,096
City so it was as good on the city was gone the purse

687
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,912
So at what point did the trolleys

688
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:08,288
Disappearing around the 1920s which is around the time that car culture

689
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,080
Sure start popping up so yo

690
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:17,760
But you know that the name stuff the trolley Dodgers stuck and eventually they got shortened to the Brooklyn Dodgers

691
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,320
And then eventually became the Los Angeles Dodgers

692
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,344
When they moved in

693
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
1950s

694
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,416
And when they moved in 1957

695
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,256
What's the red car still going on in Los Angeles for there any trolleys left in Los Angeles

696
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,560
Yes yes there were

697
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
For about

698
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,352
4 years

699
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,656
Dodge like

700
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,728
