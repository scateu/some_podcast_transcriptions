I'm Roman Mars

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,048
In the 1940s there were as there are today a lot of great Art and Design schools in New York City

36
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
Pratt

37
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,584
Cooper Union

38
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
Parsons

39
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:46,240
And there were then as there are today a lot of young talented artists and designers that those schools

40
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
Who would go on to have great careers

41
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,872
But in the 1940s there was something else

42
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
Some of those artists and designers

43
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
How to do

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
That's our own Katie McCall

45
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
There was a war going

46
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,320
World War

47
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
And the Army needed artists

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
Because well

49
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
They had

50
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
Kind of a crazy idea

51
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
And it was a crazy idea that came out of one of the most conservative organizations you can imagine the United States are

52
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,960
That's Rick Beyer more about Rick in a minute

53
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
And had to go up the line

54
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,080
High-ranking generals appetizers Eisenhower himself

55
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
To get approval

56
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
The crazy idea was this

57
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,712
The United States Army with design a deception unit

58
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,296
A unit that would appear to the enemy to be a large Armored Division

59
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,344
Thousands of soldiers

60
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
Tanks

61
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
Trucks guns

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928
Only this unit

63
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,720
Would actually be equipped with fake tanks

64
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Fake truck

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
Fake guns

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,584
And Man by just a handful of soldiers

67
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
And it really is something

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
Unusual

69
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
Rick buyer has a forthcoming book about all of this

70
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
And also made it

71
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Film about it

72
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
Hold That Ghost Army

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
People say to me well did the Germans have something like this

74
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,712
Did the Japanese have something like this

75
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,552
And when I said is the Germans and Japanese did deceptions

76
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,112
But I haven't found anybody

77
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
Ever

78
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,904
Who had

79
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
A unit

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
Quite like this

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,888
But I like groups began landing on the northern coast of France this morning

82
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,192
Strongly supported by Naval and Air Forces

83
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
D-Day

84
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
1944

85
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,592
Want to start of the most critical. Of War

86
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
The Allies landed on the beaches of Normandy and began to liberate France from the Germans who had occupied it for 4 years

87
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
At that point

88
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,576
They were ultimately Marching for Berlin

89
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,880
And the success of the Normandy Landings on

90
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,208
D-Day was due in part to deception

91
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
Using a variety of techniques

92
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
The Allies tricked the Germans into thinking The Invasion would happen at a different time and place

93
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
But a couple of US Army men

94
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,056
Ralph Ingersoll and Billy Harris wanted to take deception to a whole new level

95
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,872
They wanted to create a mobile deception unit

96
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,712
I'm going to put that on the battlefield and give that to the generals to use

97
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
For whatever set of circumstances

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
Come up

99
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,600
What were the circumstances in which a unit like this

100
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
This would be needed

101
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,952
What's the American forces are guarding a border

102
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
But there's a hole in ones

103
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,351
And it's a German the realize there's an unguarded spot

104
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
They can use it to break the line

105
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
But the Americans

106
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
Don't have any troops

107
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
To fill that hole

108
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
Sometimes they can't send the real truth because the real troops are needed someplace house and sometimes they can't send them

109
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Because

110
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,503
They just don't have enough or they can't get them there in

111
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,319
Time that's where the ghost Army came in

112
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:45,439
This top-secret unit was officially called the 23rd headquarters special troops

113
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
And nicknamed The Ghost Army

114
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
After the war

115
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,655
The so-called ghost Army would impersonate a larger Armored Division might be the 6th Armored Division

116
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:01,055
Vision or some other one it changed but a division that was made up of say 15 or 20

117
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,455
Thousand soldiers when they the ghost army or actually only about a thousand men

118
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,271
Make it seem like something is there that isn't there

119
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,087
And if you want people to do that you're going to want artists

120
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:19,231
The Army was interested in recruiting people with art with an art background

121
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,559
Do installations of sorts

122
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
That's Jack Macy

123
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
I'm jacked Macy

124
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
I served

125
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
The ghost Army

126
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,407
Before the Army Jack was just a kid in high school pretty famous High School in New York City called

127
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,551
High School of Music & Art it's now called LaGuardia high school

128
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
Yung Joc is shipped off

129
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,391
Tear up to join the camouflage unit

130
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,487
Where he discovers that a lot of the other guys in his unit are also artists

131
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,279
A good 50%

132
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,863
And one of the things all of the artists have been working on

133
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
Was designing steak

134
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
Tanks and trucks

135
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,775
By the time Jack got done all their R&D

136
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,615
Undecided rubber with the best material to use

137
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,687
And so that's when I discovered my first

138
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
Inflatable tank

139
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
Inflatable rubber tanks

140
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
R A crucial part of the visual deception unit

141
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Souffle

142
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,535
In about a half hour

143
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,839
From nothing to a full tank

144
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
Was rather quite interesting

145
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
Okay

146
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,495
But the visual deception unit had more than just

147
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
It stank

148
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
And trucks

149
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
And artillery

150
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Angie

151
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,247
And all sorts of vehicles virtually every kind of vehicle the Army has

152
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
The ghost Army had

153
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
Inflatable versions of

154
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
Musically

155
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,183
Anything to make themselves appear to be the full size armored divisions that they were

156
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Pretending to be

157
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,535
This stuff was all meant to be believable from a distance

158
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,863
Four planes flying overhead or maybe people looking through binoculars

159
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,935
And at a distance Inflatables were super realistic

160
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
You had to be careful

161
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,007
About certain details

162
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
Sometimes

163
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
The barrels

164
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Of the tanks

165
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,711
The Seroquel of course that was a mess

166
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,527
Plastic gun barrels never a good thing

167
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
But there were other details to consider

168
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,135
A real tank weighs 40

169
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,951
Tons and when it drives across the field

170
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
It leaves

171
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
A set of tank tracks

172
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
Text that are really obvious

173
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
To Ariel LeConte

174
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:36,191
So the deception unit would actually use a bulldozer to make fake tracks around the fake tanks

175
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:41,055
But there was one cardinal rule Jack says about working with inflatables

176
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
Never

177
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
Under any circumstance

178
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
Will you ever

179
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
To carry an inflatable across the road

180
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,319
Obviously two dudes carrying a 40-ton tank would look

181
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Wrong

182
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:59,231
You weren't supposed to casually pick up and move an inflatable vehicle in a place where you could be seen

183
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,071
When the artist soldiers weren't busy with their dummy tanks

184
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
Jack says they did what artist

185
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,935
Still spent that time sketching

186
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,263
Local people local architecture

187
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
Churches

188
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
All through Normandy

189
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
Across France

190
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
And into Germany

191
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,807
During their travels through Europe when they weren't sketching local architecture the ghost Army was often

192
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Acting

193
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
And they call it special effects

194
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,671
And I call it play-acting

195
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Because that's really what it was

196
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,535
And the idea was supposed to go into town

197
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
And sit down at a cafe

198
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
So that anybody watching us

199
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,447
Remember the Germans occupied France

200
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
Dance for four years at this

201
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,287
Yeah there were spies

202
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Everywhere

203
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
We wanted them to sink

204
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,895
That not only did we have

205
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,199
Actual tanks which of course we didn't

206
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,039
But that we actually were members of the 2nd Armored Division

207
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,575
Witchery factory wiring

208
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:01,439
They stenciled fake unit numbers on their trucks they made fake patches to put on their sleeves

209
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,839
Sometimes they seem to be having a little too much fun with this part of the job like the time they stole a bunch of

210
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:14,239
Two cases of expensive cognac from a Tavern just to piss off the tavern owner they knew to be a jerk

211
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
German collaborator

212
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:20,639
They're hoping that he is Dan going to be so angry at them that he's going to go to the Germans and tell him

213
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:26,271
Will not only do I know that the 6th Armored Division is here with their General was at my Tavern today

214
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
The whole point

215
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,087
And the ghost Army

216
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
Want to make sure their presence

217
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
What's known

218
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
The ghost Army needed to be

219
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:38,047
Seen and heard and perceived by the Germans as being real

220
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,143
I'm turntable one goes a recording of trucks moving in

221
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:46,495
Which brings us to the deception unit that I probably would have been drafted into

222
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
Sonic deception

223
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
So they would record the sounds of

224
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,407
Tanks going down Rose or the sounds of truck

225
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,759
Except man reaching a certain point in all the men jumping out and then be able to

226
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,111
Play them back in such a way as to make the enemy think that those things are really happening

227
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:06,207
This was also new and strange that the Army made a top-secret

228
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,791
Film what explain how sound can be used to deceive the enemy

229
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Init

230
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Actors

231
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,447
Badly portray a group of German officers who were in the midst of being punked

232
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,983
But it's Sonic deception unit

233
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
Thanks

234
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
Oot here

235
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
Report Stephen it sounds

236
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
Tanks moving in

237
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Assembly

238
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
About that

239
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,159
The movie goes on to explain that the Germans in that scene were fooled

240
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,743
A Sonic, they had convinced them that an Armored Division

241
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
Under cover of Darkness

242
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,815
That moves along the river lacrosse

243
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,191
Tank destroyers unreserved up here

244
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
They moved into position

245
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
And they waited

246
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,615
And we crossed down here where they were

247
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
The phone goes into great detail

248
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,991
About the process of recording and playing back

249
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,087
Sounds the best loudspeakers

250
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,415
The speakers can project sound as far as 50

251
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Tmall

252
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
And there was a huge library of

253
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Sounds to choose

254
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
He's from

255
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
For example

256
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:19,167
Engines make different sounds depending on the terrain and they had all of those differ

257
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
Kinds of sound

258
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,103
At the little Hill this one projected the sound of Tanks going up

259
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:33,503
This one projected Banks going down

260
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,903
They would look at what they're trying to simulate what are we trying to make people think

261
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,999
And then they would take all the appropriate child

262
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,327
And mix them together to create a

263
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
Sonic

264
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Stewart

265
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
People who heard this

266
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Say that it was

267
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,799
Unbelievably Erie that it was so realistic that

268
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,383
You started seeing vehicles that weren't there

269
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,551
The third component of the ghost army or the radio operators

270
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:12,415
It was well known that the Germans listened in on radio communications of Allied troops

271
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,255
So the ghost Army was trying to impersonate a real Armored Division

272
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,071
It have to send the right kinds of Transmissions

273
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
They bring in

274
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
Trained radio operators from All Sorts about

275
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Units

276
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
To have the very best operators

277
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
Depart of the radio deception

278
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,567
All of the units paid incredible

279
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
Attention to detail

280
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
But the radio operators

281
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
Had to be perfect mimic

282
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:40,575
They had to learn the exact keystrokes of an individual Morse code operator in the unit they were in prayer

283
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,903
The way a radio operator in the

284
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,255
The 4th Armored Division always starts his messages with 4

285
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,559
..

286
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
Because that's just what they do

287
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
And if you don't do that

288
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,703
The German intercept person listening

289
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Is going to say

290
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Will wait a minute

291
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
Does that really from the 4th

292
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
Armored Division

293
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,199
They have three different units visual Sonic and radio and their operating separately but they're

294
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:13,087
All organized by the same people so they're very carefully working on different components of the same plan

295
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,951
The three separate units might only be vaguely aware of what one another were up

296
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
2

297
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,071
And everything was kept completely secret from the rest of the military

298
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,655
It's a fact of their mere existence ever lead to the Germans

299
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
The whole deception

300
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
As well as the safety of the ghost Army

301
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
Could be compromised

302
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,359
The ghost Army carried out 21 different deception mission

303
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Between

304
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,223
June 1944 and

305
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
March

306
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
1940

307
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
35 pretty much the entire time

308
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
The US Army was operating

309
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,463
Rick says one of their most important missions was Operation bettembourg

310
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
Which took place near the border but

311
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
Between France

312
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
In Germany

313
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
So picture this

314
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,911
There's a river near the German border the Moselle River

315
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,495
German troops are on one side and American troops are on the other

316
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
They're part of a front butt

317
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
Hundreds of miles long

318
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,871
General George Patton

319
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,711
Realizes that there is a 75-mile gap in his line

320
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,015
Unguarded 75 MI

321
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,087
But the Germans come across the border

322
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
If they knew about it

323
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
So they bring in

324
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
The ghost Army

325
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,255
So they they arrived in

326
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
About middle of the night

327
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,655
It is in September 44 and they using all three units

328
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,191
Visual unit with insulated

329
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
People tanks

330
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Radio guys

331
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
But especially the Sonic design

332
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Option unit

333
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,127
Because most of the Germans are on the other side of the Mosel River

334
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
There within earshot

335
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
In other words

336
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,503
And so it's a great opportunity to use sound to

337
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
Build it up and make it

338
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
It seem like so many

339
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,391
Hank Snow moving in and so many troops are moving in

340
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
The deception goes on

341
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
For 7

342
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Days

343
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,399
7 days is a long time to fool any

344
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:08,287
The ghost army soldiers are getting nervous they've never done a deception for this long before

345
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,871
And even General Patton is nervous he wrote a letter to his wife

346
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,991
And he says one bad spot my line but I don't think the Huns know about it yet

347
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,343
We're holding on to it by the grace of God will have it plugged by tomorrow

348
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,671
And the next day the 83rd division Moves In

349
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
And takes over for the ghost Army

350
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,767
And the Germans never caught on

351
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
To the ghost Army

352
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,327
During that operation

353
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Or any other

354
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:38,751
Over the course of the war the ghost Army lost three soldiers and had several dozen wounded but overall it was one of the safer

355
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
Assignments of World War II

356
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,383
Being in the camouflage unit I always felt

357
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
I was kind of lucky

358
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
That's Jack Macy again

359
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,575
Camouflage unit was just another name for the visual deception unit

360
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
Wish I had friends

361
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,903
Lahore in the Infantry

362
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
Shovel workout

363
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,535
But being assigned to the camouflage Corps

364
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,839
Away from the front lines

365
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,679
It's true that the ghost Army suffered far fewer casualties than other units

366
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:13,567
That's probably because they were really good at their jobs if their deception was ever uncovered by the Germans

367
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
Would be catastrophic

368
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
For the men in the ghost Army

369
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,223
They're operating without any heavy weapons

370
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,015
They don't have any real artillery

371
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,087
So they're kind of putting on this show of force

372
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,391
In a very vulnerable place

373
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
Jack remembers the Armenians

374
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
Extremely fondly

375
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
He got to see Paris

376
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
See Paris

377
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,863
The great cafes and the Beast Rose

378
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
Completely

379
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Fabulous experience

380
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,311
After Jack Macy left the ghost Army he went to Yale

381
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
School of

382
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
Garden architecture

383
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
GI Bill of Rights

384
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
Thank God

385
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,503
After Yale he went on to design some amazing things

386
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,879
He designed the kitchen used in the American national exhibition in Moscow in 1959

387
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,207
Would a famous debate between Nixon and Khrushchev took place

388
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,351
He work with Buckminster Fuller on a geodesic dome for the 1967 World Expo in Montreal

389
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,911
And Jack Macy wasn't the only artist

390
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,471
In the ghost Army to have a great career

391
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,311
Remember all those artists that were constantly sketching around Europe

392
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
Well some of them became pretty famous

393
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
After the war

394
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
Ellsworth Kelly the

395
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,503
Minimalist painter and sculptor was in this unit

396
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,391
Arthur Singer a wildlife artist to Illustrated birds of North America and many other books

397
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
Bill Blass

398
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
The fashion designer

399
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,279
Jack Macy and Bill Blass we're good friends in the army

400
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,119
Jack likes to say that Bill Blass was the only Soldier

401
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,655
That read Vogue and

402
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Is Fox Hole

403
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
Not only red

404
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
But he made sketches

405
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
Skechers wherever he went

406
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,639
Forever working away

407
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,223
Getting ready for the great moment when he would leave the army

408
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:03,647
The government officially kept the ghost Army a secret into the 1980s because they were hoping to be able to use some of the deception

409
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
Tactics in future complex

410
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,023
Some units were told not to talk about their experience

411
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
Ever

412
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
2NE1

413
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,655
But apparently not everyone got the same directives on this

414
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
I was in Company B

415
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,727
And we were never told

416
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,775
That we were not supposed to talk about it

417
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,103
So I was blabbing about the ghost Army II die

418
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
Leicester

419
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,943
And everybody I had everybody reduced to

420
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
Gigantic laughs

421
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,551
Set amusement wdid as a fake

422
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Yunnan

423
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,903
Pretty amusing thing

424
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
It is amusing but

425
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
Beyond music

426
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,559
Strange and amazing that they tried this

427
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
And that they actually

428
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Pulled it off

429
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
Not every operation

430
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
You know successful

431
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,311
But there's a number of operation

432
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,359
Where it's really clear that

433
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
The Germans

434
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Believed

435
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,455
What they were trying to sell them

436
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
And then it happened

437
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Effect on the

438
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,295
So it did help to save lives

439
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
It did help to win the war

440
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
In the story of the Trojan Horse

441
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,047
After a grueling 10 year war

442
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,863
The Greeks pretend to give up and sail away

443
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,423
Leaving behind a giant wooden horse

444
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
Which the Trojans dragged back into their City

445
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
As a victory trophy

446
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
At night

447
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Italy

448
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,639
Greek fighter as which has been hiding inside the horse

449
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
Creeps out

450
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,711
When is able to capture the city of Troy

451
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
Victory

452
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
My deception

453
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,111
That deception wouldn't have worked very well in World War II

454
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
Ghost armies technique

455
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,951
Probably wouldn't be very useful in today's comp

456
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:46,815
For obvious reasons we can get the Army to tell him what kinds of

457
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
They're doing these days

458
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,655
But you can be sure they're doing some

459
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
Something because

460
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
What this guy said

461
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,079
Deception of the enemy is of course as old as War itself

Okay

490
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:43,296
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

491
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,600
Makes for a much more natural

492
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
