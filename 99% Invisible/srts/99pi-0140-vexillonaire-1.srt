I'm Roman Mars

34
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,440
Here's a trick if you want to design a good flag

35
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,000
Kickass Blacklick Chicago's rdcs

36
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:41,376
Start by drawing a 1 by 1 and 1/2 inch rectangle on a piece of paper

37
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,448
Your design has to work within that tiny rectangle

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,288
3 by 5 foot flag on a

39
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,592
Pull a hundred feet away

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
Looks about the same size as

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
A

42
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
1 by 1 and 1/2 in

43
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,064
Rectangle seeing about 15 inches from your eye

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,904
2 instead of starting with a big canvas for a wide Cinema display

45
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
Try drawing your flag

46
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,000
On a rectangle is 1 by 1 and 1/2 in

47
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,864
You'll be surprised at how compelling and simple the design can be

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
When you hold yourself

49
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
To that limitation

50
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,728
That my friends is Ted k

51
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,080
Ted K I live here in Portland Oregon and I'm involved in the study of flags

52
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:27,968
When I went to his house in Portland he flew the San Francisco flag out front in honor of my visit

53
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:34,368
That's the kind of guy to cast I'm in love with the Portland flag Association we are a Loosely organized

54
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
Group of people interested in Flags

55
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,816
And we are the largest sub national flag organization in the country with the largest membership

56
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
Ship around 25 to Spain number

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,264
The most frequent meeting schedule and the greatest amount of publishing a lot of his fellow backs

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Philologist

59
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
What's a person who studies Flags

60
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
Ted is especially interested in flag design mini other vexillologist are more focused on History protocol

61
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
Send usage

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,808
There's one school of thought that says

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,904
We are flag Scholars and every flag is equally

64
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
Appropriate to study

65
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,328
And whether we like the design or not is immaterial we should be dispassionate scholar

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
But then there are people in the second group like

67
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
Dad and me at this point actually

68
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:25,056
Pool of beautiful flags and go out in the world and Lobby

69
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
For better or

70
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,640
Those who are in the second Camp have identified it

71
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
A name for those

72
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
And that's avexa Lanier

73
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,784
An activist vexillologist

74
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:42,720
You listen to show for a very very long time you know that when it comes to designing Flags

75
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,280
There are rules and principles being

76
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,816
Keep it simple

77
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
Use meaningful symbolism

78
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
Use two to three basic colors

79
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
No lettering or seals

80
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
And be distinctive

81
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,776
Extended Stay

82
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
But one rule the fourth one

83
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
No lettering or seals

84
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,200
That rule for some reason Americans just can't grasp

85
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,040
We have tons of flags

86
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,368
And that's bad that's why you shouldn't have a seal on it

87
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
A seal is designed

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
To be on a piece of paper

89
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
To be seen

90
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Close up

91
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
To be seen

92
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
Flat not moving

93
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
And only one side of the paper

94
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
A flag

95
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
Is meant to be seen

96
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
From a distance

97
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
On a piece of fabric

98
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
That's moving

99
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
And might be seen on the front or the back

100
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,343
Seals don't belong on flags seals belong on pieces of paper

101
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
Damn right

102
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,951
What are the Intriguing things about the fact that Ted gay

103
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:52,351
And the largest sub national flag organization are both based in Portland is that Portland

104
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,447
Official flag of the first 100 Years of its existence

105
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,263
Portland had several flags that had been

106
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,919
Proposed and not officially adopted even though people thought they've been adopted but that was about to change in 1960

107
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
C9

108
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,503
A group proposed a flag to the

109
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
City

110
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,087
The group was the commercial Club of Portland

111
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,159
The proposed design consisted of a Whitefield

112
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Does the background color

113
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
With a

114
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,535
With a city seal

115
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
Engulf the center

116
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,215
Flanked by two red roses on either side

117
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
And then the words

118
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,615
Worldport of the Pacific on top

119
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
And then the words

120
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
City of roses

121
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
Below

122
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
I think I might have to go lie down

123
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,391
And mayor Terry schrunk

124
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Who was

125
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,975
A very astute politician

126
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
Look at this design and said

127
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:58,399
I'm not capable of deciding on a flag design for the city of Portland this is a job for the Portland Arts Commission

128
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
Smart guy indeed

129
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,543
But this decision set into motion one of the greatest tragedies and Redemption

130
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
Vexillological history

131
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:13,503
The Arts commission selected esteemed local artist named Doug Lynch to create a brand new design

132
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,903
Prominent graphic designer that called him a commercial artist at the time

133
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,303
Asking about the city council and the Arts commission which attributes should be on the flag as you might expect

134
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
The

135
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
Members of the

136
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
City Council

137
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
Had a different View

138
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
What a flag should look like

139
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
From what the Arts commission members look like

140
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,615
You don't say the City commissioners were

141
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,967
They wanted realism they wanted the name of the city on the flag

142
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
They wanted

143
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,367
Lots of stuff on the flag of the

144
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:55,231
Parks commissioner said it should be abstract it shouldn't have words on it

145
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,375
Much more consistent with our modern perception of what good flag design is so Doug

146
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,447
Went into The Fray and designed flag

147
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,263
That did not have a rose on it

148
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
Did not have the name of the city on it it was an abstract design Doug's design was a

149
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:20,575
I will call it an offset cross if you go to our website or pull out your phone you'll see a variation of this flag that

150
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
Doug Lynch proposed

151
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,415
It's incorporated into the Comfort I love this episode

152
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,975
Two lines crossing from

153
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,791
Top to bottom and left to right in the center

154
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Creating a

155
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,119
Void in a center that

156
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,703
Is called a hypocycloid a 4 pointed star

157
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,079
The blue lines that cross represented the Confluence of the Columbia and Willamette rivers

158
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,687
The flight hypocycloid represented the city of Portland at their confluence

159
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
And then

160
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:54,111
Those stripes were bordered by yellow stripes gold Stripes which represented either Commerce or

161
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,743
Grain flowing along the rivers and everything was on a background of green representing

162
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
The forest

163
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
It's really lovely

164
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,399
City council said Thank You for Your Design and change the upper left-hand

165
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Corner

166
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
From green to blue and put the city Ceylon

167
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
And adopted that flag

168
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:27,135
I know all the graphic designers in the audience were digging half-moon-shaped scars in the meat of their palms upon here

169
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:33,535
Violation thumb was more painful that this Abomination was so close to being a really good flag

170
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
The one that Doug Lynch had originally submitted

171
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:45,567
A few years to the city council version of the flag made it out into circulation in 1973

172
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
But being a

173
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:53,247
Relatively poor design with that City seal on it most people can't tell it's the city seal even

174
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
Hannibal yellow

175
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
Blob on blue

176
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
The flag was never

177
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
Widely Sloan

178
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,791
So nearly 30 years later Doug Lynch join the Portland flag Association

179
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
He was in his late eighties

180
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,167
And I invited him to come to one of our meetings

181
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,495
And explain this whole story of how he had

182
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
Designed the flag

183
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,383
How it was adopted and how was changed at the last minute

184
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,943
At the end of the presentation

185
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Said

186
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
If I had to do it

187
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,903
Over again I would widen the blue stripes the center of the flag over a little

188
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,303
Take that upper left-hand Corner which is blue and change it back to green and he would take that City seal

189
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
Off the flag

190
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,167
How to make all those that's how I would do the flag but it's been 30 years

191
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
Too late now

192
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,007
And they're like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait a minute

00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:52,383
We're the largest of national flag organization in the country it's not too late

194
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919

197
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:06,207
The person who actually manufactures those flags and you who designed it

198
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
We ought to be able to get this changed

199
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:13,887
And with the help of future Portland mayor Sam Adams they presented an ordinance to the city council

200
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
To update the flag

201
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,239
My son Mason who had written the history of the city flags

00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,343
Was a revered figure in

211
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391

The commission

213
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,975
Ineffective bowed and said

214
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,559
You're the right person to tell us what this designer to look like

215
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351

220
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,311
Come back next week and will adopt it but bring a real flag

221
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Can you do that

222
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
And my tail

223
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,943
Owner of the Flag Company gulfton said yes we can do that

224
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
And so the next week

225
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,831
He had his seamstresses sew up a new city of Portland flag

226
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
We

227
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,903
Came to the city council hearing

228
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
The council

229
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,743
Held a vote on the ordinance 520 they

230
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279

And meerkats said

232
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,143
Pointing to the old flag on the flagpole

233
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,751
Take that down and put it in archives can you put that new flag up

234
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
And so one of our members John Hood

235
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
Went over and

236
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,151
Put the flag on a flagpole in the city council chambers

237
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
Being the first one to raise

238
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223

240
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039

00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:41,183

Good flag

245
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,887
Best of all people in Portland actually use it

246
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
Especially because of a soccer game

247
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,495
If you don't see your City flag anywhere in your hometown

248
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
Maybe it needs a redesign to

249
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871

Bongs and chatter of our devices

257
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,599
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

258
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
If

259
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,231
