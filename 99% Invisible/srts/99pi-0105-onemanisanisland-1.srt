This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars

19
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
There is this moment in my life when I needed to interview the rapper Busta Rhymes for the radio and this is friend of the show

20
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:23,456
Shawn Cole and sorry I tried calling his people which got me pretty much net worth

21
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
Then tried Googling Busta Rhymes and Boston which is where I was living at the time cuz I figured

22
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,000
Babies coming on tour in a good Ambush and backstage and one of the first results I got

23
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,560
It was a map like on Google Map

24
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:43,424
Of a little pond in Shrewsbury Massachusetts which is this little

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,824
Town outside of Austin and in the pond was this tiny Speck of land

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,920
And labeled Busta Rhymes Island

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,784
What

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,464
Needless to say I was a little confused

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
Shrewsbury is like the least likely benefit of all the for there to be a bus

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,728
Catherines Island anywhere is pretty unlikely but but Shrewsbury is like his bedroom community for

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Worcester it's not even

32
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,848
Is like the most exciting thing to do there on a Saturday night is going to Chili's

33
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,896
After like

34
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:31,296
Shopping at Lumber Liquidators and I was like is this for real and then underneath

35
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
Meet the link for the map

36
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
With another link

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
To this short little

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,952
Blurb in the Boston Globe

39
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
With a headline

40
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,792
Busta Rhymes Island Is For Real

41
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,096
Send

42
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:50,496
And they interviewed

43
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,824
Kevin O'Brien who lives in house overlooking the pond

44
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616
Millpond is the name of it

45
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,432
And who this is still true

46
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,296
List his phone number as the number to call if you want to contact the island

47
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,624
So he's a guy who named the alley the one named Ian

48
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,696
And this is a quote from the the Boston Globe

49
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
This guy Kevin says

50
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,584
It's a very small little island with rope swinging blueberries

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
And

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
Stuff Buster would enjoy

53
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,240
Adorable

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
So

55
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,872
So just to give you a sense of the differences

56
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
Between Busta Rhymes

57
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
And Busta Rhymes Island

58
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,064
Is like an internationally known

59
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,160
Really fast rapper with 10 albums has got at the other one

60
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:45,280
Being me and I went right yes no man is an island

61
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,864
After all

62
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,936
But also just sonically

63
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,336
Busta Rhymes sounds like this

64
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
Busta Rhymes Island

65
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,664
Sounds like this

66
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
So what about this island

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
Would you say bespeaks

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
Busta Rhymes

69
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,512
Just pretty much the kind of feel of it

70
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,863
This is Kevin O'Brien I drove out to Shrewsbury to spend some time with him on the island

71
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
It was cold

72
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
February

73
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,703
We walked across the ice to get there

74
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
Little more about Kevin he's in his early 30s

75
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,335
Works in tech support and DJ's wedding on the weekend

76
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
You know if you come out here in the summertime it's

77
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,431
A really nice relaxing place to be

78
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
It's it's

79
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Dead Silence

80
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
It's really really Loki in

81
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:44,415
Who wouldn't let us aren't aspects of Busta Rhymes dead silent emoji

82
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
He meditates

83
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:50,303
Kevin started canoeing out to the island about 10 years ago now when he and his wife first moved here

84
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
The pain is practically in their front yard it's a teeny tiny Speck of land you mean

85
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
40 feet

86
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519
And that the end there is a rope swing

87
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
Hanging from one of the trees

88
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,175
And blueberry bushes which Kevin planted just visit the island a bunch he takes

89
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Caribbean island

90
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,271
Cleaned up after the teenagers who have beer cans laying around

91
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,599
Drinks beer himself on the island with his wife and their friends

92
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
And when you love a place

93
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,183
The way Kevin love this place

94
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,255
You don't want to refer to a generic lady that just doesn't feel respectful

95
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
So

96
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
One day

97
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,351
I was sitting around with my friend Brandon

98
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
And we just

99
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
Started talking about

100
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,751
How we are always coming over the island and he asked what his name was

101
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,943
Who started saying we'll have a Busta Rhymes Island restaurant everybody was Busta Rhymes

102
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,063
Tell me the directions to my house I know you know just look up Busta Rhymes Island on Google Maps and follow your way there

103
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
I think it sounds a lot better than saying Millpond so

104
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
We went we want Busta Rhymes and

105
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
We have a lot of respect for him

106
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511
So how did you get it on Google Maps

107
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,911
We just stopped just apply Tajima tag to it it's that easy it's that easy and really the whole thing with seem like a big

108
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Big joke

109
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,775
If it weren't for all the effort Kevin went through to try to make the name stick

110
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,615
Around the time I contacted him he submitted a formal proposal

111
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,687
To the US board on Geographic names

112
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,759
Besides with the federal government is going to call a piece of land

113
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
He showed me the proposal

114
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Feature class

115
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
Island

116
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Meaning or significance

117
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:24,255
Busta Rhymes is a gravel voice rapper we all have an incredible amount of respect for

118
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
Supporting materials

119
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
No

120
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
They turned him down

121
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
But not for the reasons you might think

122
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,471
The only way you can name the island or a body of land

123
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
After

124
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
Celebrity

125
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Is in a commemorative patch

126
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
Cancel that person has to be deceased

127
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
For five years so

128
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
Fortunately

129
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
Really can't be official until

130
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Basta Pasta

131
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
That could be a long time I'm willing to wait

132
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,183
So someone has to be dead for 5 years before the board will consider naming a place after that person that's right

133
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,791
What my five-year-old I wanted the same thing so I called a blue Yost

134
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,631
Who's the executive secretary at the US board on Geographic names

135
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
Regarding domestic

136
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
Names in the United States

137
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
Forenames is another

138
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,055
Anyway when someone passes away

139
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
Soon after person's death

140
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Emotional time

141
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Close

142
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Relatives

143
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Friends

144
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
Feel they want to do something

145
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
2

146
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
To honor this person

147
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
It's like you're waiting

148
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
What's it settle

149
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:32,351
Do are people disappointed when you tell them about the five

150
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
After explain the reasoning they

151
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,727
Weather disappointed they they agree

152
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
I really say they agree

153
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,431
That it that it has to be still want to name an island after that person half a decade later

154
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
Type of sentimentality

155
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
Right

156
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,879
Lou Yost says the board actually discourages naming places after people at all

157
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
ID rather than a bee

158
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
Future Bass

159
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,767
That is having something to do with the way an island or mountain or a river

160
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
Looks or sounds

161
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
How big it is

162
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Rather than who homesteaded

163
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,191
But with the exploration of the West and Alaska

164
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
It was bound to happen

165
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,823
These guys have been around a long time

166
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
1890

167
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
6 days after JFK was shot

168
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
Soap 1963

169
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,343
Lyndon Johnson announced the Cape Canaveral would be renamed Cape Kennedy

170
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,647
To commemorate the president

171
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183
Jackie Kennedy's idea

172
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Well

173
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,791
People in Florida did not like that at all

174
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:38,143
Why not have been called Cape Canaveral for like 400 years

175
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
And I didn't know this can a parole

176
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
Is a Spanish word

177
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,567
It roughly means a plantation of canes or reeds

178
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:53,247
10 years later the Florida legislature voted to change the name back from

179
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
And the board went along with it

180
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
And it was this event

181
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
That led to the one-year waiting period

182
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,207
But it was a five-year waiting. It was one year then

183
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
New Year's in in 19

184
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
95.7

185
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
And there has never

186
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Never

187
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,191
Been an exception to the rule since then

188
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:18,591
No naming places after people who have been dead less than 5 years and certainly no naming a

189
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
Place after someone who's still alive

190
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
It's a board starts naming features for

191
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
Living people

192
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
And then

193
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
They going

194
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Heinous

195
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
It's not going to look

196
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Look good

197
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,815
Busta Rhymes is being accused of using gay slurs at a fast-food restaurant in Miami this was at

198
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
Cheeseburger Baby

199
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:46,751
In Miami Beach and he was apparently therefore some promotional purposes and

200
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,879
Then I'm looking fell There It Is by

201
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,487
As I was learning about all of this I remember this one place that have been named after someone

202
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,351
Not while he was living but not that long after you died either and here we are

203
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,703
Central Square in Cambridge Cambridge Massachusetts

204
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
Where I was born

205
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
Black sign in the sidewalk

206
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,615
Says Mark Sandman Square

207
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
Corner of Brookline Street and

208
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
Mass Ave

209
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,551
Martin is another musician who was the lead singer of the band morphine

210
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,599
He died in 1999

211
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,415
Collapsed on stage during a concert in Italy

212
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,279
And then just one year later this sign went up on this corner

213
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Right outside the Middle East

214
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
The Middle East nightclub Merced menu

215
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Forum

216
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
Or just hang out

217
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
The sign was Joseph satyrs idea

218
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
He's one of the owners of The Middle

219
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,455
Do you remember the dead of the dedication ceremony

220
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,575
I think it just Public Work Wallace and they said the sign is it ready

221
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Do you know

222
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
So wonderful to sign up

223
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
What flowers in March

224
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
Branson national Park

225
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,815
You know in his memory and nothing of the good time

226
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:20,959
So how was Joseph able to dedicate the corner to Mark Sandman only one year after he died

227
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,519
When the regulation says that he has to wait at least five years

228
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,079
The way you're explaining any would have been relegated to

229
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:32,735
City of Cambridge this is Lou Yost again at the u.s. board on Geographic names

230
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Building

231
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Would be what we

232
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Considerate

233
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Administrative features

234
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,159
The board has relegated that it's already named

235
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
Best features to the local

236
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Administrative

237
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Would be up to the city

238
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,191
Explain the five-year rule to Joseph at the Middle East

239
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
And how

240
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,311
Especially in that first year of course everybody wants to name something after their loved one who died

241
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
Everybody want out

242
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
Stop on the wagon

243
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,687
You want to name every if they wanted him everything everything after

244
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:08,575
Understand. It wasn't like this was my you know I mean definitely will missed him he moved on

245
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,135
Who got cheated by not having him around.

246
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
It was an emotional itsuno admits

247
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
You know friend around

248
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Venom

249
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,423
They did a lot of this community every time you call on him for

250
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:28,287
Fundraising auto show you know he's there to play for free or barely any money cell

251
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,639
Definitely you did due diligence social you know

252
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
What would he think of the signs you think

253
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
If the square

254
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
He wouldn't he would laugh

255
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
Funeral but doesn't matter

256
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
I also got in touch with the mayor's office in Cambridge

257
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
To ask what the

258
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,231
The criteria are for naming a corner of

259
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
The city after someone

260
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:52,607
They sent me the application you fill out when you want one of those signs hammered into the sidewalk

261
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,423
Mark Sandman would fit under the category

262
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,055
Distinguished careers by present or former residents who have achieved state or national Fame

263
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,895
And then I asked them if the person in question had to be deceased

264
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
And they didn't respond

265
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,503
But on the application it says

266
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,319
Deceased it's in it with a?

267
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,927
And then a box of checks that makes it sound like you can memorialize people who are still alive

268
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
Or it's just like a test

269
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:25,631
Because I remove all the ones that are still alive

270
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
But then I started noticing

271
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,543
Those black commemorative signs

272
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,359
Everywhere all around Cambridge

273
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,919
John tijani Collins Square

274
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,759
Commander Francis X buddy Foster Square

275
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
Robert E Goodman Road

276
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
It's

277
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,599
Been very loose

278
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,183
This is Charley Sullivan with the Cambridge historical Commission

279
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
Anyone

280
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,071
Who is interested in having a square named after a family member like

281
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,655
The stairs one of those signs right on the corner Helen and John black Square

282
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
Could just ask a city councillor

283
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
And they would put in a council order

284
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
The city would do it

285
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
So we have intersection

286
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,895
In some parts of town that have one of those

287
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
Signs on each other

288
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
The four corners

289
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Really

290
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Yeah

291
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
Preponderance

292
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Dedication

293
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
Preponderance

294
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
Proliferation of dedication

295
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
You seem you seem

296
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
Not so pleased

297
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,279
Well it gets to be a little

298
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
Instead of a clutter after a while

299
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
And they begin to lose their meaning

300
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
So I think the

301
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
City council is a little more resistant

302
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
Used to be they're running out of places to put these

303
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:42,431
So I just to be clear these places they're not recognized by the US Board of geographic names

304
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,503
Maps are used by the federal government in any way but

305
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
That said

306
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,135
Local usage is something the board takes into account when it's evaluating a proposal

307
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,463
And not just the local Authority recognizing the name

308
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
But the locals

309
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Those Folks up there

310
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
In that house

311
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,375
Getting that Over Yonder this is Kevin O'Brien again

312
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:07,007
That Busta Rhymes Island we would have to go to them and say hey do you know the name of that Island if they were psycho that's

313
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,335
Busta Rhymes island or whatever else we're going to name it

314
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
Then that would be considered local usage so if

315
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
If local folks know what to call it

316
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
Everybody calls it that

317
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:21,087
Then you have a lot more a lot more weight going to the government and saying I'd like to name this island

318
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
But as far as Heaven Knows

319
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,231
Nobody except for him and his wife and their friends call this island anything

320
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
We spent about an hour on the island together

321
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
I like

322
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
Is very cold

323
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:41,311
And just as we're about to leave these two kids have been skating out in the middle of the pond came wandering over

324
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Two boys

325
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Maybe 10 years old

326
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Morning

327
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,503
Doing a radio story about The Silence

328
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,063
Do you know anything about this island

329
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
I just moved here how did you

330
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,719
Well if you if you look up this island on Google Maps

331
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
Christina what it's called

332
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,303
It's called Busta Rhymes Island

333
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
Do you know who that is

334
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
Nope he's a rapper

335
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
Firewood

336
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
She named after

337
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
G named after him

338
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
Cuz he's a big fan

339
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
Would you name this island

340
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
You can name it something

341
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
I don't know

342
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,551
Wait wait all the shoes very Island

343
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
Shrewsbury

344
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
Do you have a favourite

345
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
Musician or anything like that

346
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
No

347
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Busta Rhymes Island

348
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
Great to meet you guys

349
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
Local usage Ram

350
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,615
Give us right we just witnessed Busta Rhymes Island being used

351
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:54,271
I did call them into it exactly into it

352
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,367
Say I did try contacting Busta Rhymes again

353
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,439
Those managers all about the islands that I wanted to interview on

354
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,255
Again they never responded

355
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,071
Also a few days after I first emailed them

356
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
Google Maps

357
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,167
And the geotag was gone

358
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,471
I contacted Kevin right away

359
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
First I've heard of it

360
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
And he said

361
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
Well I know what I have to do

362
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,383
At it again and see how long it takes to be taken down again

363
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Sure enough

364
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
Couple weeks later

365
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
Busta Rhymes Island

366
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
