Family ghosts is a podcast explores all the unexpected ways our family structure and shape our view

8
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:31,488
Of the world

9
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:37,888
Each episode of Family ghosts takes a look at the story behind a different person's family lore digging into

10
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,936
Unanswered questions about their history

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:46,336

00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:52,736
So what about uncovering the secret scroll in a newly discovered stack of love letters and Moon episode that brings you alone

13
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:59,136
On the hunt for a container of missing Chinese food that's haunted a family for 25 years and more

Subscribe to family goes wherever you get your podcast and find out why they say

15
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,768
Every house is haunted

16
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,352
This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars

17
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,680
Our motto is always read the plaque

18
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,592
It's always worth stopping to see what person or event is being commemorated in stone and Metal

19
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,688
Person being depicted is not always worthy the story being told

20
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
If not always true

21
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,600
Lights off until you more about the person who commissioned them than historical figure that they are honoring

22
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,416
It's still worth always read the plaque

23
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,696
But it's not enough

24
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
To just meet the black

25
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,144
If I did nominate one person to write all the flags in the world my choice would be Nate dimeo of the Memory Palace

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,496
He produced an episode about a statue and an imagined plaque in 2015

27
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
Adjust destroys meat so good

28
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,360
I've been thinking about it a lot recently

29
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
And I want you here

30
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,224
Notes on an imagined plaque

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,296
To be added to the Statue of General Nathan Bedford Forrest

32
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,368
On hearing the Memphis city council has voted to move it

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
An exhume remains of General Forrest and his wife

34
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
Mary Ann Montgomery Forrest

35
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,792
From their current location in a park downtown

36
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,840
The nearby Elmwood Cemetery

37
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
First it should be big but black

38
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
But necessarily because there's so much to say

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
So there is so much to say

40
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:25,920
But big enough to be noticed on the side of this rather Grand Monument after they move it and the bodies beneath it

41
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,712
Across town to the cemetery

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272
And that's as big for the sake of bigness

43
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
He needs to stick out

44
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Is something off

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,416
Something that disrupts the admirable balance of the statue

46
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,952
Currently so tasteful

47
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
Regal even

48
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,536
Is bronze man on this bronze horse

49
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
Goatee

50
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Square jaw

51
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
You got it

52
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
You seen it before

53
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,448
Even if you haven't seen it before

54
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
The statue faces North

55
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,568
This culture wanted for us to face South

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
You better catch the Light

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
But people complained

58
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,200
Implied that the general was retreating

59
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,248
And he wasn't a man who retreated

60
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
He surrendered once

61
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,600
But if this culture face North

62
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,904
Maybe people would forget that part

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
I guess

64
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,256
She has to be big enough to catch your eye

65
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,144
When you're checking your cell phone or walking your dog eating a chicken Caesar salad from a plastic box and a bench

66
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,752
Whatever people are doing there in the cemetery and whatever they might do there in the future

67
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,800
Because that's why we make these things right

68
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Plaques

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,872
Bronze man on bronze horses

70
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
You want people in the future to remember

71
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
But first we want them to notice

72
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,112
So let's think about material for this imagine black

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
Because the flag should be garish

74
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,768
Not intentionally ugly not necessarily but like titanium Maybe

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,864
A patch of Frank gehry futurism on the stage state legal thing

76
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
Catch the lion

77
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
The catch the eye

78
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,008
In contrast to the northward facing brown green man

79
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
On his brown green horse

80
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
Or a great pigeon

81
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,640
Elite on his brown green at Gillette

82
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,456
I like that the Geary of it all the futurism

83
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,272
Is not at all futuristic it's millennial

84
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,856
A decade from now it'll be dated literally dated

85
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,952
Do Bauer Disney Hall or wherever will seem so late 90s

86
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
So 2000s

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
Window scarf

88
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
They want that

89
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
I want this pain to be fixed in time

90
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Let people know when it went up

91
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
Let people know what was up at the time

92
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
Because Dad at the point here

93
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,591
The point of this plaque is to make sure that these future people realize

94
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,639
That this lovely old statue

95
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
Wasn't always old

96
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
He wasn't always here in the cemetery

97
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
And moreover I want the reader

98
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,087
Standing there in the shadow cast by the late

99
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
Somehow still demented

100
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
Nathan Bedford Forrest

101
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,719
Once and future summer Sunday

102
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,047
To know why it wound up in a park and the other side of town in the first place

103
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
Because memorials aren't memories

104
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
They don't just appear upon death

105
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
Letter of surrender

106
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,775
Signing some Farmhouse at the edge of some Battlefield

107
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,615
Doesn't come complete with a historic marker it fixed the door

108
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
The monument to Nathan Bedford Forrest

109
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,295
Was put in that park downtown for a reason

110
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,599
At a specific Moment In Time

111
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,695
And at that time General Forest in mrs. forest

112
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
We're already buried in Elmwood Cemetery

113
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,327
The same place the city council recently voted to put them

114
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
His body

115
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
In her body

116
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,191
Were originally dug up from the ground

117
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,751
Because a group of prominent memphians

118
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
Thought they were better off somewhere else

119
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
That was 1905

120
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
40 years after the war

121
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,199
30 years after Forest death

122
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,783
They felt the city needed Nathan Bedford Forrest right then

123
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,855
Because they had seen that City fall from Great Heights

124
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,183
Memphis have been left relatively unscathed by the war

125
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
But not by its outcome

126
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
Not by the end of the slave trade

127
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,863
That had been one of the economic and cultural pillars of the city

128
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,703
Without the slave market selling men and women and children

129
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,287
Without the river boats and Crews and suppliers and dockworkers

130
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
Sending them up and down the river

131
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
Memphis was Harley Memphis anymore

132
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
And then there was the yellow fever

133
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,039
And it swept through the city some years before in killed so many

134
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
I drove many more away

135
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,159
People who never returned after a mandatory evacuation

136
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
And now it was the turn of the next century

137
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,767
In the city was increasingly

138
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
What you said

139
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
Which has stopped not saying things

140
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
Increasingly black

141
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
Increasingly tense

142
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,983
What businesses did not like competing with black businesses

143
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,287
Black people do not like being lynched

144
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:43,199
This move to move Forest started not long after Ida B Wells a memphian to get started writing

145
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Rabble-rousing

146
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
Boldly bravely

147
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
Against lynching

148
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,367
After her friend Thomas Moss was improperly imprisoned

149
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,695
After a fight between children over a game of marbles

150
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,023
Escalated into adults were threatening to burn down a store

151
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
And after Moss wound up being pulled from that prison

152
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Inspiron from a tree

153
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,447
In Wells with threaten so much so often

154
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
But she moved away

155
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,799
In the paper should written for burn to the ground

156
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,871
So wealthy white Memphis

157
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,175
The beginning of the 1900s

158
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
Found all this unpleasant

159
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
So they raise money

160
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
$33,000

161
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,367
Not to rebuild that newspaper office

162
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,951
Or build a police force that would properly protect all of its citizens

163
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,815
But to make a monument to a man they thought best represented a Memphis they lost

164
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
A man who had risen from nothing

165
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
A blacksmith's boy

166
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
Who became a millionaire

167
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
Men believe so strongly in the Confederate cause

168
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
Enlisted as a private

169
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,151
Then went on to prove himself perhaps the most brilliant military man

170
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
Born on American soil

171
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
Even if you didn't fight for America

172
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Those are facts

173
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
It's a true story

174
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,391
And they like what this story said about the American dream

175
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
Even if it wasn't technically American

176
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,047
Even if Forest million was made by buying and selling human beings

177
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
In selling cotton raised and picked

178
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
And cleaned and packed

179
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
Enslaved human beings

180
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,751
Even if the cause for which employee that military genius

181
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
Was to ensure that men like him

182
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
Can Rise Up from nothing

183
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
And make $1000000

184
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,431
Buying and selling human beings

185
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
And stealing their lives in their labor

186
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,367
In 1905 they held a parade at the unveiling of the new Statue

187
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,695
Inmate speeches to honor the northward facing General

188
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,743
They said nothing of slavery

189
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
They said much about heritage

190
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
And honor

191
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
Chivalry

192
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,167
They said nothing of how Nathan Bedford Forrest

193
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,239
I've been the first Grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan

194
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,287
Nothing of the terror it had wrought

195
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
Nothing of the assassinations

196
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
For the lynchings

197
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,711
Nothing of how it sought to undermine and overthrow the nation's political order

198
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,807
The nation that they celebrated their in Memphis in 1905

199
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
When they play The Star-Spangled Banner

200
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
Yankee Doodle Dandy

201
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
Right alongside Dixie

202
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
They might not have mentioned any of it

203
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
But they knew it

204
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
New about forest in the clan

205
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
They certainly read the Clansman

206
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
Was flying off the shelves that year

207
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,215
A novel about heroic man

208
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
Hidden beneath bed sheets

209
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,823
How to save white virtue from black barbarians

210
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
It was a historical romance

211
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
The top billed itself

212
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,991
It look back longingly to a time not long before

213
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,295
When people were still chivalrous

214
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,599
Would stand up against barbarism

215
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
In miscegenation

216
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Instability

217
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
And stand up for order

218
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,487
Private property

219
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,583
Who better to represent what they had lost in Nathan Bedford Forrest

220
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,143
They talked about his heroism in battle

221
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
Don't they didn't talk about the Battle of Fort Pillow

222
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,031
Rainforest ordered the massacre of hundreds of American troops

223
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Attempting to surrender

224
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,871
Most of them former slaves

225
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
We talked about his faith instead

226
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
Is strapping build

227
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
About their own homes

228
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,343
The Future memphians Would gaze upon Nathan Bedford Forrest

229
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
And be inspired

230
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,439
They even raise some extra cash for skating rink

231
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
So that the white children of Memphis

232
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,559
Play nearby in the shadow of this great man

233
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
And learn from his shining example

234
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,911
Do the bronze wouldn't Shine for long

235
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,239
With brown and green is the symbol of all that was good

236
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
Disposable light of the Sun

237
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
Washed by the rain

238
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
There is debate

239
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
There is always debate

240
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,247
About what the client meant when Forest was its wizard

241
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,551
Bad as intentions at Fort Pillow

242
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,135
They say forest repented his sins in his crimes in his Deathbed

243
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
Should that be in the black

244
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,487
She didn't notice his regret

245
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
Missingno

246
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
May it have ruined him

247
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,679
May it have corroded him like rain on bronze

248
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Made him choked him

249
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,567
Like smoke from the crosses in homes and churches

250
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,895
Sprint by man who revered him decades and decades later

251
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
Revered him at least in part

252
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
Because some influential memphians

253
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,807
Decided they needed to Revere him in this way

254
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
And that Park

255
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
1905

256
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
To the blacks to be big

257
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
But it can't be big enough to say all that

258
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
Maybe it's you just say

259
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
Maybe they should all say

260
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,655
Many many thousands of Confederate memorials and monuments and markers

261
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,239
Did the men who fought and died for the CSA

262
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,543
Whatever their personal reasons

263
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
Whatever was in their hearts

264
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,639
Did so on behalf of the government

265
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
Form for the express purpose

266
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,247
Of ensuring that men and women and children

267
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
Can be bought and sold

268
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
Destroyed it will

269
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
Maybe that should be enough

270
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,695
But I want people to know about those memphians 1905

271
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,511
Wanted people to remember for us

272
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
And why

273
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,607
Wanted a symbol to hold up in Revere

274
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
To stand for what they valued most

275
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,007
I want people to know that that statue stood in Downtown Memphis

276
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,799
For a hundred and ten years

277
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,871
It's remember that memorials aren't memories

278
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
They have motives

279
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
There are historical

280
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
They are not history itself

281
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
I want them to know why it was moved

282
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
That in 2015

283
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
After clementa Pinckney

284
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
Sharonda coleman Singleton

285
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
Tywanza Sanders

286
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
An apple Lance

287
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
And Susie Jackson

288
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
And Cynthia heard

289
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
And Myra Thompson

290
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:29,311
And Daniel Simmons senior independent Middleton doctor were murdered in a church in Charleston South Carolina

291
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
There were people in Memphis who are done with symbols

292
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,479
And ready to bury Nathan Bedford Forrest for good

293
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:46,719
In 2016 the Tennessee historical commission ended up denying the Memphis city council's plan

294
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,791
To move the Nathan Bedford Forrest statue from the park

295
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,607
It's still there as of August 2017

296
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,215
The events in Charlottesville Virginia have resulted in protest at the site of the statue

297
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,287
And renewed calls by the public and City officials

298
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
To have the monument removed

299
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

307
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,159
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

308
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183

It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound make

321
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
For a much more natural experience

322
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
Turn the living room lights on

323
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,823
