My Roman Mars

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,440
Barbara Visser was 9 years old the first time she saw it

28
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:38,304
She was on the school field trip to the State art museum in the center of Amsterdam

29
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,352
I guess it's about

30
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,888
1975

31
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,288
They were really at the Forefront of

32
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,848
Modern and contemporary art

33
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,408
The State Electric was built to impress

34
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
A huge

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
Stairway

36
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:02,880
Leading up to the light anyway a bit biblical stairway

37
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,720
Note to heaven but almost to Heaven 2

38
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
The whole of all nurse

39
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,096
Has displayed some of the Museum's finest paintings

40
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,912
In particular dominated the room

41
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,496
The tour guide LED Barbara and her class over

42
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,824
And this painting it struck me

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
Like lightning

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
And not in a positive way

45
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:30,016
What you saw was a massive canvas 18 ft wide and 8 feet tall

46
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,832
On the left side of a small strip of blue

47
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
On the right

48
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
A small strip of yellow

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,488
But the rest of the surface was painted entirely red

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
This Majestic

51
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Fire truck red

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,632
It's kind of annoyed me

53
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
It's really

54
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
I didn't know

55
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
What to look at

56
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
Where to

57
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,336
What to do with it

58
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,896
And the only thing that the guides

59
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,200
Shared with us was the title

60
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,248
And the title is

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Question

62
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,112
Who's afraid of red yellow and blue

63
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,416
Angry

64
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,720
Iran

65
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
I sat on the steps and

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
Was

67
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,096
Determined to go in

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
The full title of the painting Barbara saw that day is who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3

69
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
By the American post-war artists

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,408
Barnett Newman producer John Cecile brings us this Tale

71
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
The galleries

72
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,040
Usually you walk into a museum is he a painting

73
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,856
You think about it for a moment maybe feel something

74
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
And walk away

75
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
Not this one

76
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,280
This was a painting that would produce such strong reactions in people

77
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
That they did more

78
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
Think about it

79
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
Denis and Barbara got off easy

80
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,776
She only struggle with the painting her entire life and made a feature-length documentary about it

81
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,104
It's called the end of fear and inspired the story

82
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
And

83
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,968
This story is about a reaction the painting received that was

84
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
So intense

85
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
So violent

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
It set off a chain of events

87
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,880
That Shook the art world to its core

88
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
Wasn't easy art

89
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
But first

90
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
Why this painting

91
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
The problem

92
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,863
Of the subject

93
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
Became

94
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
Very clear to me

95
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
As a crucial thing in painting

96
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,543
Barnett Newman was a late bloomer

97
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,359
A substitute art teacher turned art critic

98
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
Turned artist

99
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,455
He didn't have his first solo show until he was almost

100
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
45

101
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:41,599
She was as portly Jewish guy with a big friendly mustache who wore a lot of bow ties

102
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,903
And went by the nickname Barney

103
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
And he quickly became the de-facto spokesman for a new art movement called abstract expressionism

104
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,887
A painter is a kind of choreography of space

105
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,215
Create kind of a dance of elements

106
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,615
Abstract expressionism came out of New York after World War II

107
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,431
The movement please painters like Jackson Pollock

108
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,991
Mark rothko and Helen frankenthaler

109
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Artist

110
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,343
Known for big canvases full of wild colors

111
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
Shapes and splashes of paint

112
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:22,047
Like many abstract expressionist artists Newman struggled with what to paint in the aftermath of the war

113
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,119
I thought the issue Emoji is was

114
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
Odoo

115
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
After all

116
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
What could you paint after the Holocaust

117
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
Hiroshima

118
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:40,479
Human answering this question required ignoring all of art history and starting from scratch

119
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
He began making large painting

120
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Big

121
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
Even by abstract

122
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
Expressionist standards

123
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,951
Austin filling the entire wall of a gallery

124
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
Billions size doesn't come

125
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
It's scale accounts

126
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
Humanscale account

127
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
These paintings were

128
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
Physically big

129
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
NFL even bigger

130
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,823
They featured very few colors

131
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,663
Usually one solid Hue broken up by a few vertical stripe

132
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,967
Whatever you do don't call him stripes

133
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
I did not decide

134
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
The saying to myself

135
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
I'm going to paint stripers

136
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,903
Newman preferred to call them zip

137
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,975
I feel that my

138
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
Does not divide my painting

139
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
I feel it does the exact opposite

140
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,679
It creates a totality

141
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
In 1967

142
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,799
Newman finished what would prove to be one of his largest painting

143
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,359
Who's afraid of red yellow and blue

144
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
3

145
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
It was the third in a series

146
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,271
The title was a reference to who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf

147
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
A landmark play

148
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
Later a movie

149
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
Starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton

150
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:58,047
About a relationship full of miscommunication be careful not to pieces accuseal

151
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,399
Betrayal

152
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Total

153
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,311
In a sense this big red painting with a slender zip of blue on the left

154
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,127
Play Slender zip of yellow on the right

155
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
Was Newman's way of saying

156
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
This is what a painting can do

157
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
But

158
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,063
What was the painting doing exactly

159
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,463
Barbara Visser says that when the state elect Museum acquired who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3 and 19 6

160
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
69

161
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
Why do people did not like it

162
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,607
Ashley let's go with the spice people despised

163
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
At the time

164
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
People would ride

165
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,239
Really long and elaborate letters

166
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
Touche how much they hated

167
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Face painting

168
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,663
The painting evoked a common complaint about abstract art

169
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,247
Which is the throw your hands up and say why is this art

170
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,575
I paid to see art dammit not red paint on a canvas

171
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
Anybody can do that

172
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,183
There was one woman who Express that

173
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,255
It's really nauseated her and

174
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,559
Really literally made her sick

175
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,959
She felt it better be hung out of the CO2

176
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
Cochic

177
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
In 1986

178
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,895
The painting was the centerpiece of an exhibit called

179
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
The grand parade

180
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
La Grand Parada

181
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
Express CC Sabathia ejected

182
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,367
The purpose of which was to raise exactly this question

183
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,671
Of what a painting is or is it

184
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
Facebook

185
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
Depends

186
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:37,119
And that's when the negative opinions of who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3

187
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
We're taking

188
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
To a whole new level

189
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
At the time Barbara was an art school

190
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Somehow in the

191
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
Corridors of the school

192
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
People

193
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
Whispers

194
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,223
How did you hear it's something happened at the State Museum

195
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,271
You couldn't really verify it

196
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,855
I was on my way to the state museum for meeting

197
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
Patrick cincotta an artist and educator

198
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,231
Walked into the stator like that afternoon

199
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:08,863
Once there she headed to the gallery where who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3

200
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Was hanging

201
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
And then I

202
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,471
Came up on bedroom and there

203
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,335
I saw Jesus painting of Justice shorts

204
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
In attendance in the corner

205
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
Too petrified to move

206
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
The painting

207
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Had just been attacked

208
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
And the man who did this

209
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
Set on the bench

210
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,927
The tall brown-haired man sitting quietly on the bench

211
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
Add stab the painting with a box cutter

212
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:41,631
Tracing a series of long slashes to the very center of the campus

213
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Physicals in long long

214
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
Horizontal

215
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,775
The canvas had lost its tension

216
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
Sad

217
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
Turning the cuts

218
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,615
In a lopsided smile

219
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
And exposing the white wall behind

220
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,223
Patrick took it all in

221
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,039
And I saw this is a blink

222
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
Lands End

223
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,647
She went to find the Museum's curator

224
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,975
And I scream the painting is destroyed

225
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,583
It's murder

226
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,143
I remember I got a cold

227
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
Weekend

228
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
And I was at home

229
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,847
Ice Brown's Humulin is an art conservation expert in the Netherlands

230
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
And even though he didn't work at the

231
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
State Electric

232
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
He was called in that day

233
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
Along with the police

234
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,783
The director was there and

235
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
That lot of people wear

236
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Around Italy

237
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
20 people are around in there

238
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
It was a lot of

239
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Tension

240
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,975
The painting was laid out

241
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
In the middle of the gallery

242
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
They had it on the ground already

243
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
Face down

244
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,143
Could you see the slashes

245
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Yes

246
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
The flashes when added up together

247
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,775
Measured nearly 50 ft long

248
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,103
Petra and Ice brand couldn't quite believe it

249
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
That's all I remember of the day

250
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,687
The show

251
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
Awful

252
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,831
The attackers name was here art Ian Van vlaanderen

253
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
Why did he do it

254
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
I did ask him

255
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,071
He was 31 unemployed living with his parents

256
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,143
He was a painter himself although not very

257
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
Barbara looked into his past

258
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,007
I haven't seen his is

259
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,127
Before he is sex offender

260
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
But I know that

261
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Is

262
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Action

263
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
What's regarded by him

264
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
Autistic

265
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Gesture

266
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:42,719
Modern came from the school of thought that valued things like Landscapes and figures

267
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,023
He hated abstract art

268
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
Installed the painting is a kind of

269
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
Cultural provocation

270
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,167
One of the main arguments

271
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,519
His lawyer made in his defense

272
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
Was that

273
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
The provocation that the work inevitably

274
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,967
Cold for an action and

275
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Goswami

276
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,111
Even as one blotter and was being sentenced

277
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
The five months

278
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
In prison

279
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
He stood by his action

280
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
As a defense of artistic value

281
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,071
Many people in the Netherlands agreed

282
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
They sent letters

283
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Do the state elect

284
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,727
This so-called vandals should be made the director of modern museum

285
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Red one

286
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,567
He did what hundreds of thousands of us would have liked

287
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
To do read another

288
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,967
Do you think that this painting was designed to upset people

289
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,783
That's an interesting question

290
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
I think

291
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
The provocation was not

292
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
The first intention of the work

293
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,255
But I do think that a title like that

294
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
Because it's a question

295
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
Dammam

296
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
An answer

297
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
The painting was meant to challenge you

298
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
Although by all accounts

299
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,495
Newman who died in 1970

300
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
Would have been

301
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
Horrified by what happened

302
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,199
Well then bladder and sat in prison the canvas of who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3

303
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:13,599
Remained in tatters ice Browns and other experts wondered if it could be restored

304
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
Their initial prognosis was grim

305
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,303
Old paintings damage paintings can be treated

306
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:27,679
But you don't know what the results will be and in this case of course I

307
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
Realized it

308
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,519
This would be an enormous job

309
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,567
Or maybe an impossible job

310
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,175
These things look like anybody could do it that's not the case it's not

311
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:45,087
Carol mancusi ungaro from the Whitney Museum is one of the leading experts in the field of art conservation

312
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,903
The terminology in America is conservation

313
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
Not restoration

314
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
Okay good to know

315
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
Carol has Pioneer technique

316
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,607
Thanks for restoring work by modern and contemporary artists

317
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
She's worked on several paintings

318
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
By Barnett Newman

319
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,263
I've been in this business for a long time 40 years

320
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Dali

321
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
She says

322
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,639
That there are set rules that conservators must follow

323
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,175
When repairing a painting

324
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,759
Irreversibility is a cardinal rule of conservation

325
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,343
We make every effort to not use any material that

326
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
That cannot be

327
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Removed

328
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
Or reverse

329
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
In the future

330
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
For example if

331
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
Conservators add paint to a canvas

332
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
They want to make sure that

333
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
Paint can be dissolved

334
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
And removed later

335
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,239
They do this in case the artwork needs to be retouched again in the future

336
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:39,359
Conservators also try to preserve as much of the original material as possible

337
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,175
Touching only the areas that need treatment

338
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
And

339
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
They really study the yard

340
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
And look at their past work

341
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
In order to get a sense of what the artist was

342
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Just trying to achieve

343
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
With these rules in mind

344
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,231
The state elect phoned up practically every conservator in Europe

345
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,839
As they tried to figure out how to repair who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3

346
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
And it's 50 Ft worth

347
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
The slashes

348
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,703
Bee Health conferences with the best

349
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,775
People in the business

350
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,615
They couldn't really agree on what was the

351
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
Best way to do it

352
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:20,063
The biggest challenge perhaps counterintuitively was the very Simplicity of the painting

353
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,647
The busy texture and detail of a Picasso or Rembrandt

354
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,951
Often helps mask the repair work

355
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,047
But Newman's canvas was mostly just one big swath of uniform color

356
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,143
Any sign of repair however minor should be sure to stand out

357
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,239
Most conservators were too scared to try

358
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,335
Nobody wanted to burn their hands on it

359
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
As we say

360
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
But someone

361
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Finally came to the rescue

362
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,039
Daniel goldbriar was conservator based in New York

363
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,855
Who had worked with Newman while he was still alive

364
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,671
They approached him Daniel Gaul Trier

365
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
And asked whether he was

366
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
Sheets to do it

367
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,863
He was very optimistic he said he could mend it

368
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,167
98%

369
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,727
This is 98% restorable

370
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
I'm Daniel goldwire

371
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,895
Gold Buyer promised that when he was done the slashes would be virtually invisible

372
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,479
The officials at the state elect breathed a sigh of relief

373
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
And

374
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,319
In 1987 who's afraid of red yellow and blue

375
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
3 was rolled up

376
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,159
Put in a narrow coffin like box

377
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
And carried solemnly down the steps

378
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
Beijing Museum

379
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Then it was shipped off

380
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,815
The gold buyers studio in New York

381
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
From that time

382
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
The state liquor

383
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
Centier

384
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Much about it

385
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,519
Ghost Rider this is not a small job so please

386
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,335
Piano please leave me leave me

387
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
To do the job

388
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
A year pass

389
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
Mentoo

390
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Then three

391
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Eventually the museum is like

392
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
What's up with our painting

393
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:00,415
You should post it

394
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
Funway

395
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
4 1/2 years later

396
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Gold dryer

397
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
Unveil the painting

398
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
And when the museum director

399
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
A guy named Van Buren

400
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,287
Came to inspect his work

401
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,335
There was no sign of the flashes

402
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,127
The damage

403
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Having a race

404
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,967
Who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3

405
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Was headed

406
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,295
Back to Amsterdam

407
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,879
Shortly after its exhibited again

408
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
The Press

409
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,439
Is invited

410
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,791
Debater speaks of the return of lost son

411
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,863
Did try to make it a very festive

412
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
Precious Moments

413
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
But

414
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
First day back

415
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,495
Visitors the museum

416
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
Began to notice

417
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,359
To keep people from getting too close to the painting

418
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,431
The museum had installed a low fence

419
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,711
One guy there

420
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,015
A conservator if you didn't work for the museum

421
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
Decided The Hobbit

422
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,879
He really wants to smell

423
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,695
Piano notes not just look at it from a distance

424
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,999
The he looks

425
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
And he said

426
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,119
What's ISO before

427
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,423
This is this is something else

428
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,239
Ice brand was there that day too

429
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
I immediately recognized it

430
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
It was like a wool

431
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
Milotic paintball

432
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
You know Dell

433
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
No tension

434
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,039
Yes the slashes had been repaired and yes the surface was still red

435
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
But before there had been depth

436
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
To the ride

437
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
Shimmering wall

438
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
That was all gone

439
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
How did you feel

440
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,559
Incredibly disappointed

441
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
End

442
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
About set

443
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Fairies

444
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Very sad

445
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
Did you feel like the painting had been ruined

446
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
Yahoo

447
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
At first

448
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
The museum tried to deny it

449
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,247
The director was like what are you talkin about it looks good as new

450
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
But everybody else was like

451
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
Dude come on

452
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,903
The city council of Amsterdam which on the museum in

453
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
Technically on the painting

454
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
Sent it to a forensic lab

455
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,279
How to figure out what goal dryer I done

456
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,071
In the lab

457
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
They

458
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,887
Made cross-sections

459
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
The layers

460
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Because

461
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Usually

462
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,543
A painting especially in oil painting

463
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,079
It's not one layer

464
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
Many different layers

465
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
Like the layers in the ground you know like archaeologists uses layers in the ground so you see all the paint layers and then

466
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,599
They took these tiny sample

467
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,647
From the red part of the painting

468
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,951
And compare them to earlier sample

469
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:47,583
Olsat icebrand and the other has had pulled off the gallery floor the day the painting was slashed

470
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
And then it was

471
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
Very

472
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
Very very clear

473
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
That

474
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
Four layers of

475
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,031
Paint on top of your original one

476
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:01,919
And the four layers of new flat dull paint didn't just cover the areas that have been slashed

477
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,759
Gold wire had painted over the entire red part of the Canada

478
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,295
Basically

479
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
The whole painting

480
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,647
And Gold dryer hadn't used oil pan

481
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,439
Which is what Newman have used

482
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,791
He'd use a type of acrylic paint known as Al-Qaeda

483
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
What you use for house pay

484
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
House paint

485
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
Destroys

486
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,727
Is house paint very hard in

487
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,263
In 10 years

488
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,055
It becomes very hard and very

489
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,847
Impossible actually 2

490
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
Takeoff

491
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,407
And that's not all

492
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,807
There were also splatters of red paint on the blue and yellow Zips at either side of the canvas

493
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
Which indicated

494
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,927
That gold Rider had used a paint roller

495
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,791
Gold dryer had rolled over the entire canvas

496
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,095
Of a 20th century masterpiece

497
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
With house paint

498
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,959
Who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3

499
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Have been murdered

500
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
Again

501
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,895
Theories abound as to what went wrong in that Long Island Studio

502
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,223
Maybe goldwire bluffed his way into the job

503
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,551
Realized it was a nearly impossible task

504
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
And panic

505
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,647
Not everyone felt he'd ruin the painting

506
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:21,024
Barnett Newman's Widow for instance. He did a good job although she hadn't seen it in good lighting

507
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Publicly

508
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,376
Gold Rider insisted he hadn't painted over the camper

509
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,752
He said he had pinpointed the damaged area with 2 million tiny.

510
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,568
He said I did not owe her by this painting

511
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
That was

512
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
Really alive

513
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,920
We got we could prove it

514
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Even though

515
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
They just proving all this

516
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,040
The state Alec was in a bind

517
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,392
Because the Museum's director had signed off on the restoration

518
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,696
Gold Rider suit for defamation

519
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,488
And the museum settled

520
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,328
The whole Affair cost over a million bucks and

521
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
To this day

522
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,400
They're stuck with a damaged painting

523
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
And I can't really talk about that damage that was part of the settlement

524
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
But for

525
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
In 1997

526
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,176
11 years after the flashing

527
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,480
Bun bladder in the slasher

528
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:17,088
Found out about the botched restoration of who's afraid of red yellow and blue

529
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:22,208
3 apparently he to believe that the painting had been robbed of its original Power

530
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
Even if you hated it

531
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
So we called the museum

532
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
He was put through to the new director

533
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,912
A man named Rudy Foo

534
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Fuchs

535
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,984
Recorded the call

536
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,544
The attacker tells

537
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
Fuchs

538
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
That's

539
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,152
What he did in 1986

540
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,688
He would do that again

541
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
To restore

542
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,368
Should I cut it up again the slasher ass

543
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,440
Obviously not

544
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,024
But it's been totally.

545
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
The Flasher says

546
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
That's your opinion

547
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Suspects

548
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,680
It's quiet

549
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,984
And he's

550
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,288
Apparently thinking about

551
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
About that

552
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,104
Then he says

553
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
Okay okay

554
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,688
I know now what to do

555
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
36 answers

556
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,672
Well I wouldn't do what you think you have to do

557
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
And then

558
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,304
Conversation

559
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:35,168
After this phone call from bladder and returns to the museum

560
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,472
He enters unrecognized

561
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,008
He looks around

562
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,568
Whos afraid of red yellow and blue 3

563
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,384
But the painting is not on display

564
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
Essence moments

565
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,480
We came to the museum with fairy

566
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,296
Clear intentions

567
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,600
It must be hard for him not to

568
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Find

569
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
That work

570
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:59,232
So instead he goes and finds another painting by Barnett Newman

571
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
A large Blue painting

572
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,560
The white ZIP down the middle

573
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,840
Call Cathedral

574
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,936
That's another moment in my life I I will never forget

575
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,008
3D fix the Museum's director

576
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,568
Call Carol mancusi-ungaro

577
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
Right after it happened

578
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,248
You know it was a phone call for me to fix directress Kadlec that was a big deal so I immediately went to my office to take the phone call

579
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,040
And

580
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
He told me

581
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:28,672
That Cathedral been slashed and I swear the hair on my arms just to die

582
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,720
I could not believe

583
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,280
But it happened and it was the same person

584
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,328
For the second time

585
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,400
Here are Ian Van vlaanderen at attack

586
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,448
A Barnett Newman painting with a knife

587
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,032
When he was done he threw a packet of pamphlets on the

588
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,360
Floor that contained rambling incoherent writing

589
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,176
The others that aspect of it was

590
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,248
The slash marks where exactly the same

591
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
They were so

592
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,088
Similar to the earlier attack

593
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,136
That it became known as the artist signature

594
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
The flashers

595
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
Signature

596
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
At his second trial

597
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,840
Lateran was declared mentally unfit

598
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,656
And sent to a psychiatric Institution

599
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,752
Aaron's attacks may have been motivated by mental illness

600
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,544
But in the era of public art

601
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,616
They're part of a long sad history of vandalism

602
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
Picasso's Guernica was spray paint

603
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
It's in the 70s

604
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,992
Acid has been thrown at Rembrandt

605
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,320
2 Michelangelo sculptures have been attacked with hammer

606
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
Newman's work in particular

607
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,928
Has been vandalized multiple times

608
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,720
And these weren't artistic

609
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Stick gestures

610
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,048
Remember Newman's a Jewish artist

611
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,424
Who's afraid of red yellow and blue for the sequel to who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3

612
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,728
Was struck and spat upon in Germany

613
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
Because the attacker

614
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,104
Merced it bore a mocking resemblance to the German flag

615
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:57,248
A Newman sculpture at a museum in Houston with spray painted with swastikas in 1979

616
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
And just last year

617
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,600
Someone poured white paint into the reflecting pool

618
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,392
Surrounding the same sculpture

619
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,464
And left behind white supremacist leaflet

620
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,000
If you're keeping track

621
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:12,352
That's for Barnett Newman Works Too Faced a total of 5 times

622
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,936
6 if you include Daniel gold buyers botched restoration

623
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,240
And those are just the ones we know of

624
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,312
The Barnett Newman Foundation refused to

625
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,616
Speak to me for the story because

626
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,456
They have a really legitimate fear of CopyCat vandalism

627
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
Sure

628
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:33,088
I think that's right and it and you know maybe I shouldn't have agreed to talk to you for that reason

629
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,416
I am concerned now I hadn't thought about it

630
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,744
Myself Carol almost made a break for it during our interview

631
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
I have to ask you a question

632
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,120
How would you feel if after reading this Somebody went / 2 painting

633
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
I would feel terrible

634
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,008
And that would mean that we need me

635
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
I know

636
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,688
Because our paintings are so vulnerable

637
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
You're just out there and galleries

638
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:07,904
Come here at MoMA the Museum of Modern Art in New York

639
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,744
It's a Friday night it's really busy in here

640
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
When I was at MoMA recently

641
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,168
I saw this Barnett Newman painting titled vir heroicus sublimis

642
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:24,800
The title of the painting translates to man heroic and Sublime

643
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,104
It was the size of a billboard

644
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:31,968
It looks a lot like who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3 it's like red

645
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:36,320
With a couple of streaks of like is purplish color

646
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,368
In orange color

647
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
And has whitish color

648
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:44,000
But mostly read mostly

649
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:50,400
She usually read like this one solid wall of red

650
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,984
The painting didn't provoke me

651
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
To make me angry

652
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Like it did so many others

653
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,384
And it didn't look simple either like something you could just

654
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,432
Roll over with a paint roller

655
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
It was towering

656
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,504
Impressive

657
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Dance

658
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:09,600
You just get up close this thing you really get lost in it

659
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
For a moment

660
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,208
I think I felt this

661
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
Feeling

662
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,536
That I heard ice brand talk about

663
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
Something

664
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,632
That Newman tried to achieve in his work

665
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,448
Test do with the sublime

666
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,520
And a Subaru experience

667
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
When you are

668
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
Alone

669
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
In the desert

670
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
In the night and you

671
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
Co-lessee

672
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
Yunnan

673
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
Enormous

674
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
Describe

675
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,760
Are you feel

676
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,040
Very tiny

677
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
If you're overwhelmed by

678
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
This is a kind of

679
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,928
Feeling everybody knows I think

680
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:51,840
This is really overwhelming to be honest

681
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,960
The painting is more than just a painting

682
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,776
It's more than the material send the technique

683
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,056
It's the feeling

684
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,848
It evokes in you the viewer

685
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,944
And when you damage or destroy a piece of art

686
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
That's what you lose

687
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,040
That's the crime that's the real crime

688
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,600
Diminishing the paintings power

689
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
Yes

690
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,672
Experience

691
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,000
After cathedral was attacked

692
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,584
Both ice bronze and Carol advised on its restoration

693
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,400
Mmuseumm spared no expense

694
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
The canvas was stitched together with

695
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Surgical steel

696
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,776
Teachers and orthodontic wire

697
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,568
On a specially-built table

698
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,128
For painstaking years later

699
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
It was unveiled

700
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
It's not perfect

701
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,016
If you know where to look and look closely you can see the scars

702
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
But the impression

703
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
Survives

704
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,392
The painting can still take your breath away

705
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,488
Cathedra is currently on display at the state elect

706
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,816
But not who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3

707
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,352
It's a painting that

708
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:01,472
That is very close to everyone's heart at the Museum and in Amsterdam

709
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
Yet

710
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,800
We do all agree now

711
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
That it's not

712
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
What are used to be

713
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,664
The painting is sitting in a storage facility

714
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,944
At the edge of town

715
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,736
It's too big to fit

716
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
Into the normal

717
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,320
Places that are reserved

718
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,392
So it stands by itself

719
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,208
Kind of lonely

720
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Against the wall

721
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
There

722
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:31,168
Hoping for a day when future conservators might be able to undo what was done to it

723
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,472
The layers of paint

724
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,032
And get to the original experience

725
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
The one the artist created

726
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,616
Still sleeping

727
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
Underneath

728
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:01,632
Delta CEO talks to me more about the coolest job in the world. After this

729
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,112
Between the beats

730
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,416
Bongs and chatter of our devices

731
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,000
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

732
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
If

733
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,424
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

734
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,312
Technology talk to us

735
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,360
It is a creation of Sonic trap

736
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,432
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

737
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,016
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

738
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
To make them more human

739
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
Turn the living room lights on

740
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
Okay

741
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,744
Dim the living room lights to 50

742
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
2%

743
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
Okay

744
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:08,704
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

745
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,520
Makes for a much more natural experience

746
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,568
Turn the living room lights on

747
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
Dim the living room lights

748
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
50%

749
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:25,088
Representing two special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

750
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,904
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

751
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,464
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

752
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,584
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th right here on the 9th 9 p.m.

753
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,704
While he was working on this story a reporter jonatha seal

754
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,496
Really fell in love

755
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
With art conservation

756
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:49,664
There was a point in every conversation that I had with a conservator while working on the story

757
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
Where

758
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
I'd be like

759
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:56,576
This is the coolest job like there is no better job than this

760
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,624
In fact you can hear

761
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,952
One of those moments in my interview with

762
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,256
Icebrand I think you have

763
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:08,608
Maybe the best job in the world sounds like a fantastic profession

764
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
Daily I enjoy it

765
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,240
Why do you like it so much why were you so enthralled

766
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,824
Conservators are sort of this

767
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,152
Hybrid of an artist or they would probably say an artist

768
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
Assistant

769
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,944
And one of those

770
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
Forensic scientist

771
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:29,088
From CSI you really have to think like an artist

772
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
To try to preserve

773
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,672
What is Carol says the artist was

774
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Trying to achieve

775
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:38,048
But their work and she actually spends a lot of her time interviewing living artist

776
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
When she's restoring their work

777
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,424
She's built an archive of these interviews you can access online

778
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,984
Call the artist documentation program

779
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,288
And if they're just audio recordings of her

780
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,080
Interviewing artists about their process

781
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:56,480
But in addition to getting inside the mind of the artist you have to know chemistry and all this hard science stuff

782
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,808
About the composition of materials that artists use

783
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,600
And there's some really far out

784
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
Technology that

785
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,160
That they employ

786
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,440
And they're able to work

787
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Miracle

788
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,512
In what kind of Technology are we talking about

789
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
Let's start with imaging technique

790
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:16,960
Like Photography they have technology that allows them to see below the surface of the paint

791
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:23,360
Like the layers underneath the painting that is brown talked about in the story

792
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,688
Read reflect ography and I can get too technical on you they also

793
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
Bring

794
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,992
Painting

795
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:35,392
To hospitals to have them x-rayed and that's not the only way this field overlaps with medicine actually the cancer

796
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,952
Servitors who stitched cathedra together

797
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,768
In the Netherlands they were actually trained at the hospital

798
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,096
To do that I talk to another conservator who had been a pre-med

799
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,400
Student before going into this field

800
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:52,032
So that they're able to see below the surface of the painting using special types of Photography and end

801
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
Plano x-rays

802
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,104
They're also able to determine what

803
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
Elements

804
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,456
Are in the painting like in the paint layers

805
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:04,064
So they have this thing it's like it sort of looks like a grocery store scanner and they can

806
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,648
All over the painting and it'll identify the element

807
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,952
It's like choosing cures Cobalt

808
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,744
They can basically map

809
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
The the

810
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,536
Surface of

811
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
The painting

812
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
Down to the atom

813
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
Intrinsic

814
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,656
Of the elements that are there

815
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,728
They're also able to see

816
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,032
To how the painting

817
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,568
Will fade over time

818
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:30,432
They have these tools that can measure an artwork sensitivity to light

819
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
And project

820
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,992
How it will fade

821
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
They can only

822
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
See under the surface of the

823
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,624
Really inside the pain

824
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,928
Taking off to see into the future

825
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
That painting

826
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
Wow

827
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
That's so cool

828
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
How do you use that information when you're trying to conserve a painting

829
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,376
So you can determine how much light it can be

830
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,424
Supposed to like for instance

831
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,032
If you have a painting that is especially light-sensitive you wouldn't know not to

832
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,568
Play sit like maybe in

833
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,152
Like a bright lights of a main hall or maybe design special lighting

834
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,432
So that

835
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
It doesn't

836
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
Fade the painting fast

837
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
Oh so they're like

838
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,344
Trying to save a painting before it needs to be saved

839
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,416
Deception method right trying to save a painting before it needs

840
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Mitsubishi

841
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,232
So in the case of this story

842
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
Whirlpool dryer

843
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,352
Applied a bunch of this red paint in effort

844
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,120
2

845
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:24,704
You fix the painting which allowed people ejected to

846
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,752
How would you go about removing

847
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
Paint

848
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,336
From a painting without removing all the pay

849
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,920
Chick-fil-A painting if you really wanted to to put it back to where it originally was

850
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:38,016
So very carefully

851
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:41,856
Bet there's a couple different ways they remove stuff from the surface of of

852
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
Of artworks

853
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
That's an added there that they don't

854
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
Like

855
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,000
They use emulsions and gels

856
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,536
That dissolve

857
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:56,192
Material added to the surface of the artwork but these are gels are like kind of discus you know it's not so it's not

858
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,472
Liquid it doesn't run

859
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,544
And they're able to keep it really contain

860
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,104
They also use the stuff

861
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,688
I don't think it's been used a lot but it's probably the coolest thing I've

862
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,992
Heard about wealth while researching the story

863
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,528
They use atomic

864
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:15,392
Oxygen what I'm about to say doesn't make sense but it's literally oxygen from space

865
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:21,792
It's it's an elemental form of oxygen that does not exist in the Earth's atmosphere.

866
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,584
You only find it in low earth orbit

867
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,912
This technology is actually developed by NASA because

868
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:32,032
Atomic oxygen is like they were sending corrosion on satellites in the international

869
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
Space Station

870
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:37,152
They basically either use like a an airbrush and like

871
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,200
Had it very close to paint where they put

872
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,272
The piece of art in a vacuum chamber and pump in the stuff

873
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,576
It's really good for removing

874
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,392
From fire damaged

875
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,184
Paintings that you can actually see

876
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
Some photos online

877
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,024
Obtaining save restored

878
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,816
That have been in fires

879
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,144
And it's pretty mind-blowing actual

880
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,704
Like a before-and-after like you have a picture

881
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,008
Black and ruined painting

882
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,824
And on the other you got a completely Lycra

883
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,592
Restored work

884
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:11,712
The atomic oxygen was always used to most famously to restore this painting

885
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,016
By Andy Warhol called bathtub

886
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,040
The painting of a

887
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
Bathtub

888
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:21,696
Somebody at a party at the Museum had a had kissed it so there was a lipstick mark on it

889
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,024
They were able to remove it using Atomic oxygen

890
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,840
In all these cases you know

891
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,656
Conservatives had basically given up hope

892
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,424
On this painting

893
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,472
They're like these are never going to

894
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,288
So with all this new technology

895
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
Is it possible

896
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,104
They could go back

897
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
2

898
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,968
Yeah really restore who's afraid of red yellow and blue

899
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
Number three

900
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,528
The way that

901
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,576
You would feel really want to do lyrics

902
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
Yeso

903
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,440
The answer is Maybe

904
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:59,584
Near the end of my reporting I talk to a journalist in the Netherlands

905
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,168
Hood written a book on the state of like his name was Ian lemures great

906
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Resource

907
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,520
In a couple years ago he was able to get the full results

908
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,312
From the forensic lab

909
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,128
Analysis of who's afraid of red yellow and blue 3

910
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,152
The one that had

911
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,688
Determine that goal dryer

912
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,224
Had over painted it

913
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,784
So he was able to get the full thing released

914
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,600
And what the report showed according to him

915
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:25,184
Was that gold Rider had use several layers of varnish

916
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
Which is like this clear

917
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,072
Can I like a resin that he'd use several layers of varnish

918
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,888
Before painting over the canvas of theoretically

919
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,680
Because he did that

920
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
The layers of paint

921
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
Above the varnish

922
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,264
Could be removed

923
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,056
So it is possible

924
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:47,456
Yeah maybe not right now but it is possible I talked to Carol mancusi-ungaro from the Whitney about this and she kind

925
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,224
I never agreed

926
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
I don't know

927
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,296
I don't know I dunno

928
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
That

929
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,624
I've seen my profession grow

930
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,952
And our ability to do things that one time we couldn't do

931
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,488
I

932
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
Believe

933
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,584
That there may be

934
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,864
Procedures

935
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,912
That we can do in the future

936
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,704
That might be able to reverse
