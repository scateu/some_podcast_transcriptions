I'm Roman Mars

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,160
When designing a commercial structure

36
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,560
The architect must make the hallways wide enough for wheelchair the materials must be compatible with its surrounding climate

37
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,144
The beams must be able to support the building and withstand the wind

38
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,704
The building should be

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Interesting

40
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
Comfortable

41
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,824
And to be completely abandoned

42
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:59,552
There are a number of considerations for how a building should respond to emergency

43
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Horns

00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600

48

Frequency of the light the intensity of the light

00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Smoked dampening

50
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,608
There's a sprinkler stepanek bars

51
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,192
Spring loaded horizontal bar that you push to unlock emergency exit

52
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
Does smoke detectors

53
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,544
What kind do you use and the distances between them

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
You know a lot of people

55
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Harley Vin lookup

56
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,176
And see these things in and they just need to be there

57
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
When an emergency happens

58
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,368
Now Adam line again Daniel Scoville or Architects we work with them that arcsin in beautiful Downtown Oakland California

59
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Most of the time when they're working on fire safety they'll consult experts about where to place what kinds of architectural

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
Call emergency devices

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
But there's one safety device

62
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
I spent a month design

63
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
Right into the building from the get-go

64
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
It's impossible

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
To ignore

66
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,824
Torrid store locations that's pretty important right from the start because it changes the whole dynamic of

67
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,896
Typically buildings required to fire stairs

68
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,968
But it all depends on the size and purpose of the structure

69
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:05,600
In architecture and building codes do you always need a certain number of exits or means of egress

70
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
What's the ways out of a building

71
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
And

72
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
This fire escape

73
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
Precariously

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
Bolted to the side of the building is

75
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,816
Is one of our means of egress out of the space

76
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,400
This is how 99percentinvisible is going to escape a burning building

77
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:22,752
This is how I work sign and 99percentinvisible

78
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,408
In case of fire Architects Daniel Scoville and Adam Wayne a game producer Avery compliment would put their Steely resolve

79
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,552
Athletic prowess to The Test Escape right outside of our window

80
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
And I thought it was defense

81
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
It's all rusty and stuff

82
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,024
But then I bothered to read the sign with the evacuation plan for our building

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,328
Fire escapes are not allowed in Newquay

84
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Construction

85
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
But because we are at a beautiful old brick building

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,776
The fire escape is actually one of our means of egress we just speak of

87
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,128
Means of egress thinking of the whole route

88
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
The Carter

89
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
And the stairs

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,016
And you think of an exit as being essentially

91
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,320
The door Professor Sara wermiel

92
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
Independent scholar and researcher

93
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
MIT

94
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
One of my

95
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,232
Books is called the fireproof building

96
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,071
I can't remember the subtitle

97
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,863
It's the fireproof building

98
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,447
Technology and Public Safety in the 19th century American city

99
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,775
The single most dangerous thing for architecture

100
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Historically

101
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
Is fire

102
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
And in the 1700s

103
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
The fire did break out

104
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
There wasn't a whole lot you could do about it

105
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,295
But that time there were firefighters loudly

106
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,599
And they would come and it would bring you

107
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
The fire stick

108
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,695
It was a cart with a ladder on it

109
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
That was actually what

110
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,815
The earliest fire escapes were

111
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,655
So fire escape method started to get Incorporated in the architecture

112
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
Starting with the scuttle

113
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,567
It look like a skylight it would have some kind of cover would like a trapdoor

114
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
On the roof

115
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
And then there'd be a ladder

116
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
To to get up

117
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
And out and sew in a fire

118
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:13,087
You would climb through the Scuttle out onto the rooftop to your neighbor's cattle and crawl into their building

119
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,391
Which presumably hadn't also caught fire

120
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,255
That was the beginning this idea that a city could require something

121
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,303
For the sake of fire safety

122
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,375
Around 1860 New York begin to record

123
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
Choir means of egress

124
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
In tenement building

125
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Turn that buildings were tall

126
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,799
Flammable densely-packed tinderboxes just

127
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,151
Pull up families of course landlord went with the least expensive option

128
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
The popular cheap fix

129
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Was rope

130
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
Ropes with baskets

131
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,135
That you're supposed to somehow you know the building's on fire

132
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:52,255
You have your kid you're terrified and you calmly it'll open this this

133
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Little

134
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
Nightstand

135
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,631
Pull out the basket with the ropes

136
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,215
You know set up the apparatus strap yourself in

137
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,591
And somehow you know lower yourself calmly to the ground you know what's it's just preposterous

138
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,663
30 hilarious old advertisements for fake cabinets

139
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,479
Holler frigerators an empty washing machines

140
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,879
So that you can store your ropes and basket apparatus because no one would notice that extra washing machine

141
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:25,279
One engineer actually thought that instead of dispatching ropes from inside archers could shoot the ropes up

142
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
To the higher floors

143
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
You know people aren't

144
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,655
That athletic necessarily to begin with but

145
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
Second of all

146
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
It's a fire

147
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,823
You know this isn't the best time to eat a like figure out

148
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,127
How to lower yourself on a rope

149
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,199
Another patent proposed individual parachute

150
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,759
That's with a company in rubber shoes to break the fall

151
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
They're also these

152
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
Big slide fire escapes

153
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,927
That were largely marketed to schools as both emergency devices

154
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
And playground equipment

155
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:59,839
They're actually used to be a giant spiral slide to Escape The Claremont Hotel right here in Oakland

156
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Which

157
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,703
Would have made that place a whole lot better lots of ideas

158
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,263
But by the 1870s

159
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
Fire escapes begin becoming

160
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
Something iron something fixed

161
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
Out of the building

162
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,247
Although by that point they still weren't anything great

163
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
They were

164
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,087
Like a iron platform outside of a window

165
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
With straight ladders attached

166
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,975
Or it might just be a straight ladder clamp to the wall

167
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
In some cities the external ladders

168
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
Angled and widen to become more like stairs

169
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
This was an improvement

170
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:39,519
But ultimately fire escapes just didn't suffice a terrible tragedy to show this

171
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
So the asch building

172
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
In New York

173
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
Was built as a locked building

174
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
And its owners

175
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
Representative as being

176
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,855
You know maybe for warehousing

177
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
Not necessarily for manufacturing

178
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,791
Based on its Dimensions the asch building was required to have three means of egress

179
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,143
But the developer insisted that the property would just be used as warehousing

180
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
Two rather than three stairs

181
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,239
He was allowed to put into stairs

182
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
And a thin fire escape

183
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,127
Then the owner rents the top three floors of the asch building

184
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
The Triangle Shirtwaist company

185
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
In March

186
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
19

187
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
11

188
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
There's a fire in the building

189
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
It's not know exactly how it begins

190
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
And it is

191
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
It spreads

192
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Quickly

193
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,279
The 10th floor has an exit to the roof

194
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:38,655
So many of the 10th floor workers are able to survive by taking the stairs up and

195
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
The workers on

196
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
The 8th floor

197
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
AR

198
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,847
By-and-large able to get out or we're trapped

199
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,687
The door to the stairs opened in word and became block with bodies

200
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
And the stairs

201
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,039
We're backed up with workers exiting from the floors below

202
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,111
The workers on the 94 couldn't even get down

203
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:04,255
Only a few workers on this floor new about the 10th floor exit and so they didn't even try to go upstairs

204
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,583
There was charged that one of the doors was locked

205
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,655
And this was approved at the trial

206
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
But

207
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,495
I believe even if it had been

208
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,335
With all the people exiting from the 8th floor

209
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,223
And the staircases were very narrow and winding there just wasn't the capacity

210
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
Some workers tried to use the outside fire escape

211
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
And it collapsed under the weight

212
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,719
It was from the windows of the ninth floor that many workers desperate to escape the flames and smoke

213
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
Fell or jumped to their deaths

214
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,327
146 people lost their lives

215
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
Right in the middle of Greenwich Village

216
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
There were a lot of witnesses

217
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
It was horrible

218
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
But the building

219
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Was fine

220
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,079
The asch building was a fireproof building

221
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,407
And of course it's it's still standing

222
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
And it's now part of

223
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,991
New York University

224
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,319
The asch building now called The Brown building was well-made

225
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Which is why at the time

226
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,903
No one really thought it needed an egress

227
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,231
Exit and egress were a problem people fought for the tenement

228
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,511
And the poor quality build

229
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:14,143
The logic was if a building was first class it was in and of itself say for the occupants

230
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,007
And then the people could just be safely locked inside of these non-combustible building

231
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,847
The triangle fire proves that architecture couldn't protect

232
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
We had to protect ourselves

233
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
From Ark

234
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
This is when

235
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,807
An organization called the National Fire Protection Association

236
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
Does a lot of

237
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
Studies in thinking

238
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
You know about

239
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Egress

240
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
And goody Grace meant getting rid of fire escapes

241
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,023
For so many reasons

242
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
They weren't commonly used

243
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,631
So they were often out of order and states of disrepair

244
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,471
In Northern climates they were covered with snow or eroded by rain

245
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,799
And not everyone could access them like people with disabilities

246
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,103
And the very young and the elderly

247
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,943
And women who are hamstrung by the fashion of the time

248
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
Women in these long skirts

249
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,831
Might not have the presence of mind to take off their skirt could actually get out

250
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:10,463
Also fire escapes are scary using some narrow rickety staircases on really tall building

251
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
That make you feel like you should

252
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,815
Strap on rubber shoes in a parachute

253
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,423
And if people weren't used to using fire escapes they often didn't know where they were

254
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
People

255
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,007
Try to leave the way they came in you know that's

256
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
That's what they think

257
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
And that's where Modern fire escapes come in

258
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,639
They're not bolted to the side of the building

259
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
They are the logical place

260
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
Where you go in an emergency

261
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
They are the stairs

262
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,807
Well they look like normal stairs but

263
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Really

264
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
They're pieces of Emergency Equipment

265
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,463
Enclosed in fireproof walls and sealed with a self-closing door

266
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
I'm covered with sprinklers and alarms

267
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
And because

268
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
They

269
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,119
Work perfectly well as stairways

270
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
They're often

271
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
The stairway

272
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
In a building

273
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
So if the

274
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
The building won't have

275
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,055
The grand stairway any longer

276
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
It'll have

277
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
Lots of elevators

278
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
And

279
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
The fire stick

280
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,503
Goodbye opulent lobbies with sweeping grandstand

281
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:11,903
If you like to take the stairs you probably already bemoaned the fact that they are always shoved off into a tower

282
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,255
And are very cold and Industrial no matter what the building looks like from the outside

283
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
If we want we can make them look good but most clients

284
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,119
Alexa spending money on things that people are going to see me

285
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,935
Officemate an architect Adam line again

286
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,495
The stairways need to be what's called

287
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,823
Raided meaning that they need to be enclosed

288
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
Any type of construction that won't melt

289
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
Or a lot of Fire

290
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
To penetrate as quickly

291
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
As a non rated wall

292
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,831
These rated Towers can be like buildings within buildings

293
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
The prime example of a souped-up

294
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Fire stairway

295
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
Isn't Freedom Tower

296
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,535
The Freedom Tower which has this emergency Corps

297
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,375
Which is on its own separate electrical and plumbing system

298
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,447
It has its own elevators and stairs

299
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,519
That's a logic huge he's a professor at Wesleyan University

300
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
And I'm also a practicing architect

301
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,127
Can I run a small firm called periphery project

302
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,479
And part of that periphery involves doing research on architecture

303
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:13,087
He's particularly fascinated by these core structures around the fire stairs

304
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
And these emergency

305
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
The cores are modeled with software

306
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
End simulation

307
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Dedicated

308
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Egress

309
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,095
This program Exodus 4.0 I think there's nice

310
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
Is 5.0

311
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
Can simulate

312
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
How quickly

313
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,751
A floor of a building can be cleared

314
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,311
Based on the maximum number of bodies that

315
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,359
Would be allowed in the space

316
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
How quickly could those bodies

317
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
Exit this

318
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
So the architect

319
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
Or actually more likely the consultant

320
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,551
Will plug in the measurements of a building

321
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,111
All the information about its Emergency Equipment

322
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
The maximum number of occupy

323
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
And basically

324
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Play

325
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
And watch the digital people

326
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Escape the pics

327
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,607
A lot of agent-based modeling programs with humans

328
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,727
Don't work terribly well cuz he was doing necessarily behave predictably

329
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
But in emergencies they do

330
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,311
Given adequate signage

331
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,151
People will behave in predictable ways in the event of an emergency

332
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
So this makes sense

333
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
We've already established that in an emergency

334
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,063
People don't want to go places they haven't gone to before

335
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,623
Or use devices I've never seen

336
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,951
You know figure out if they can catch a rope shot at them with a bow and arrow

337
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,815
The way egress works now is in keeping with the way that we use buildings normally

338
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,887
Even though rated Towers take up a lot of space and money

339
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,447
And make for an unpleasant shopping experience

340
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
It's hard to argue with this solution

341
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
Is paid off let's say

342
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,823
Sarah again

343
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,359
2012

344
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
In nonresidential structures

345
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,711
There were 65 deaths

346
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
In the whole year

347
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
You don't probably more people struck by lightning

348
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,159
Usually 28 people were struck by lightning in 2012

349
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
But still

350
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,535
Even though each one is a tragedy 65 gas doesn't strike me as all that money

351
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,607
This number is already down from 2003

352
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,191
Where they work 220 des and on his eventual Bill Dance

353
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,263
So these are the buildings with heavy regulations in core structure

354
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,127
Modern Emergency Equipment in egress procedures are really helping to minimize the effects

355
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
The fire accident

356
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,455
But from an aesthetic standpoint it

357
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
Almost a pity

358
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
Because fire escapes are beautiful

359
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:25,183
And although I'm not really thrilled at the prospect of clamoring down the fire escape outside my window

360
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
I do like to look at it

361
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,559
Is there a fire escapes even the ones that are no longer in use

362
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
What is physical reminder

363
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
That we evolved past being a culture that says

364
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Here's a rope

365
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
Good luck buddy

366
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
I just like seeing them

367
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,567
And hope that

368
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
