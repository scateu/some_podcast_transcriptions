21
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
Hello friends

22
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
We have just 10 days before season 3

23
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,464
September 19th is the big day

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,304
The plan is a new episode every 9 days and Sam is here

25
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
Keeping us on task

26
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,656
And I really enjoy the new shows for working

27
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:49,568
In the meantime I literally have 10,000 tiny pocket size notebook samael staff to package and ship along with us.

Fantastic Kickstarter campaign that not complaining at all

31
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,272

34
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,488
I have a story from radio show that I've only recently started listening to

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
Just

36
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Great

37
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,840
It's called backstory with the American history

38
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:18,240
And it's the highly enjoyable show you don't even need a love history to enjoy it you just need to be

39
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,520
Curious about the

40
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
All around you

41
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,080
I like stories

42
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,128
About how it got that way which

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,224
What is the definition of history but the point is I think you're going to like

44
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,552
99percentinvisible is obsessed

45
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,880
With the things we build and what they say about us

46
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Usually

47
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
In directory

00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
Spruce Way

49
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
I'm drawn to Monument

50
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
Because

51
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
These are things we build that

52
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,072
Their Inception

53
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,424
Trying to tell you a story

54
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
Give a place

55
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
For a moment in time

56
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Difficult

57
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
Meaning

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
But that meaning that's fused

59
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Concrete

60
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Stone

61
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
Can be slanted hurtful bigoted

62
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
May be misguided or even miss under

63
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
Stud

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Anyway

65
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344
This is a story about a monument

66
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,392
But I couldn't get out of my head the first time I heard it

67
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
One of the host of Acts

68
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
Destroy the 19th

69
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
Century history guy at air

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
Is going to take it from here

71
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,144
The 1890s the first decade of twentieth-century.

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
Veterans in both the union and the Confederacy were

73
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
Dying often

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
Their sons and daughters

75
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
Notice that

76
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,872
They better acknowledge their enormous sacrifices and

77
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,200
Begin a kind of mania putting up monuments in

78
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,528
Towns and cities and Villages all across the country

79
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
And

80
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:40,416
Even into the early 1930s people were still trying to nail down all the meeting

81
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
Except it's complicated Civil War

82
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
My Memorial

83
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,560
And one place of the memorialization of the Civil War

84
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Was played out

85
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,656
Was it one of the places where the Civil War in some ways began

86
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Harpers Ferry

87
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
West Virginia

88
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,264
Where John Brown lettuce famous raid

89
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
It 1859

90
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,872
A band of white and black abolitionists

91
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Trying to

92
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
Inspire a slave rebellion

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
Today there are two monuments there

94
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
1 is a 6

95
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
Split tall obelisk

96
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,600
How looks like a miniature Washington Monument

97
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,696
And that Monument marks the original location of the old Federal Armory

98
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
That was so important in John Brown's raid

99
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
Today

100
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Across the street

101
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
Maybe a hundred feet away

102
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,423
Up against the side of a large brick building is another Memorial

103
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,239
And that one looks like a big Tombstone frankly

104
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
About the size

105
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
A refrigerator

106
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
It's a large

107
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Granite and

108
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
Ascribed

109
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
Monument

110
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
This is Todd Bolton

111
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
He works the National Park Service at Harvest

112
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,295
To buy producers Eric mental nailpassion Stein

113
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,343
Talk to him when they visited the town

114
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,671
And the mind that he's describing was dedicated 1931

115
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,999
In honor of the first person killed in John Brown's raid

116
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,303
A man by the name of Hayward Shepherd

117
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,607
There's no images on it no

118
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,911
No bronze it's it's it's

119
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
It's text

120
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,495
N64 Maybe

121
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
Space Halsey wear

122
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
That's in good shape

123
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
It's it really is

124
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
Rackaracka

125
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
Pretty good shape

126
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
The interesting thing about Heyward Shepherd

127
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
Is it just that he was the first

128
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Person killed by Brown and his Raiders

129
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
Is a Hayward Shepherd was African-American

130
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Free black

131
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,743
A fact that has made this Memorial more than a little problematic over the

132
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
Eric and Nell

133
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
Tell story

134
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,887
Hayward Sheppard work as a porter for the B&O Railroad in Harpers Ferry

135
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
He was on duty the night of October 9th

136
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
1859

137
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
The night of John Brown's raid

138
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
Aware of a commotion outside

139
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
Shepherd took his Lantern and walk down to the train

140
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
Browning Company were on their way into town

141
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
It was dark

142
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
And Shepard was in their path

143
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,551
Either Brown himself or one of his men shot Shepherd

144
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
Leaving him badly injured

145
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
He died shortly after

146
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
No

147
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,999
Hayward Shepherds name might have been forgotten had it not been for the efforts

148
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
F2 group

149
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
United Daughters of the Confederacy

150
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
And the Sons of Confederate Veterans

151
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
The UTC and the SCV

152
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
They're run by the Descendants

153
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,311
Confederate soldiers and their job is to preserve Confederate heritage

154
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
Memorials Flags archives

155
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
That kind of

156
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,943
In 1931

157
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,831
The local chapters of the UDC and the SCV erected of Memorial Hayward Shepherd in Harpers Ferry

158
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,671
They placed it directly across the street from the John Brown obelisk

159
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
In one long sentence

160
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
The memorial reads

161
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,399
This folder is set up by the Sons of Confederate Veterans in the united Daughters of the Confederacy

162
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
As a memorial to Hayward Shepherd

163
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,519
Exemplifying the character and faithfulness

164
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
Thousands of negroes

165
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Who

166
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,663
Under many Temptations throughout the subsequent years of war

167
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
So conducted themselves

168
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,759
The no stain was left upon a record

169
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,831
Which is the peculiar Heritage of the American people

170
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
And an everlasting tribute to the best

171
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
In bo3

172
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
Faces

173
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,255
Okay so to translate that from monuments p

174
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,863
We the SUV and the UTC would like to honor Heyward Shepherd

175
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
And all the other black people in the south

176
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,263
We're good and faithful to their white superiors never rebelling against them

177
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
Or the status quo

178
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
The group had a nickname for this Monument

179
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,151
The faithful slave Memorial

180
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,783
The faithful slave with an idea Confederate Heritage groups have been pushing for years

181
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,879
Logic was since most slaves didn't Rebelle

182
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
They must have been happy

183
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
And if they were happy

184
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
It's because their masters treated them well

185
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:33,887
Slaves were faithful because they knew slavery was better than any other situation available

186
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,495
Of course Hayward Shepherd wasn't a Slave

187
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,823
So even if there were such a thing as a faithful slave

188
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
Shepherd wouldn't fit the bill

189
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
But that was no matter

190
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,199
The monument was built in dedicated with

191
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,015
Plenty of fanfare and plenty of controversy

192
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,599
W e b Dubois called the dedication a quote

193
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
Pro-slavery celebration

194
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,303
For 40 years the monument stood undisturbed

195
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
During that time

196
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,447
National Park Service acquired a bunch of the land and artifacts in Harpers Ferry

197
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,031
Including the Heyward Shepherd Memorial and all the problems attached

198
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
Then in the 1970s

199
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,663
The Park Service began restoring some of the old buildings in

200
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,991
In order to keep the memorial from being damaged

201
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,831
They put it away in a maintenance yard or it stayed for 5 years

202
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,695
When they put it back in its original location they made one notable change

203
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
It was

204
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
All covered

205
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
With a wooden box

206
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
This is Elliot coming

207
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,679
Former commander of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in the nearby Maryland division

208
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,287
Remember the SUV is one of the two groups who originally funded the memorial

209
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
So needless to say

210
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
They were upset when they found out it had been covered

211
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Todd Bolton

212
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
The Park Service employee

213
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,759
Says he wasn't at the top level of Memorial discussion

214
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,831
But he had to send a voice certain decisions were being made

215
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,135
My understanding was the

216
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
There had been

217
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
The Park at

218
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,535
Threats of violence or defacing of the monument

219
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,607
So it stayed in and storage for a

220
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Some years

221
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:14,495
Guy in storage you mean covered or yours

222
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
The wooden box

223
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,591
With painted brown to make it blend in with

224
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Trash can

225
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
Again Elliott coming

226
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
So

227
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
Concern me.

228
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,039
Illegitimate monuments

229
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
National Park Service

230
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Covered up in

231
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
What kind of work from there

232
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,279
Annually 90s Cummings the Sons of Confederate Veterans member

233
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,071
Begin a letter writing campaign

234
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
To get the box removed

235
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
I worked with Bruce Babbitt who at the

236
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
Time was secretary

237
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
Bill Clinton

238
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
I wrote to Centerburg

239
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,591
Who was the senior senator from West

240
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
Virginia where harbin Springs located

241
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,503
In 1995 enough political pressure mounted to force the Park Service

242
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
To uncover the memorial

243
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,599
But they added a little something of Their Own

244
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,487
About 10 feet to the right of the memorial is a small interpretive plaque

245
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
Explaining who Hayward Shepherd was

246
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,119
And what's a 1931 controversy with all about

247
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,959
It also offers a quote from w e b Dubois

248
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Quote

249
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,335
Hear John Brown aimed human history a blow that woke a guilty Nation

250
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,151
With him fought seven slaves and Sons of

251
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,015
The quokkas on about John Brown but mentions neither Heyward Shepherd

252
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,063
Nor the idea of the faithful slave

253
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
That the other marker

254
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,903
Should have been more you know expanse

255
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
Because it really doesn't say it

256
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
Anything it just talks

257
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Survive

258
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
WV boy

259
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
That's all it does

260
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
This is Jim Tolbert

261
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,167
Former president of the West Virginia and AAC

262
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
CP

263
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,031
He said that he and other members of the n-double-acp or upset that

264
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,847
The plaque doesn't adequately debunk the faithful slave

265
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Or as he put

266
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
That

267
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Clearly a lie

268
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
I'll just keep on calling little eye

269
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Sly

270
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,623
MLB nwacp thought the plaque said to little

271
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,951
The Sons of Confederate Veterans were unhappy it was there at all

272
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
We're

273
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,535
Not happy that they felt the need to put

274
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
Ian Halperin

275
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Magnets

276
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
We feel the

277
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
Historical monument

278
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Stand on their own

279
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,751
That is our job our job is not to tell you to

280
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
You come here

281
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
And this is what you

282
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
We want you to think about this particular

283
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Part of History

284
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
We don't do that

285
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
RR jobs

286
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991

Yashow balanced perspective

288
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
And allow you as an individual

289
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Debased on that

290
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,231
Unbiased information to walk away with your own

291
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
With your own conclusion

292
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
Today

293
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,423
The n-double-acp is still pretty upset about the whole situation

294
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
But there's only so much they can do

295
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
The Confederate Heritage groups would get rid of the plaque in a heartbeat

296
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,359
But they more or less moved on

297
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,967
The Park Service maintains that the memorial is in historical artifact

298
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,015
Entrusted to the US government

299
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
And the continued to maintain it as such

300
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,951
The Hayward Sheppard Memorial may have just been a monument to a particular vision of the

301
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
But it does point to something else

302
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
Over the past 150 years

303
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,167
There's been little effort to memorialize slavery in a way that reflects

304
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
The true scale of the experience

305
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
And it's reverberations

306
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,895
What's clear is that slavery can't be stored in the maintenance yard or covered up with a plywood box

307
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,735
And one has to wonder if there will ever be an interpretive plaque

308
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
Big enough to make sense of it all

309
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,047

It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

333
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,551
Makes for a much more natural experience

334
