34

I'm Roman Mars

35
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,488
So many classic movies have been made in downtown Los Angeles

36
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,072
Even if they didn't take place in downtown Los Angeles

37
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,168
It's always fun when you watching a movie that take place in New York and you spot a palm tree

38
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,800
Palm trees are just one of the factors that a location scout has to worry about

39
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
Most films they really have to avoid them

40
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
It's at a cost

41
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,040
Lori Bolton is a location scout in LA

42
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,112
She's worked on Inception heat A River Runs Through It

43
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
Whole Lotta movie

44
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,488
She was the first ever location professional ever asked to join the academy

45
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,072
You're not the only one I am the only one the first and the only yeah

46
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,144
On location with Lori is producer Avery trufelman

47
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,448
Lawry's job is to find interesting

48
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,240
Plot conducive locations

49
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:24,896
Lots of them are frequently will show someone over a hundred different options for one location you know before they get a sense of what they

50
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:30,272
But Scouts also have to make sure that the locations they find are actually usable

51
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,880
So big part of Lawry's job is convincing Property Owners to say yes

52
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:41,536
Part would she is really really good at

53
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
I just want to show her

54
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
She's from Oak

55
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,728
Lori sweet-talked our way up to the top floor

56
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
City Hall

57
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,312
Up to a panoramic view of Los Angeles

58
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
Surf Great River

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,504
So you know Emily has its problems but I think any location person you talk to

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
Really proud of the city and the variety of locations and how much fun it is to dino drive around and discover

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Everything

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
From the top floor balcony

63
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,536
We could see the massive City unfurling around us

64
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,608
Emily pointed out all of her favorite location

65
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,424
There's so much variety here it's amazing

66
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,264
But even with all the architectural variety of Los Angeles

67
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,080
Some buildings just keep coming back on screen

68
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
Again and again

69
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,920
Those architectural gems are very

70
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
Particular and very kind of

71
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Binding

72
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,880
It's someone's watching it for like pina 10 minutes going like this feels so familiar what is this location

73
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
I know I know it and then I'll just

74
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,976
Oh my God that's the Bradbury Building

75
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
The Bradbury Building

76
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,608
Arguably the biggest architectural movie star of Los Angeles

77
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
It's one of Lori's favorite locations

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
It can be modern that can be.

79
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
It's kind of

80
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
Upscale steampunk

81
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
The iron work

82
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Open balconies

83
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
Just beautiful building

84
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,736
The Bradbury made his first on-screen appearance in 1943

85
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
In the movie China Girl

86
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,064
When it played at Burmese Hotel

87
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
It played a London military hospital and white

88
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
The Dover

89
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:18,047
It was the background of the Fillmore style Thriller DOA in 1950

90
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Model

91
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,143
In the 1969 movie Marlowe

92
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,703
Bruce Lee steps into an office of the Bradbury

93
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
And kicks all the furniture apart

94
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,103
Who played in office again in the final scene of 500 Days of Summer

95
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Next to me

96
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
It was a movie studio in the artist

97
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,271
It was a chocolate factory in a recent commercial for Twix

98
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:43,135
But the Bradbury's most famous role of all was as the toymaker's house

99
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
In the 1982 movie

100
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Blade Runner

101
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,399
In Blade Runner the Bradbury is a dark Moody ruin

102
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,031
Which seems like some real Hollywood magic when you see what the building actually looks like

103
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,847
From the outside the Bradbury just looks like a brick office

104
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
This building at the corner of 3rd and Broadway downtown

105
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Kind of unremarkable

106
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,247
But then you step inside and it's like

107
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
Is this great

108
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,671
Biblical shaft of light shining through it

109
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:23,327
It's basically a tall narrow Courtyard Walden with terracotta covered with a glass ceiling and flanked by two

110
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,655
Do iron clanking hydraulic powered elevators

111
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,471
The kind that are still run by human operators

112
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
Avery Road in one

113
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
Cheap is it at the building

114
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Thank you

115
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,919
There's a reason the Bradbury is in so many films

116
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
For 1

117
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
It's really beautiful

118
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
For the tile

119
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Steps are marble

120
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Annies

121
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,135
Floor in the atrium with a layer of ornate

122
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Wrought iron balcony

123
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
But it's not just Aesthetics

124
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,071
You have the balcony isn't all of the different levels and you can shoot across and down and

125
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:59,167
Catty-corner the balconies allow the crew to shoot at many different angles

126
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
And create a whole range of different moods

127
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
For various genres

128
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:09,407
The romantic comedy would probably be straight on the horror movie would be more shooting up shooting damage in that sense

129
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,247
Vertigo and the Bradbury can accommodate all the film gear

130
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:18,111
I just have to get in so many toys you know the lights in the boom arm and this and that

131
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,415
But look at the ceiling height this is great

132
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
Hosts of the Bradbury is near a parking lot

133
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
Which is surprisingly crucial

134
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,887
Because it don't shoot involves Vans and trailers and tons of people and tons of equipment

135
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,447
And the parking lot is the place to put it all

136
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:37,055
It's also nice that the Bradbury is close to downtown and the crew can just go grab lunch

137
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
It is

138
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,639
There's like nothing like it in Los Angeles them

139
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,991
So that's Kim Cooper architectural historian

140
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,575
She brought me back to the Bradbury along with her husband Richard shaver

141
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
We are founders of Essex

142
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
Twerk

143
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
Is a

144
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
Bus tour company

145
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:00,607
That gives tours of Los Angeles focusing on architecture True Crime and literature

146
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
Free element switch

147
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
All come to a head

148
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
The Bradbury

149
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,591
The Bradbury opened in 1893 way before the movies ever came to LA

150
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,687
And for the record it's not named after the Sci-Fi novelist Ray Bradbury

151
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
Name for Louis

152
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
A gold mining millionaire

153
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,087
In the mid-1890s Ribery

154
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
Decided he was going to build building

155
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:29,791
With his name on it because he was an important man that built up the city so in 1892 Bradbury

156
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,399
Brake emissions this big deal famous architect Sumner hunt to design his building

157
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,727
The Bradbury didn't like any of the plans at Hunt Showdown

158
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
Bradbury disappointed

159
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
Turns to leave Hunt's office

160
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
But

161
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
As he goes out

162
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
For some reason

163
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
His eyes caught

164
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
Buy one of Hunt's draftsman

165
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
This young guy name

166
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,039
George Wyman

167
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
2930

168
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
He has no

169
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
Professional training yet

170
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,231
As an architect and no one knows why

171
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
Takes women

172
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
Pulse asleep

173
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
I have an offer to make tea

174
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,935
Well that offer is completely impossible and inappropriate he wants

175
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
The higher the skit was an alarm

176
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
To build this very important

177
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
And this young guy George Wyman

178
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Is a bit weirded out

179
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Understand

180
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Because he is

181
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,223
Totally unqualified for this job

182
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,319
And he didn't want it to seem like he was taking business away from his boss

183
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
But on the other hand

184
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,415
This opportunity was incredible

185
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
It's

186
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
An irresistible offer

187
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
But George Wyman is an ethical man

188
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:38,399
And he's also scared to death and so he does what any good Angelina will do

189
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,727
In the very late 19th century which is he will consult dead relatives

190
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
Spiritualism with huge at this

191
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:52,479
And George Wyman thought that his deceased brother Mark might have some wisdom to offer from the afterlife

192
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,087
So why man sits down with a planchette a precursor to a Ouija board which

193
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,159
Rode out sentences with a pencil when you rested your hands on it

194
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:05,535
Planchette's would typically be consulted when someone had an issue that they wanted some guidance on

195
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,703
So he and his wife were sitting together saying what on Earth should I do about mr. Bradbury's wonderful terrifying off

196
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
The planchette

197
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,055
Overcome with the spirit of Wyman's Dead Brother

198
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Began

199
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
And it wrote

200
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,991
Take Bradbury in in a very childish script and

201
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
You will be

202
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Blah blah blah

203
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Justice

204
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
Nonsense script

205
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,999
And women and his wife were like one and it was when one of the two of them walked around the other side of the of the

206
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,351
People in read it upside down this Palmer typescript actually said successful

207
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Cakebread

208
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
You will be

209
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,007
That was a clear enough message for women

210
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,799
He says yes to Bradbury

211
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,663
The design of the Bradbury was directly inspired by a novel

212
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
Looking backwards by Edward Bellamy

213
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
Which was written in 1887

214
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
But in it

215
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,367
There's a description of a building in the year 2000

216
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
The future

217
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
Women with

218
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,279
Trying to do with this balloon I think I think we can answer just simply by reading the passage

219
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
A vast Hall full of light

220
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,423
Received not alone from the windows on all sides but from the Dome

221
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
So that's

222
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
What this building does

223
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:24,383
And that's why even though the Bradbury is quite old by California Sanders it field current

224
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,687
It was designed for the year 2000

225
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,271
It's this blend of styles that makes it an architectural gem

226
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:35,135
But aside from the occasional film shoot the building spent a lot of its life totally ignored

227
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,999
Late 40s early 50s is once described as a chicken

228
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,863
And in that just refers to the dustiness and the sword of untidiness

229
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
By 74

230
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,215
This this place is really falling apart

231
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:55,615
So when Ridley Scott shot Blade Runner and it's Central Atrium it wasn't actually that hard to make it look so shabby

232
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Blade Runner

233
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
That was just

234
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,455
Amazing that was before we'd actually

235
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
Fix it up and you can tell that

236
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
From the movie

237
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,343
This is Adele yellin

238
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,903
But my husband bought the building

239
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
In the late 80s

240
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
And he retrofit

241
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
Adele's late husband

242
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
IRA yellin

243
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,351
Spearheaded LA's downtown Revival

244
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,655
If I restore an old historic building

245
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,191
And turning them into housing

246
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Businesses

247
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
But the Bradbury was just

248
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:27,359
Virtual and he wanted to work on it then he felt if you build it they will come

249
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
So

250
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
I don't know

251
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,015
They ultimately came but he he did have to use

252
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
I have the city to help him

253
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
Arielle and asked

254
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
If the city of Los Angeles could find a steady

255
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
Lieutenant for the Bradbury

256
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
He ended up getting the

257
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Police Department

258
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,911
Most of the office space in the Bradbury Building belongs to the internal affairs division of the LAPD

259
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,727
Yeah they're they're there all the time and

260
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,311
They don't mind the filming generally Bender

261
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
Hino handled all the filming requests

262
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
For the Bradbury

263
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
What we do a

264
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
The police

265
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
Drama will you take extra

266
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
Precaution to make sure they know that

267
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:10,111
We're filming and the person running around with a gun type of thing is not

268
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
Very

269
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,743
But filming isn't the priority for the property anymore

270
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,559
Send it to Innovation the tenants needs come first

271
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,399
Try not to bother the tenants too much so we try to

272
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,727
Do the filming or not do more than one or two filming project

273
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
4 month

274
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,079
And generally this is the case throughout buildings downtown

275
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:35,199
Now that people live and work there they don't want production Crews periodically taking over

276
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,855
These days film Crews can't blow up cars in the street or have 300 zombies Stampy down Broadway in the middle

277
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
Full of the workday

278
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,951
The downtown Revival is a part of why

279
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
Filming is leaving Los

280
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
It laugh

281
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,607
I mean there's no feature films shooting here I've

282
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,143
It's scary

283
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,519
Because I said I love living here and I would like to continue sleeping in my bed if possible

284
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,359
Location scout Lori Balton just spent almost a year

285
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,919
Scouting and shooting in Atlanta Georgia

286
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
Which might just be

287
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
Become the new Hollywood

288
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
Because I've spent so much time in Atlanta it's like I'll look at a moving go oh yeah that's Aslan that you can't fool me

289
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,231
Atlanta like a lot of other cities in the South Midwest and Canada

290
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
It's offering major incentives to encourage filming

291
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:28,447
These tax breaks can say producers millions of dollars

292
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,775
Going broke giving the incentives that they are

293
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,615
Cities like Atlanta are also developing state-of-the-art Studios

294
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
And attracting good production town

295
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
We're

296
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,759
Really need to do everything we can to keep filming in LA

297
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,087
Which would mean making the public more open to the disruptor

298
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Custom chutes

299
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
Bookkeeping the cost of

300
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,439
Permits down and adding new tax incentives

301
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,743
And to stop developing so rapidly

302
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:56,607
What's happening in La as we're losing a lot of our parking lots that will tear them down and putting buildings up

303
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,703
It's so funny to hear people bemoaned the loss of parking lot

304
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,031
People location people there's a difference

305
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,847
We're kind of a weird breed

306
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:11,967
But however state-of-the-art studios in Atlanta Toronto or Chicago are becoming

307
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,295
There are elements of Los Angeles that cannot be replicated

308
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
Even on the finest soundstage

309
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,415
Like experience of entering the Bradbury Building

310
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
The place so unique

311
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
So remarkable

312
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
But after it was built

313
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
The draftsman George Wyman decided

314
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
Take some classes

315
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
And actually become

316
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:41,919
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Avery troubleman with Katie mingle Sam Greenspan and me Roman Mars

317
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,759
Special things this week to Linda Dishman head of the LA Conservancy

318
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:52,671
We are project of 91.7 local public radio kalw San Francisco and produce of the offices

319
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Cos of arcsin

320
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
In architecture and Interiors

321
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
In beautiful downtown

322
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Oakland California

323
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Between the beats

324
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,167
Bongs and chatter of our devices

325
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
We're immersed

326
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,495
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

327
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
If

328
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:12,127
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

329
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:18,015
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room in a kid is another word for all hearing that voice

330
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
Technology

331
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
You talk to us

332
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
It is a creation of Sonic trash

333
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,183
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

334
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,511
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

335
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
To make them more human

336
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
Turn the living room lights on

337
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Okay

338
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
Dim the living room lights

339
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
50%

340
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Okay

341
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:47,199
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

342
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,503
Makes for a much more natural

343
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Experience

344
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
Turn the living room lights on

345
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
Dim the living room lights.

346
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
50%

347
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:03,839
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

About how are soundscape is impacting our health

349
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

351
