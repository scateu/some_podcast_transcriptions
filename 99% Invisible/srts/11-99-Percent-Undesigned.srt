Against you

30
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,264
Everything is designed to just use more and more fuel as you'll see you Lisa Martinelli argues

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
Designed might not be the right word

32
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
But let's just say design

33
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
My name is Lisa margonelli

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
And I wrote

Avocado oil on the brain petroleum's long strange trip to your tank first

36
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
A metaphor

37
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
We are on a

38
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,856
A couple months ago I was at a tugboat race

39
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,184
And we're looking at an old Tugboat from when they used to be

40
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
Buy coal

41
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,048
And it was beautiful is shaped like a canoe on the bottom and the house on top was

42
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
Surrounded

43
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
Aerodynamic

44
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
Just like it is in the Popeye cartoon

45
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
Is gorgeous

46
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:18,240
It was all very streamlined to slip through the water in through the air on top

47
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,544
But there's also a newer diesel Tucker

48
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,336
The whole is

49
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Relatively

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,432
Squarish I mean it's shape to go through the water but things are not

51
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
Scooped the way they were in the other one

52
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
And the top is just straight flat

53
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,576
Steel they don't even bother

54
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
30 shape them

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
They just

56
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
Skin pain all the corners and the reason is that

57
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,464
When you have a coal-fired tugboat

58
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Every bit

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,792
A cold that you have to put on that tugboat

60
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
Master converter

61
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,376
Power and you want to reduce the amount of

62
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
With diesel fuel

63
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
It's very easy it's

64
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
Plentiful now

65
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,056
It's much easier to just design the

66
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
Tugboat to use more fuel

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,152
To waste fuel essentially

68
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
Ban

69
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
To shape the steel

70
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
And design that tugboat

71
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040
To use less

72
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
So few lives are expended

73
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
And the whole world is designed as a big diesel

74
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
Square bottom

75
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,792
Tugboat to the biggest waste of energy is the wholesale

76
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:19,424
In the most wasteful component of that whole system in the US is the way we drive to and from work

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
The whole process

78
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,240
Selling mortgages and selling houses

79
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
Over the last

80
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
15 years or so is based on this

81
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
SEPTA drive to the koala

82
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
So you drove a

83
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Best far out

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,944
You could stand

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,016
To the place where you could get a decent rate on a mortgage

86
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
House with a low enough

87
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
Payments and at the same time you get

88
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Get like more Square

89
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
What supported the

90
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Was that

91
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Can you drive

92
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Where to get into the city

93
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
To do your job

94
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,632
And then what supported that was that they were just

95
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
Countdown really big

96
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Carso

97
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
If you'd been making that

98
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,752
Trip in a small car Emoji felt a little

99
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
But you could buy this

100
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
Palatial

101
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
And those big cars have horrible gas

102
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
Fidessa

103
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
Everything along the way app

104
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
To burn more gas

105
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
Apps just stopping at a

106
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
What is an enormous

107
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Energy

108
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
What does the Ops

109
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
Even barreling down the highway at

110
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
Top speed is

111
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,208
No problem cars were tuned

112
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
3 most efficient around 50

113
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
55 to 6

114
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
That's the speed the government used to

115
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
The test for fuel efficient

116
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,143
So they were essentially designed to be

117
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
Less efficient at the speeds that we really

118
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Because we really dry

119
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
Rm60

120
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
270

121
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
It's as if

122
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,103
Some Evil Genius designer system

123
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
That we will waste

124
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Gasoline

125
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
How evil is this

126
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,503
It's more much more banal than evil

127
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,295
If someone sat down to Concha

128
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,599
Justly design this thing I don't know that they could do so

129
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
Of making a mess

130
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,463
Is the tyranny of the lack of design

131
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
The tragedy

132
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
Building a bad idea

133
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
On a thoughtless notion

134
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
On a careless

135
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,191
Plan another dumb thing piles onto another dumb saying and pretty soon we've got just a

136
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
Huge tangle

137
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
Find gasoline

138
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
Fairly cheaply

139
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,103
And speaking of buying gasoline

140
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
Chiefly there is something does

141
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Actually design

142
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
To make you more

143
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
Comfortable

144
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
With all of this

145
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
When you buy gas

146
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,295
We don't like to be in gas stations refill

147
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
Dangerous and

148
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
We don't like to be paying money for gasoline to the oil companies and we always feel the gas is too expensive no matter what the price

149
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:24,863
SO gas pumps have been specifically designed to sort of diffuse that anger

150
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,983
So they did some market research and I found that people have warm feelings towards ATM machines

151
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
And they had bad feelings toward God

152
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,079
So they redesigned the

153
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:40,479
Gas pumps to look a little bit more like ATM machine so you felt like you were having sort of an intimate warm experience

154
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
When you were at the gas pump

155
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:48,159
As opposed to thinking about hitting the oil company because we want an experienced in tune with our values

156
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
Even if what we're doing

157
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,967
Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

165
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,063
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a

166
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

167
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
We're looking the part

168
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,183
Might cost you your life

169
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

170
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,655
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

171
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:35,007
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

172
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,615
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

173
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,967
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of

174
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:51,391
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

175
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,719
Was found dead in my private gym

176
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,047
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

177
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,399
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

178
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,727
Now I need to clear my name

179
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:11,103
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

180
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
