00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,232
The proud family goes to wherever you get your podcast and find out why they say

21
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,768
Every house is haunted

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
This is 99% invisible

23
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352
I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,752
Over the years I guess about 20 people have written to us suggesting that we

25
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,152
We do a story about The Mysterious Giant concrete arrows that. The US landscape from New York to San Francisco

26
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
You don't know these are about seventy feet of what looks pretty much like sidewalk Concrete in the shape of an arrow pointing

27
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Bakery

28
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976
West the date for the 1930s and they were part of the Transcontinental Airway system that help planes carrying mail

29
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,584
Find their way across the US before the age of reliable radar and GPS

30
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
When they were operational they were painted bright yellow were accompanied by a tower topped with a bright rotating Beacon

31
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,360
Today the towers and paint are long gone but many of the giant arrows remain

32
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
Sometimes with weeds poke

33
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
Do the cracks like a

34
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
Crete

35
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,528
They're super cool and fun to find on Google Maps

36
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
That's about it

37
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,136
There's not too much more of a story there

38
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,696
I'm glad I know it I'm pleased about it

39
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
Totally of 99% invisible

40
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
Story

41
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,560
And I'm honored when people learn about them and they think

42
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
I need to send this to Roman

43
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
But ultimately

44
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,472
The arrows are not something on which we can hang a whole episode

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,544
We come across these kinds of stories all the time

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,872
Not Justa suggestions from the audience but in our own research

47
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
There are tons of little

48
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
Interesting

49
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
Would be 99 Pi story

50
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
Cut out of an episode or just

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,136
Don't want it 6 weeks of production in 20 minutes of airtime for whatever

52
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,184
But we still kind of love

53
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,280
So as a little change of pace we thought we throw them all together

54
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,864
In a couple of episodes featuring me interviewing the 99 Pi crew

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,656
Talking about their favorite

56
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
Mini store

57
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
That's what we've been calling

58
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
I think you're going to take it

59
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
I certainly had fun talking to

60
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
So without further ado

61
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
First.

62
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
Is Sam Greenspan

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,624
What are my favorite things about this job is that I get to go to research at the University of California at Berkeley Library

64
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
In the environmental design Library

65
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,024
And it's a smart building

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,840
The library itself has all these Vasily chair set

67
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
Might actually be able to buy house but

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Anyway

69
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
I was over there I was doing research on the story that would eventually become the plot of Zion which aired on the show last week

70
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,920
Yeah that's that this is worried about those were the founders vision for the Church of Latter-day Saints in

71
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,504
Pinto Lake City in their efforts to create like an Urban Brick of really big

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Exact

73
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
Exactly

74
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,368
I was reading this article just in my research there

75
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
Called the Mormon Village

76
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,488
Genesis and antecedents of the city of Zion plan

77
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,792
By Richard H Jackson published in the journal

78
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,120
Brigham Young University studies 1977

79
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:54,240
Here's the author of this article talking about how most towns west of Appalachia all kind of developed

80
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,568
The same way and so Roman if you would read this quote from him

81
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,200
The cities and towns which were founded during this period were remarkably similar

82
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,760
With the exception of Circleville Ohio

83
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,832
Most town-plots consisted of a regular grid pattern

84
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,880
With straight streets Crossing at writing

85
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,416
Ashley I

86
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
I grew up

87
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,303
In Newark Ohio which is only about 30 miles away from Circleville Ohio so I know Circleville

88
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
I don't know if I've been there like it famous for

89
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Mountains like an Indian Barrel

90
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,567
Funny you should mention that will Circleville is also known for something else or maybe not known for something else but it has

91
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,127
A quite amazing history

92
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,199
Up urban planning

93
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
To look so what did you find out

94
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
Okay so from that one glib note in this

95
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,111
In this journal article about morning villages

96
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
I found this other article in the Journal of the Society of architectural historians for 1955 Sky name John

97
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
BMW wraps

98
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
And it had an article entitled

99
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,631
Redevelopment in the 19th century

100
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Colon

101
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,799
The squaring of Circleville of Circleville power broker

102
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
Pickaway County Ohio named Daniel Dreisbach

103
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,199
Was deputized to establish a new town will become the county seat

104
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,807
Dreisbach decided on a piece of land to head to Native American Earthworks

105
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,927
Mounds basically one in the shape of a square and one the shape of a circle in central Ohio

106
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
These types of melons are like

107
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
Will incorporate into landscape still life

108
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:26,911
I grew up going to Indian Mound Mall Newark Ohio and so they're in Newark they're in Circleville

109
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,263
They're all around there's a big their big part of the landscape and the carnival or

110
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
And the Mystique

111
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
Central Ohio

112
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
And they really are like

113
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,943
In the center of the city like there was no regard for them they just put

114
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
City on top

115
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Of the mountain

116
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,575
Circleville is totally case of that Daniel Dreisbach

117
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,391
Just wanted to plop a city right on top of this

118
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
Native American Mound

119
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,023
But what he did that his contemporaries found so weird

120
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
Was that he used the circular

121
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
Earthwork

122
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,167
To build a city with a circular grid

123
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
So normally so imagine we're kind of like

124
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,799
Floating over a city you can kind of see

125
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
They're floating over Chicago right now

126
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
Big

127
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
Salt Lake City all kind of crossing at right angles

128
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,343
It's just sort of like you know grid-like wrap paper

129
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
So this looks more like

130
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
The wheel of a pirate ship

131
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,279
Right what's the steering wheel of a pirate ship

132
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
There's a storage Central node

133
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:33,471
And an Android box plan there was the the county courthouse would be in the middle and there's kind of a big closet around

134
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
And then there's

135
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:39,359
A circular Street around that and then another circular Street around that one

136
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
It'll be sort of

137
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,991
These roads that I'll shoot off from the courthouse that all kind of connect

138
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,551
Outwards that all lead back into

139
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
The center of the Earth

140
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
Which is all being formed

141
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
Mighty circular

142
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
Indian male

143
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
Yeah I was sort of the framework

144
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
Matt was going to give me idea

145
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Established

146
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
The early eighteen hundreds

147
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
People start moving in

148
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,935
But to the founder Daniel Dreisbach sis may

149
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
The circle villains

150
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Heat it

151
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,031
Like really really hate it

152
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
It was dismissed as

153
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
Childish sentimentalism

154
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,687
People complain that the round Street

155
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
It's made for awkwardly shaped Lots

156
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
The Builder house is kind of in a weird ways

157
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,623
So 1837 about 30 years

158
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,719
The people were so fed up with this circular grid

159
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
They appealed the Ohio State Assembly

160
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,935
They just wanted some Ohio

161
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,239
Squaresville more less so

162
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
They hired a company

163
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:45,919
Call the Circleville squaring company yeah

164
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
And squaring company was hired to D Circle Circleville

165
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,927
Two decades but eventually they were successful so

166
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,999
Today if you go to Google Earth and you look up

167
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
Circleville Ohio

168
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
Zoom in

169
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,191
It just does a grid it looks like

170
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Every other

171
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
Bordentown

172
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,079
In central Ohio to Circleville square and Company was extremely excited

173
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
They did their job

174
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
For sure All That Remains are a few around the buildings I hear I haven't been there

175
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Never been changed

176
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,831
Reminder have not yet called it squaresville

177
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
And the City of Municipal seal

178
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
That's pretty nice it's like it's like

179
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,071
It looks like the original Urban plan

180
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,375
I believe that's Daniel box

181
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Original

182
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
Drawing

183
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Or some some kind of

184
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
Reproduction based on Dreisbach

185
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,823
Original plan where you can see the courthouse in the middle and you can come see all the

186
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
The other radio streets coming off of it

187
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,455
Yeah it looks really cool pretty good co

188
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
It reveals some good history

189
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,807
That's so cool I mean don't put on a flag that's a good to you

190
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,111
Yeah I think it's like she just beat you know the

191
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
History of the Pirates

192
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
That would work

193
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
That would work

194
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,031
So I'm Kurt Kolstad and I am the digital director

195
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
At 9% invisible

196
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
As well as I went

197
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
What is that mean

198
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
Basically means I manage

199
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,223
Content and design on the website

200
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,039
So we produce articles for the website

201
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
We also please companion piece

202
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
For every episode

203
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,647
That contain additional materials

204
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Videos

205
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
Lynx images

206
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
So

207
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,583
People listen via episode can go on the website listen to the episode but also surf around 4

208
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Traditional media

209
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
Right

210
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,679
So if you are listening tonight

211
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
But you never been to the website

212
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,287
You are missing out because there's at least

213
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,103
Two and maybe three more stories a week

214
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
Better on the website

215
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
That

216
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
Have nothing to do with what is being

217
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,039
Write 2 in a lot of cases we have

218
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,647
An idea for a story and there's just kind of not enough there for

219
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
As to make a full episode

220
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,743
But it wouldn't be long enough it wouldn't be in-depth enough

221
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,559
Or simply to visualize a lot of cases

222
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
If it's something that

223
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
You need absolutely need to see a graphic

224
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,471
An image or a video for

225
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
The subject matter to make sense

226
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,103
We're going to have to make that into an article instead of an episode

227
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,943
But the topics are really the same it's you know it's built environments it's

228
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
CNN News

229
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,271
99% invisible things you see at the world

230
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
Do not make sense of

231
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:38,463
And it's a lot of cases these ideas they've been kicking around in the office for years and now they've kind of finally

232
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
An outlet in the form of what

233
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Which one is like

234
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
Quintessential

235
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Really popular one that

236
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
That would be

237
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
So the Dutch reach

238
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,263
Has been a real hit this year and I don't think anybody expected

239
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
It's a pretty short piece

240
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
How about a pretty simple fix

241
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:01,503
Two pretty common problems that just resonated with listeners and readers in a way that nobody could have

242
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
So what is the Dutch race

243
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,855
Dutch reach is basically a technique

244
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
For keeping bikers

245
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Cyclist that is

246
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
Scrum getting doored

247
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
So

248
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,839
If you're driving along you got a Viking Land on your right and parking to the right at bat

249
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
And you pull over into a parking spot

250
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
And you go to open the car door

251
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
And a cyclist is coming

252
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
You might not see

253
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,335
And that's because in part

254
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,383
You're opening the door with your left hand

255
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
If you're an American driver

256
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
And

257
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,039
You're just you know you look in the rearview mirror you might not spot them

258
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:41,183
But there's one simple way to make sure that every time you open a car door you're looking to see if cyclists are approaching

259
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,975
And that's by reaching over yourself

260
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
With your other arm to open the door

261
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
Saloniture I have this

262
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
So you pull over

263
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,167
And instead of opening the car door with your left hand which

264
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
Inclined to do

265
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
You reach over with your right hand

266
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
And it causes you to come

267
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
Westin look over your shoulder

268
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
And really check

269
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
If there's a cycle

270
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Exactly

271
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
And

272
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
It's very simple solution

273
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
Doesn't have any Associated cost it doesn't take any extra

274
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,391
Time Italy any driver could do in any bites of this

275
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Be grateful that

276
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
The driver is doing

277
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,303
It's a solution we can all relate to it something that deals with a problem built environment

278
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,887
Probably isn't going to be fixed anytime soon other ways

279
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,775
It just costs too much and takes too much time for cities to overhaul these systems course and Ideal World we'd have protect

280
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Bike Lanes

281
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,359
And I need to know everything to be perfect

282
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
But

283
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,199
In the world we live in this Dutch reach solution

284
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Which comes from Holland

285
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
Hence the name

286
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
It gives drivers a way to

287
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
To do something simple that will help improve safety

288
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
She for everybody involved

289
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
Interested

290
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
What's all that

291
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
I just shared it

292
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,303
Like crazy because it was something you could like understand quickly

293
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,119
It's giving sort of common sense but it's one of the Great

294
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
Like a perfect sort of story like the exes

295
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
You witness early figure out on your own

296
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
But when you see it

297
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
It feels like

298
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,639
Exactly it's the kind of solution that once we

299
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Eurostar

300
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
Teaching people to do this and driver's education

301
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,575
It would just become second nature and we wouldn't even think about it as

302
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
The Dutch reach it would just be

303
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
The way you open a car door

304
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
Cool

305
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
All right

306
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Thanks

307
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
Tell me who you are

308
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
Yeah my name is Emmett

309
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Fitzgerald

310
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
To use came on like a few months ago

311
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
Yeah I came in

312
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Help out when

313
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Delaney

314
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Wizometer

315
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,607
We decided to

316
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
What kinds of little stories that maybe

317
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,519
You'll be researched as producers and reporters butt

318
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
Don't really quite qualify as a full nine NPI stories were there like little things were cut out of other stories so

319
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
So what is you are a minister

320
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,319
This is a story about a special soccer stuff

321
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,623
TDM in the northern Brazilians

322
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
State of amapa

323
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
Like a super remote status

324
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
Order something

325
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
1000 people

326
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
And

327
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
90%

328
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Amazon

329
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Rainforest

330
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
But there are a couple little

331
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
The capital city

332
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Maca powder

333
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
And

334
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Maca pot

335
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
Is known or is assertive

336
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,711
Visit there one of the things that

337
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
There

338
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
Write on me

339
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
Equator and the number of landmarks

340
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
Signifies

341
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
Where the equator is in the

342
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
City including

343
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,999
One of the Central Street is called Avenida equatorial which

344
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Rotten

345
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,839
Supposedly along the Equator and has a red stripe

346
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
Center of

347
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,191
Of the street and another thing that sits

348
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Right on the equator is that the

349
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
City soccer

350
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
Which is

351
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,079
10000 person

352
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Arena

353
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,407
That's called estadio Milton Correa

354
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Local soccer

355
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Bureaucratic

356
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,831
But everyone just calls me meme

357
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
The big 0

358
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
After after the stadiums

359
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,231
Urbini equator is the 0

360
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,119
The stadium itself sits on a latitude line video on the equator but that

361
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
The equator runs directly

362
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
Down the Midfield line of

363
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
Death of the football pitch

364
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
Soccer field

365
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
And so

366
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,663
Small Brazilian

367
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,759
Professional soccer clubs but because of the midpoint lies the equator it's like

368
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
Each side

369
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,319
In the game

370
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:58,719
Is representing an entire hemisphere small local Club games are are really like

371
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,327
Battle between North and South

372
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:09,215
Middle East in Asia

373
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
Teen suicides

374
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
And you know it

375
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,615
That's kind of all there is

376
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,943
My look up on YouTube some games in

377
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,551
And she are you know for the sake of it here's a clip of someone scoring a goal

378
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:29,951
The big 0

379
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
Tell me your name

380
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
My name is Delaney Hall

381
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
What are you doing here

382
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,087
I'm a reporter and producer

383
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
Sometimes I edit

384
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,183
So what is your mini story

385
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,047
So my mini story actually came to us from one of our listeners

386
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:10,143
Woman named Carrie Nugent from

387
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
Because I was at a conference

388
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
And

389
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263
She had on very memorably

390
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
A camouflage baseball hat

391
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,359
With orange letters that said

392
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,943
Asteroid

393
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,087
Yeah I mean she is an asteroid Hunter she's an asteroid scientist at

394
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Caltech

395
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
And she actually has her own

396
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
Podcast called space pod

397
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,815
Where she talks with different scientists who study space

398
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,631
So our listeners right in a lot

399
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
Saying you should do story about this so you should

400
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,471
It was right about that and

401
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,519
Kerry suggested one that I

402
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
Really like

403
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
So what is about

404
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
Before I can tell you

405
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:57,759
What carries suggested I have to back up a little bit so earlier this year there was this enormous

406
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,319
Discovery in astronomy

407
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,719
And there's an experiment called the laser interferometer gravitational-wave Observatory

408
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,095
The shorter way to refer to it as ligo

409
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:16,447
And scientists working on that experiment detected a signal

410
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
From space

411
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
They turned into a sound

412
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
So I'm going to play the sound for you

413
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,903
Am I listening for the one that one that's going

414
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:43,071
What that sound that sound is the sound of two black holes collide

415
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
Riding an unleashing

416
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,703
The energy of a million trillion Suns

417
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:55,103
Doesn't actually sound like much and that's because the black holes Collide a bill

418
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Million years ago

419
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,783
And so the sound has been traveling through space for all of those years getting fainter and fainter as it goes

420
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,903
And by the time it actually reached us here on Earth it was just that little boy

421
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,255
But the scientist amazingly

422
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Heard it

423
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,815
Why is it so amazing

424
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,351
Because it is the first

425
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,679
Direct evidence of gravitational waves

426
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
Which are

427
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,263
Physically ripples in space-time

428
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:30,175
And gravitational waves were predicted more than a hundred years ago by Einstein in his theory of Jen

429
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
General relativity

430
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:36,063
And that Siri totally reimagined the rules of his

431
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,647
Basically instead of a static framework

432
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,695
Einstein had this Theory

433
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,999
That matter and energy

434
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
Could actually do

435
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Stewart

436
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
The geometry of the universe

437
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,143
And create these ripples of grab

438
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,983
And so he had theorized

439
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,031
Do gravitational waves exist

440
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,615
But this sound was the first evidence that there

441
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Real

442
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:07,039
And so it basically was evidence that this wild Siri that Einstein had that have been mathematically prove

443
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,319
Prevent

444
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
It seems like

445
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
Well

446
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
Yeah yeah it was

447
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
Kind of mind-blowing

448
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,047
The discovery generated at

449
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
None of news

450
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,607
Obviously

451
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:24,447
But as carry our listener Rodan to point out

452
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
There is a design angle

453
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:31,871
I'm always in favor of design angles

454
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:36,991
What she was interested in and what she said you should really look at is the instrument

455
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,087
The machine that detected the sound

456
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
Is amazing

457
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,671
An extremely

458
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,791
You know it would have to be sensitive in order to pick up a sound that's been

459
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:54,143
Traveling through space and decaying for a billion years

460
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,215
So Carrie said you should do a story about this instrument

461
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
The detective the sounds

462
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:06,431
Why did we do that story cuz it's so hard drive its like the Somme

463
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,503
How much technical detail will probably

464
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:15,391
Saying things that are wrong right now even in a mini story it's just it's

465
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:22,048
You know it's too technically complex and sort of difficult to describe on the radio I mean the machine

466
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Peanuts office light

467
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:29,984
Part of its in one part of the country and part of its another part of the gun is like

468
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,800
Like stretch

469
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,592
Really complicated but

470
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,944
There was this one element to it that that I love and that I think

471
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,320
We can do justice to right now

472
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,392
So basically the detectors on this instrument

473
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,720
They had to be totally isolated

474
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,024
From the vibrations and noises of the outs

475
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
World

476
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
Because

477
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,656
Environmental noise might have interfered with what

478
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
The scientist

479
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
Actually trying to hear

480
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,544
So they're trying to hear this tiny faint sound

481
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,384
And then meanwhile there's just everyday noise all around them

482
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,456
Trucks driving by

483
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,784
People talking rumbles of the Earth

484
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Wind

485
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:21,952
At everything

486
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,000
There might be a thunderstorm

487
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,792
All of that noise

488
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,328
Can meth with

489
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,168
So basically to deal with that

490
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,728
The scientist first of all tried to isolate the

491
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,568
And they put them in giant

492
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,152
Isolate them from from all that outside noise

493
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
And then on top of that

494
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,504
The experiment employed

495
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
Two people

496
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,064
Who were environmental Mana

497
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,624
So their job is to figure out

498
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,416
How environmental sound

499
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,976
Might interfere with the experiment

500
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,024
Terry actually talked

501
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,816
To the guy who ran the Explorer

502
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,608
Dr. Dave Ramsey

503
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,424
He's the head of ligo and here he is

504
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
And they do tests

505
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
So dope

506
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
Speakers

507
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,336
In the vacuum time either vacuum tanks and you can

508
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,128
Play your favorite Symphony and

509
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
Measure its effect

510
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,528
Yeah so they they play these recordings they did stuff like Brew play recording the

511
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
Howlin Wolf

512
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,624
And they even had a staff member

513
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,024
Ride-away on his Harley to record the effect that the rumbling motor had on the

514
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
Experiment

515
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
Is a great entry

516
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,168
By the team that was doing the environmental monitoring

517
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
Bubba rides off in a motorcycle

518
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,616
Facility managers in Hanford and he was doing a test for

519
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,176
And so over time they generated this

520
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,480
Huge library of

521
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,576
What different kinds of Sonic interference might do to the experiment

522
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,904
Genuine signal appeared

523
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,952
They would know

524
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
That it wasn't just

525
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
Environmental noise

526
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
I thought I was in love

527
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,096
Did it wasn't Bubba

528
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,168
It's hard to convey like how crazy it is

529
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,216
Is the day were able to detect this sound

530
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,776
Another crazy thing is they detected it

531
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:18,176
Like right after they turned the experiment

532
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,224
It was my mistake this is one of the biggest

533
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
Side effects

534
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:27,392
Discoveries ever yeah yeah and I I I really love this kind of science story or

535
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,208
Or this detail about sort of depressed

536
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,304
I'm just all the mundane everyday

537
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,584
Stuff that can

538
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,400
Get in the way of that grand Magna

539
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
That's okay

540
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,496
So we should thank you

541
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
Yes yes

542
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,848
Tom so thank you dr. Carrie Nugent

543
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
She's one of our listeners

544
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,480
And she did a whole interview with dr. Dave racing

545
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,784
Is the head of ligo it's on her podcast

546
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
It's called space

547
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Pod

548
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,624
And she just know so much more about

549
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,976
If you have any questions or complaints

550
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:07,328
To read them the doctor New Delhi

551
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,568
So that was many stories volume 1

552
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,872
In the final episode of 2016

553
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,712
I interviewed all the 99 Pi producers for this project

554
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,016
So you hear the rest of the crew on the 1st
