Hounded and pursued patent violator struck back

It made it possible

For average working people to afford quality dentures

43
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,408
It's a very historically significant murder I mean anyone who ever

44
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
Gets dentures

45
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504

That's John Marr my name is John Marr I'm the editor and publisher of the fanzine murder can be fun

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
Before the 1850s Dentures were made at a very hard very painful and very expensive material like gold

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
Older ivory

49
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
They were a luxury item

50
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
But the invention of vulcanized

51
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
Hard rubber changed everything

52
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,336
It was moldable could be precisely fitted it was relatively cheap

53
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,408
Everyone began making dentures with vulcanite

54
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
And these Dentures have been

55
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
Overwhelmingly popular

56
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
But then in 1864 along disputed patent application originally filed a dozen years earlier and eight

57
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
1852

58
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
Was awarded and then acquired

59
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,280
Weather Goodyear Dental vulcanite company

60
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,096
He was a company created to collect feezor

61
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,144
Very often Sue dentist

62
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
Who already used vulcanite

63
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,240
There are plenty of Dennis to go after

64
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
And the person that went after them was named Josiah bacon

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
The treasurer of the Goodyear Dental vulcanite company

66
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,272
And I'm the Vulcan and Company was trying to collect and cuz I bake it was trying personal

67
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
Royalties for their patent

68
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,160
The Goodyear vulcanite company now monopolize the market

69
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:17,280
Dentists required to buy the Rubber and other Contraptions used to make denture bases from them

70
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,607
And they were heavy taxes and fees associated with all of this

71
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
The price just kept going up and up

72
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
Josiah bacon

73
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,263
Crisscrossing the country drawing Dennis in jail

74
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,055
Extracting fees fine

75
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
Setting up sting operations he's a very busy man

76
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
Very enthusiastic about enforcing his Pad

77
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:39,295
It was reported and disputed that bacon Zeal for enforcing the patent

78
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,695
May have been more his personal mission than that of a good year vulcanite company rig the deal so

79
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,255
He actually personally got the money in

80
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
I don't know how much

81
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,143
The details but it sounds like a very unusual Financial arrangement

82
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
With the company

83
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
Enter Samuel chalfant

84
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
Adult

85
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:03,103
Who made that choice and who didn't pay the Goodyear vulcanite company

86
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
For the privilege

87
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
And Josiah bacon without to make

88
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
An example of him

89
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
Josiah bacon had chased Chalfont

90
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
AutoZone Delaware

91
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,575
Out of them St Louis

92
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
And finally in Tampa

93
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
And he was swearing who's going to

94
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,791
Samuel chalfant was completely beaten down by this Relentless Pursuit

95
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:26,655
And claimed that he went to Josiah bacon the San Francisco hotel room on Easter Sunday 1879

96
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
To make peace

97
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
Play whatever you could

98
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
And just go back to being a simple dentist

99
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
However Chalfont

100
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
I'm had a gun in his paw

101
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,455
And as he says he argued with bacon bacon

102
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
Threaten to send in prison

103
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
Man some respect

104
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
Chalfont

105
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
Pulled a gun and

106
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,927
Has guns that you wave in front of your enemies always do

107
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
It went off

108
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
Samuel chauffant murdered Josiah Bank

109
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
Chalfant was like

110
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Extremely

111
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,679
Set aside in the hotel suite

112
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
Waiting for people

113
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Come into caps

114
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
Everyone's down and breakfasts

115
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
So we slipped out of hotel

116
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
And he wondered why the

117
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
And took a room in a cheap

118
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Rooming house

119
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
Could have laid in bed

120
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
A couple days you

121
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
Guilty feverish

122
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
Distraught

123
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
How many forms of energy

124
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
You made a statement to the police

125
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
He said that

126
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
He shot them

127
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Bacon

128
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:25,279
Accidentally in the police believe he was sincere and thinking that he have to come up with some

129
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,095
Story better than that if it was truly premeditated

130
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,911
However when it came time for trial

131
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
The prosecution

132
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,007
Had this man marching in the hotel room of his

133
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
Bitterest enemy with a loaded gun in his

134
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Pocket

135
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:43,455
The consensus was he was very lucky to get off with a 10-year sentence for second-degree murder

136
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,087
We actually had a very good gig in prison he was the the prison Dennis

137
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,903
Yatted office outside the walls

138
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,999
Or I should most importantly he didn't have to work in the jute Mill making burlap sacks

139
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Like most of the other four guys

140
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:03,423
The only part of the prison uniform he had to wear wear striped trousers his patients who weren't on convict

141
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
You could collect fees from

142
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
Being in San Quentin he had it pretty good but

143
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
Nonetheless he

144
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Just founded

145
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Enormously

146
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Oppressive

147
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
Was quoted as saying that he would um

148
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Rihanna

149
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
Perdigon to The Gallows

150
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
They just be I've locked up

151
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Going to sell for

152
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551

153
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
44

154
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,135
Chalfonte had a female admirer on the outside

155
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,695
Fighting press release by normal legal

156
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
But it was alleged

157
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
But she also try to get him out of prison

158
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
True less than legal

159
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
Someone slipped in

160
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Some

161
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447

162
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
The railroad ticket some money and some pistols

163
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,079
Bag of laundry and he snuck out with

164
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,127
The crowded visitors I'm taking the boat back

165
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
City

166
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,431
And before they noticed

167
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,271
He was gone he was I'm safely ensconced on a Utah boundary

168
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
The only reason he

169
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Hot

170
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
He disguised himself

171

The Whispers

172
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,183
But he was a meeting a

00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,695
But it must have felt kind of weird making vulcanite dentures

186
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
Enjoying my research

187
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
Guy found a directory professional men

188
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,071
San Francisco from the air

189
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
1890s

190
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,423
And there's a half-page in there on him and his talks about his

191
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Location

192
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
Experience in serving the

193
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Civil War

194
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,079
But it makes absolutely no mention of rubber dentures

195
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
Josiah bacon

196
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
Where did Vulcan

197
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:54,783
But this extreme case of anti patent troll vigilantism or cold-blooded murder of however you want to view it

198
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
Did have an effect

199
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
The Goodyear vulcanite Company stock

200
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,999
Apparently none of their employees was really young willing to

201
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,791
Take a chance of being shot by a dentist

202
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
And it's also the application that

203
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,143
Through this whole Venture Patton was going to

204
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
Josiah bacon

205
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
Project more than it was Major

206
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
Your policy the company

207
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
In the patent lapse

208
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,383
Most of the world forgot about Samuel chalfant

209
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
But the late 19th century Dental profession learn from their bitter experience and what they considered the vulcanite rubber pad

210
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
Reign of Terror

211
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,207
They collectively position themselves so that they could no longer be milked by any profit sharing patent holders

212
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:40,095
Many years later a similar scheme is put into motion to try to collect royalties for gold crowns

213
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
And the Dental Association killed it easily

214
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
Without firing a single shot

215
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087

00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,767
Rate by changing fanzine murder can be fun

219
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
It's not a website

220
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
Paper

221
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,887

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

239
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,079
A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

240
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:32,223
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

241
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,295
We're looking the part might cost you your life

242
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:40,415
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

243
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,767
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

244
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:49,119
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

245
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,727
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

246
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
Actually if I'm being honest

247
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,103
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing

248
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:05,503
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

249
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,831
Was found dead in my private gym

250
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,159
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

251
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:16,511
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

252
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,839
Now I need to clear my name

253
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:25,215
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

254
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
To find them
