I'm Roman Mars

29
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:38,048
Is today you pitch me the idea of the US Postal Service

30
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,376
There would be no way you can convince me that it could actually work

31
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,960
I mean it's up perfect as it is but the fact that you can put

32
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,800
49 cent sticker on an envelope and have someone deliver it

33
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,360
Across the country in two days

34
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
He's amazing

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
Just take a second

36
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:58,528
To imagine all the systems that have to work together to pull that off

37
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,136
Postal services around the world are pretty great

38
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,976
But with any complex design system there are failures that occur

39
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,792
Mail that never makes it to its destination

40
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,096
And can't be returned to the sender

41
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:18,240
And it's into this rabbit hole that producer Samara freemark fell when she began searching

42
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
For all the Lost mail

43
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
Once upon a time I lost

44
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,688
Something in the mail

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
Maybe this is happened to you

46
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
It probably

47
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
It has happened to you

48
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,392
But what makes my story different is that I went looking for what I lost

49
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
So you didn't come

50
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,768
And the place I ended up was

51
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
So strange

52
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
To dream Lake

53
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
Outside the box

54
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
Movie

55
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
But let me backup app

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,056
It was 2007

57
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
August

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,408
I was moving from Minnesota to Michigan to start grad school

59
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,760
I packed whatever couldn't fit into my station wagon into three cardboard boxes

60
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
And ship them parcel rate

61
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
Books mostly

62
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:10,208
The first box arrived at the leisurely Pace the book ship parcel rate usually do

63
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
And then

64
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
I waited

65
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:18,912
Four weeks the second box never showed though when I say that it never showed

66
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
I mean that most of the Box never showed a piece of it eventually did arrive it came in a large envelope

67
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:31,712
I need rectangle of cardboard the box top where I had written my address someone had taken a razor

68
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:38,112
Very carefully sliced it off the box and enclose note on Postal Service letterhead in Pharr

69
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,512
Remind me that my address label had become detached from my box and so I was thrilled when I came home one day

70
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
Months later and found my third box waiting for me on my doorstep my lost box was here

71
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,240
But something about the box was different

72
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:59,104
11 torn apart and then lashed back together with plastic zip ties

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
When I cut it open the cookbook side

74
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
Carefully packs were in disarray

75
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:10,112
My 4 inch thick hardcover Joy of Cooking have been torn apart down the spine like a weightlifter and used it

76
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
For some feat of strength

77
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,744
The two halves were sandwiched around the cookbook I have never seen before

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,583
Someone else's copy of Sophia Loren's recipes and memories

79
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,399
Sophia leered at me from the cover

80
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,703
Cleavage was distracting

81
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,007
I was perplexed

82
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
I told my mother about it

83
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,615
Oh yes she said that's happened to me too

84
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
She had shipped a box of books

85
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
Come from Europe and when she opened it

86
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:40,063
This box was filled with other people's things all from different countries

87
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,647
It had a Bible that was in Russian

88
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
A magazine

89
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
From

90
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,791
Germany it had some candy from the Netherlands

91
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
What's like everyone's European

92
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
I was

93
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Just

94
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
Astounded

95
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,239
My friend Helen had mailed some boxes

96
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,031
And she had a Story 2

97
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
When I got the box

98
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Does open

99
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
They looked like

100
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
They've been put in a washing machine

101
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Dried

102
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
Like the Box

103
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
Verso mutilate

104
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
And when I open them

105
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,831
The box with all the food Maggie

106
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
Half of the issues were

107
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Were taken out

108
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
The rest of the boxes were all

109
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
All like

110
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
Vintage cookbook

111
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
And in place of that

112
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
I put all of these

113
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
Southern home

114
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
Saturn have

115
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
I'm living whatever

116
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
Cookbooks from the 90

117
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
80s

118
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Deviled eggs

119
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,103
As though that was like a reparation

120
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
My loss

121
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,735
Helen and my mom shrug this off and they let things go

122
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
But it's not that me

123
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
Who was reading my books

124
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
Who's copy of recipes and memories

125
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
Guiding me through tiramisu

126
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
And just

127
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
2 head switched

128
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
Now if you ask enough questions like that you'll find yourself in Atlanta on a day so hot the pavement Shimmers

129
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,263
Driving past the Coca-Cola museum past the world's largest aquarium

130
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,663
Past the CNN headquarters and finally turning down the service road and pulling up in front of a nondescript sober

131
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
Bourbon Warehouse directly across from Six Flags

132
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Amusement park

133
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
The mail Recovery Center

134
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:25,023
Where lost mail goes to be sorted processed and sent back to its rightful owner

135
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
Or barring that

136
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
It's sold off

137
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,191
I walked up to the door of the warehouse and open it on

138
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:37,823
Opening bid $500 in auction

139
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591

200 people lined up in folding chairs

00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,247

142
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
And in the back

143
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831

00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
Stabbing at an auction list

159
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191

How much is that worth to somebody if it

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
Do yuan be worth nothing

167
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,695

186
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
Ricky and Cindy were hoping to get lucky

187
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,543
Today as lucky as they got once almost a decade ago right after September 11th

188
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
We got a whole boat

189
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
Oh American flags

190
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,551
You could not buy American flag know where in the United States everything was gone we ended up with American flag pins

191
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
American flags over time

192
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Earrings

193
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
We had 5 box

194
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
McDonald's

195
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
Little arches with American flag on it

196
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
McDonald's didn't have them

197
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,863
So wait wait wait come out smelling like a rose on that one

198
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
And just then

199
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
Gordon Plymouth

200
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,567
Swept out from behind the wheel of a baby blue 1960 Cadillac

201
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
Heads turn

202
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
People whispered

203
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,967
Mr Gordon was mail Recovery Center Royal

204
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
He was 80 years old with a pink face

205
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
White hair bright blue eyes

206
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
I swear he even twinkle

207
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,231
He didn't seem surprised when he saw my microphone it was almost like

208
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,583
She was expecting me

209
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,959
You come all the way down here from Brookland AR

210
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
So you didn't come here specifically to

211
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
Find out about the pot

212
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Quit the pot

213
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,223
Yeah yeah

214
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
Last Tuesday night

215
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
Of course he was

216
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
Mr. Gordon has been buying stuff here for 10 years

217
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,511
Takis Benz home and pack them and resell the contents

218
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,607
At the last mail Recovery Center auction he is bought a bin of painting

219
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,167
One of them was especially pretty

220
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
An orchid in a vase

221
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,543
He tried to resell it at a different auction for $25

222
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,079
But no one was biting

223
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
So

224
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
Will they put it back on my truck

225
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
And as they put it back on the truck

226
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,039
Chip dip and felt something inside the Box

227
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
Moving the frame was a box

228
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
Consult

229
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
So

230
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
One of the guys helping me

231
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
Took a screwdriver

232
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
The back off of it

233
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
And inside

234
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839
$5,000 worth of marijuana

235
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,495
Mr. Gordon and I sat and thought about what kind of person would send $5,000 worth of pot through the mail

236
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:55,103
And how that person must have felt when they heard about mr. Gordon on Leno

237
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
And whether they filed a claim for the painting

238
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:02,015
Or whether they were just relieved that the post office has lost its oh absolutely

239
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
But it couldn't be traced back

240
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
Original sender

241
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,391
And then mr. Gordon headed to the

242
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Florida bed

243
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
But first

244
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,023
He look deep into my eyes and he sang me a song for luck

245
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
Solomon

246
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:22,239
I'm in lobby in addition to being a mail Recovery Center celebrity

247
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Mariachi

248
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,055
At a restaurant in Alpharetta Georgia

249
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,615
You belong to my heart

250
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,663
Now and forever

251
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,599
And into this reverie walked Lionel snow

252
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
The director of

253
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,207
And Michael Miles postal service representative

254
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:48,863
Escorted me out the door told me I was violating post

255
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
Service policies

256
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
Post politics

257
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
Hawaii

258
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,943
Do I have to be I have to be like 50 feet from the center

259
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
And led me across

260
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
The parking lot

261
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,831
Here's what we would we would clearly be prepared to talk to you about

262
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,183
I thought you were going to walk around in here trying to get the ladle and see what

263
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:19,327
However whatever kind of documentation that you're trying to do inside that's where we run into a problem

264
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
Did he get security

265
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,215
That's that's among other issues but your security sign is one of them

266
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,103
That's that's nothing the critical issue

267
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
Critical issue

268
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
If it was you something I don't

269
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
Movies

270
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
There were 250

271
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:47,999
There's body parts possibly ashes and stuff to spend every year we would like to get things back to customers everything

272
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
But we're unable to

273
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
This sounded

274
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,679
Well to be honest it sounded troubling

275
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:01,823
Because if the Postal Service could accidentally sell $5,000 worth of marijuana to Gordon Clement

276
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,151
Didn't that mean that they could accidentally auction off

277
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
Those human remains

278
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Bashas

279
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Yeah

280
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,623
Set of small woman and acid wash jeans with frazzled hair standing behind me

281
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
My name is Joe

282
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,975
My fair lady I know bought dishes in a gray powder all over it

283
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,791
And when she finish unloading our dishes there was a

284
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
All the paraphernalia for somebody

285
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
You know Memorial it was actually 10

286
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
So that was funny

287
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
It was someone

288
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
Yes

289
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,287
Yes all over in cuz it was in the bottom

290
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:38,175
I wandered around the back of the building where postal officials were unloading bins with a forklift

291
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,015
Auction winners for queued up waiting to collect her purchases

292
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
One buyer was hanging two

293
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
Decide

294
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
My name is John Smith

295
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
I'm pretty sure that wasn't actually his real name

296
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,399
John came to the auction a lot he said and he specialized in buying book

297
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
He might have bought my book

298
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,031
Once Upon a Time jumbled up with thousands of others

299
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
He sympathized with my loss

300
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
He knew what it felt like he said

301
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
It just happened to him

302
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711
Let me tell you a really funny story

303
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,527
We should the case of us want him to us we bought books

304
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
And we got the same box taped up like it's been through the through a tornado and inside it was a bunch of

305
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
Screwdrivers and pliers

306
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,303
It was tools inside the same box nothing was said

307
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,351
Just he go here's your package

308
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
And they just replace it with

309
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,727
The same weight I guess with screwdrivers and Hammers and stuff but

310
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
My books were gone

311
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,359
Did you ask him what happened to they just what I don't know who got lost in the mail I guess

312
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
Poor Man cake

313
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:50,111
The auction was still going on inside but Ricky and Cindy that couple who had bought that thin of American flags back

314
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Back in the day

315
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
They were leaving empty-handed

316
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
Crazy

317
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:05,215
Some woman paid $50 for a box of VHS tapes what do you do with VHS tapes

318
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
I thought maybe was having money problems

319
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,383
There's nobody here got money problems today

320
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,015
I'm leaving I may not ain't nothing I can touch that I want it

321
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
I'm going back home

322
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,671
First of all we're going to go find lunch and we going home

323
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,487
I watch Ricky and Cindy Drive Away

324
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
I was hot

325
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,839
Sweaty almost in a daze longing for home

326
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,167
But before I left I turned and stood for a moment

327
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
And I watch

328
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,543
The river of other people's things pouring out of the loading dock and into truck

329
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
Send moving vans

330
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
Those clothes you should

331
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
Home from college and never saw it again

332
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,039
That fancy perfume your grandmother swore up and down she sent you for your birthday

333
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,135
The model Eiffel Tower that your dad says he are mildew from Paris

334
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,207
Your complete set of Southern Living cookbooks

335
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
The ones with the deviled eggs on the cover

336
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,839
All those things that you thought were lost forever

337
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
They're all here

338
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
They're all in Atlanta

339
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
Across from Six Flags amusement park

340
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,775
And they're all going home with

341
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Someone else

342
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
Hello

343
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,431
And then there was nothing left to do but get in my car and drive home

344
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
And when I got home

345
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,039
I made eggplant parmesan

346
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,879
You can find a good recipe for it on page 153

Bongs and Charter of our devices

357
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,263
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

358
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
