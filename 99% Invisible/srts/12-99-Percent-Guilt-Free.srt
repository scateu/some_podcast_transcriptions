Hard to sort of an emotional level it's really needed the first thing

35
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,280
Thanks forward you want to inspire people rather than

36
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072

I'm a designer

40

And part of the studio called Civil Twilight Civil Twilight Flagship project is lunar resident Street

41
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
Caesar street lights.

42
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
Sense and respond to ambient room lights

43
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
So they dim and brighten and respond

Solunar

00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
When the moon is folded in done to save energy

46
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
It's about the way of saving energy

47
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
And creating a new Urban connection

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
The cycle of the moon

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,584
The project on the 2007 Metropolis

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,144
Generation design competition partly because

51
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,472
Took this huge design challenge of trying to

52
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
Curb energy use

53
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
Added

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
A bit of the poetic

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
Design that saves energy but also

56
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,896
Expires and reconnects urban dwellers

57
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Was one of the fundamental

58
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
Cycles of nature

59
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,552
In most cities today the level of light pollution is so high that we're really not aware of

60
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
The stars are Moonlight at all

61
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:10,976
No no one knows what phase of the moon is on any given day, so we're looking for a way to really reconnect people to those kinds of Cycles

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
Each individual light is a very sensitive

63
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
The photo center

64
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Pics of moonlight

Lynn Spirit condition

67
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,960
So on the scale of acidity you could actually have really interesting phenomenon

68
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
If a cloud passed over the moon youku

69
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,568
Sort of shimmering across the city reflecting the

70
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
REI Seattle

71
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
Pretty amazing way to

72
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
Makes it is a whole lot more

73
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,272
More responsive inserted for more Dynamic and more life

74
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,368
Turns out that

75
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
In the early years of Street lighting

76
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Johnson Electric

77
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:45,024
Just electricity was really expensive so the only turn them on when they needed to

78
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,632
And they typically would not turn them on on the full Moonlight nights when it was clear at

79
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
People just had the understanding that that was enough

80
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,008
Light to see by Insidious and it was a waste of energy to the light on top of that

81
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,312
And that really change with the National Grid electric

82
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:02,688
Vacation in the 1930s when they actually needed a way to burn off excess energy at night when no one was

83
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,480
Would using electricity in their humps

84
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,808
And the street Light Grid actually be down as a way to do that as much

85
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
What is a way to

86
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
I sent that almost every city

87
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
To be illuminated

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
Very brightly

89
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Twenty-four hours a day

90
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
The standards for lighting that are in place

91
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
That. So this is an effort to make

92
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
Beautiful energy efficient

93
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
Version of a thing

94
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,263
Designed and used historically to burn energy on purpose

95
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,919
I think we've gotten used to talking about sustainability in terms of a lot of metrics and numbers and less about

96
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
People's direct experience of it

97
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
So we're looking at ways

98
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Is to really bring a

99
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,807
Tangible personal experience per level

100
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:45,183
We see ourselves as part of the stronger direction that the whole sustainability mooc

101
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
We'll go we believe in the coming years

102
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,559
So where's my friendly neighborhood Moon responsive street light

103
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
So far only exist

104
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
That's a prototype

105
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
So far

106
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,727
MIT labs are also prototyping a similar in

107
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
Spirit indoor adaptive lenses

108
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
Massive

109
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
Energy saving

110
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Technology

111
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,407
But also is a way to make our working in my room

112
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
It's more comfortable productive

113
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
And please

114
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
Do you say more natural

115
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
The flight

116
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,623
I think the lot of the current design discussion is about how to

117
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,951
Make design more relevant how to make it part of this process

118
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
It's the really shaped the world

119
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Economics

120
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
The government

121
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,119
I want to sort of processes that we don't think of being designs

122
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
Or having a relationship to design

123
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,215
Climate change is a design problem

124
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,823
National that is a design problem all of these things are our design problem two different ways

125
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
Expand the scope

126
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
How do you think about it a little bit

127
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Art challenge

128
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,271

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

135
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,679
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

136
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
That whines through a

137
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

138
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
We're looking the part

139
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
Might cost you your life

140
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,455
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

141
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,807
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

142
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,159
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

143
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

144
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
Actually if I'm being honest

145
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that

146
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,543
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

147
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,871
Was found dead in my private gym

148
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,199
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

149
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,551
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

150
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Now

151
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,879
I need to clear my name

152
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:29,023
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
