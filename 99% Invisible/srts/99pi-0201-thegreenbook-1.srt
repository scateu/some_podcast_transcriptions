This is 99% invisible

30
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
I'm Roman Mars

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,984
This is the American dream

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,032
Freedom on wheels

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,824
I know the movie Babe

34
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,408
Traveling on time-saving super highways

35
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,944
Futurama

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,808
The 1940s 50s and 60s were the Golden Age of road travel

37
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
Cars have become cheap and roomy enough to carry families comfortably for hundreds of miles

38
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,608
Bitter state highway system it started to connect the country smaller roads into a vast Nationwide Network

39
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:47,008
Finally Torres could make their way from New York to California with the windows down and the

40
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,288
Wind in their hair

41
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
See the Grandeur of America along the way we have become

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,272
Motorized Mobility

43
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,576
I never dreamed of before

44
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:05,184
But of course this freedom and Mobility wasn't available to everyone

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,280
That's a brand new producer and splash of cold water Delaney Hall

46
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:15,168
Because in 1956 the year that Federal funding made the interstate highway system possible

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
Jim Crow

48
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,240
Was still the law of the land

49
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,592
Racial segregation was enforced by law

50
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,664
And had been since shortly after reconstruction

51
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,016
In many parts of the north the codes were enforced in practice

52
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
And these codes could make a simple road trip really complicated for black Travelers

53
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
How is this

54
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,328
Is that a good level it's are you picking me up well there

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
This is Curtis Gray

56
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,776
Hey my name is Curtis Graves and I'll go in 1938 so I'm a little older than most of the people who are listening to this

57
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,152
Curtis would eventually become a Texas State representative

58
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
And then he'd go on to work at NASA

59
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
And then he become a photographer

60
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,600
What is a kid he grew up in the segregated South

61
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
And for many years

62
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
His parents tried to Shield him from that reality

63
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,560
I've often said that both my mother and father were the best lies that I knew

64
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,632
For instance we sat in the back of the bus

65
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
Because it was cooler there

66
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,240
We rode in the front of the train because

67
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,776
Are you could get off quicker

68
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,848
Wish that upstairs in the movie because

69
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,152
You had better seats in the upstairs

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
Of course that ruse can last

71
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,600
And by the time Curtis with a college senior in Houston Texas in the mid-1950s

72
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:42,208
He was fully aware of what it meant to be a black person living under Jim Crow

73
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
There's one experience in particular

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
That stands out in his mind

75
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,472
He was just 21 years old and getting ready to drive to a college meeting in Waco about 3 hours Northwest of Hughes

76
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,544
Degree to take a couple of acquaintances

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,408
They happened to be white women but I said to myself I might be in for some

78
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
Difficult times here

79
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,784
But you know I had to sold you on

80
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,696
To get to Waco Curtis had to drive to a stretch of East Texas that was Notorious in those decades for racial

81
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,303
Violence oh yeah those communities pretty bad

82
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,167
Around dusk The Travelers got hungry so they pulled over at a Roadside Diner

83
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
As soon as we got in the front door

84
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,567
The guy said I'm sorry but you can't come in here

85
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,383
We don't serve black people at all

86
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,735
So the three of them went back outside and Curtis devised the plan

87
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
They try another restaurant

88
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
Right across the street

89
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,415
I said to them the two of you go in get a table

90
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:49,023
And after you seated and the waiter or waitress comes up to you

91
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
Tell them that you have a boy

92
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
That's driving you

93
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,447
And that you want to know whether he can you can bring him in to eat

94
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,079
So the women walked inside and they asked the waitress of Curtis could come inside to join them

95
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
And ladies hit of course

96
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
No problem at all

97
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,967
So as long as I was that boy

98
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,527
And their driver I could eat

99
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
With them at a table

100
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
Vienna Restaurant

101
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,183
But if I were equal to them I could not

102
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:24,863
This kind of humiliation on the road was routine and had been going on for decades

103
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,447
Many people wrote Into the NAACP around this time

104
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Describing experiences

105
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
Just like curtis'

106
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
Don't make him CERN

107
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,895
Before starting my recent vacation trip to several eastern states

108
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,223
Yes sir I am a member of the NAACP

109
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
Anna Nicole

110
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,879
Incident occurring on January 1st at a gulf service station in Macon Georgia

111
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
I went to the restaurant to refresh my cell

112
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
Then found a vacant table

113
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,791
10 minutes passed and no one came to serve

114
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,423
He informed me that the restroom for the color was in the back

115
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
It seems to me

116
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,543
Dealer should not be permitted to sell gas and oil

117
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,359
And not provide these Comforts for us also

118
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,783
Some Travelers would drive all night instead of trying to find lodging in an unfamiliar and possibly dangerous town

119
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,855
They packed picnics they didn't have to stop for food

120
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:22,207
Some people would even carry portable toilets in the trunks of their cars

121
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,303
Knowing that there was a good chance they'd be turned away from roadside restrooms

122
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
But since 1936

123
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,215
A guy named Victor Hugo green I've been trying to help with some of these problems

124
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,799
Make life easier for thousands of black motorist

125
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,383
State-by-state they've been putting together a travel guide

126
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,223
Listings of restaurants hotels and Service Station

127
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,783
That would welcome African American Travelers

128
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
He called it the Negro motorist

129
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Green book

130
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
The green book

131
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
For short

132
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,631
Victor green who died in 1968 lived in Harlem New York during the height of the Harlem Renaissance

133
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,191
His apartment was not far from Duke Ellington

134
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,775
His office would eventually be situated near small Paradise

135
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
A famous nightclub

136
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,871
Richard and have the most obvious background

137
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
For starting a travel guide

138
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
Begin working tourism

139
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
He wasn't a writer

140
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
He was a mailman in Hackensack New Jersey

141
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,647
But he kept hearing stories about discrimination on the road

142
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
So he would

143
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,279
Go do his route in Hackensack New Jersey come back home and work on the green book at night

144
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,375
Compiling these addresses typing them up and put them in a book for

145
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,191
This is Calvin Alexander Ramsey

146
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
Playwright author and filmmaker

147
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
And years ago

148
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,079
Calvin started researching the history of the green book

149
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,919
He learned that the green book wasn't really the first guide of the

150
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Science

151
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
In fact

152
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527
Victor may have gotten the idea from Jewish travel

153
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,855
Because the Jewish Community was also having

154
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
Issues on the open road

155
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,463
It's a lot of places saying restricted

156
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
And it was a cold war

157
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
For Gentiles only

158
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,375
When Victor published his first green book it just covered New York

159
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:10,495
And he heard from around the country from other carriers and other people saying we really need this Nationwide

160
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,591
But it wasn't that easy to gather information from across the country back then

161
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
Long distance phone calls were expensive

162
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
And that Calvin says

163
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
Is when Victor green realized

164
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
That being a mailman

165
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
Was his secret superpower

166
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,159
There were African-American let it carries all of United States at the

167
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
This time we talked about 1936

168
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,023
And so he knew about you know

169
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,351
The relationships that the mailman have with their

170
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
Homeowners or apartment dwellers Delivery Man mail so just like today the mailman is part of the

171
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
The community

172
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
So Calvin says Victor tapped into the snap

173
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,663
Spreading the word about his guide through the National Alliance

174
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,711
The postal and federal employees

175
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
A letter carrier Union

176
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,319
Calvin says postal workers across the

177
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,671
The country scouted potential Green Book locations and their cities and towns

178
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,999
He says it's some even asked families they delivered to

179
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,071
If they'd be open to hosting Travelers in their home

180
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
And if they agreed then

181
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,447
They will send the information to Victor Green in Harlem

182
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,055
Victor was able to get a feel for us

183
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
Of letter carriers

184
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
Who are all over the country

185
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,735
Acquire material and names and addresses and businesses for him

186
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
Where were there was a black mailman

187
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
You got a green book salesman

188
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
Call recruiter

189
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
Pretty quickly the green book caught on

190
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,255
Businesses many black-owned began getting in touch with Victor

191
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,071
Hoping to advertise and hoping to be listed

192
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,631
Black newspapers signed on as sponsors

193
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,703
Victor eventually retired from his job as a letter carrier

194
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,007
And started working on the guy full-time

195
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
Even opened an Affiliated travel agency

196
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
Github Torres deranged traps

197
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,943
But still there was the challenge of distribution

198
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,527
How to get the Guide into the hands of Travelers who needed it

199
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,319
That happened in a few ways

200
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,391
United States travel Bureau signed on to help out

201
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
And then there would be more informal Networks

202
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
Spell churches

203
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,559
Pullman porters the Urban League NAACP

204
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
The Masonic lodges

205
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,703
There was a very wide very distribution

206
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
Process in place for these green book

207
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,823
And there was an important corporate sponsor to

208
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
A big one

209
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,783
Gas-X extra fine

210
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
DSS

211
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
Make

212
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,439
The Motoring

213
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,303
So also known as Standard Oil and now known as Exxon Mobil

214
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,703
Was one of the fuel oil companies back then then actively pursued Black customers they franchise their stations to

215
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
African American operators

216
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,799
And he had a black representative on staff

217
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
James billboard Jackson

218
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,919
Who helped plays Green books in many of those stations

219
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
As well as the white on one

220
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,527
Also may have done this out of a sense

221
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
The fairness and equality

222
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
Johnny Rockets

223
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
Who founded Standard Oil in 1870

224
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
I married into a family of abolition

225
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
Who were part of the Underground Railroad

226
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
And he voted for Abraham Lincoln.

227
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
And the day

228
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
But I probably did it for another reason

229
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
Until money honey

230
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
It has to do with money

231
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,847
Remember Curtis who had the crappy experience driving across East Texas

232
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
Just had operated

233
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,967
One of the first black-owned Esso stations in New Orleans

234
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
Where Curtis was born and raised

235
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
It was called the Bootsy and Buddies

236
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
The economic logic of stocking the green book was

237
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
Pretty simple he says

238
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:44,511
If you want black people to buy your fuel

239
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,351
Why don't you give them an opportunity to see that they can travel

240
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
And find places to stay

241
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
While they're on the road traveling

242
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,007
The Curtis's dad kept

243
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
A shelf of green book

244
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
Or his customers

245
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,127
You know if somebody came in and said no

246
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
Nobody on me

247
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,735
I'm thinking about taking a trip to Chicago my dad would say well

248
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:11,391
Yep do you know where to stop between here and Chicago and other person would say no say what happened

249
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Green book will tell you

250
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
And it gave you a sense

251
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
Security

252
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:24,191
Into the green book came to cover listings in all 50 states and even some locations in Canada the crib

253
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Being in Mexico

254
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,287
They printed about 15000 copies a year

255
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,895
Wintergreen head change travel for thousands of African-American Torres

256
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,223
He wrote in a 1956 introduction to the guide

257
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Now things are different

258
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
The Negro Travelers

259
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
Depend on the green book for all the information

260
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,159
This guy has made traveling more popular

261
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Without encountering

262
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Embarrassing

263
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,887
But as a civil rights struggle continued

264
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
Some people began to question the value

265
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
The green book

266
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,055
Black people many of them began to feel that this was

267
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
Accommodating to Jim Crow

268
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,687
Susan ruhe is a professor of history at Brigham Young University

269
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,271
And she says that the green book begin to seem a little out of

270
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
Step with the times

271
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,415
It really took on an overtly political Town especially in its early days

272
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
And they were actually other black travel guides

273
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,047
Published around the same time the Dead

274
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
One called travel guide

275
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Princeton

276
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,167
Travel guide listed where the n-double-acp

277
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
CP chapters were

278
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
In each City

279
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
They were much

280
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,055
More attuned with civil rights

281
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
Much more political tone

282
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,663
Eventually the n-double-acp made it clear

283
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,783
And the n-double-acp said what we're striving for it we're striving for integration

284
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
And so that's their stand

285
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:52,255
Sheepey built

286
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Based on race

287
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
An ended Jim Crow

288
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,095
Around this idea

289
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
Of total integration

290
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:02,239
In fact when the n-double-acp testified during the debate over the bill

291
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:06,591
They drew on all those letters they received about discrimination on the road

292
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,431
Appeal to that vision of the iconic family road trip

293
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,503
The freedom to explore America by car

294
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
Roy Wilkins

295
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,111
Defective Secretary of the n-double-acp

296
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
Spoke before the Senate Commerce Committee

297
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
In 19 6

298
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
E3

299
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,767
As soon as Congress gets out they're all going to

300
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,583
Heading to the station wagons and go back to their home just

301
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
Its July

302
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
In Washington

303
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
It's really hot

304
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,311
Will confess to send it to imagine what it might be like to travel as a black person

305
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,127
Would you like me to read what Roy Wilson said

306
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
How far do you drive each day

307
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:47,551
Where and under what conditions can you and your family eat

308
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
Where can I use a restroom

309
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,439
Can you stop driving after reasonable day behind the wheel

310
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
I must you drive until you reach a city

311
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,095
We're relatives or friends will accommodate you and yours for the night

312
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,423
Will your children be denied a soft drink

313
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
Or ice cream cone

314
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Because they are not white

315
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,335
Please appealing to them and they're at the most basic level of Their Own

316
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,383
Love for their own family

317
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,967
And Susan thinks this may have been one of the things that help

318
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
The Bell

319
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,551
By Framing the narrative

320
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
Of civil rights as a

321
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
Family Travel narrative

322
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
They were able to convince the

323
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
The Senators

324
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
About 4

325
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,095
In 1964 President Lyndon Johnson signed the bill into law

326
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02,303
The Civil Rights struggle was not over then it's still not over today but for Victor green it became clear at some

327
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,119
Some point that is green book had a limited shelf-life

328
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,679
He wrote in the introduction to one of his guy

329
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,727
There will be a day sometime in the

330
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
The near future

331
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
This guy

332
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Will not have to be

333
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
That is when

334
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
We as a race

335
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Privileges

336
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
United States

337
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
Ensure enough

338
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
2 years after the Civil Rights Act passed

339
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:27,135
The green book published its last Edition

340
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,463
Who actually could you just described where we

341
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767

4

345
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
Force down

And history and genealogy Department

348
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
And you have a stack

Of books are in front of you what are the who they are Green books

350
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,271
They're just little Jewels I mean I just

Spas with

352
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
This kind of

353
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Good energy that I do

354
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
I just feel like all my God they're at

355
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
Actually here

356
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
It's amazing

357
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
That's amazing

358
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,791
Can Daisy Taylor is a photographer and a cultural documentarian

359
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
The guy she's holding her small

360
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
Baby Baden

361
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
By 5 in

362
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
They have green covers

363
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,239
Each with a different destination featured

364
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,567
And there are pages and pages of listings inside

365
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
There were Beauty parlors

366
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
