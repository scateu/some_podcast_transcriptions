This is 99% invisible

19
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:14,240
I'm Roman Mars a couple of years ago we presented a story.

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
Play Peregrine Andrews about how certain sounds like the sound of skis on a cross-country track or hook

21
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:27,040
Horse racing track or Faked on Sports Broadcast it ended up being

22
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:33,440
Provocative episode over mainly because people really taken aback by the notion that any part of a sporting event

23
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,840
Might be fact that episode was just a small excerpt of a much longer documentary called the sound of sport

24
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
And we got a number of requests from the audience over the years asking where they could hear the entire piece and today my friends

25
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,640
We are going to present it to you in its full Glory this is a fascinating Exquisite Libre

Deep deep dive Amazon in sports broadcasting

27
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
I've never even considered before that's just one of the reasons why I love it keep in mind that was originally broadcast in twenty eleven

Proper Sports history contact

30
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,336
This is the sound of sport produced by Peregrine Andrews for fallen tree Productions and presented by Dennis Factor

31
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:33,600
I like listening to sports

32
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:44,352
I can close my eyes I can hear every single one

33
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:50,752
In my head

34
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
It's my belief that people have

35
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,528
Ingrained in them a memory of certain sounds

36
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,344
And if that sound is not

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,928
Field then the Mind knows that there's something wrong

38
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,840
There is an expectation of what foot

39
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
Ball sounds like

40
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,680
And it certainly wasn't vuvuzela

41
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,752
Plastic horns who's noise have been driving people mad

42
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,568
Just that continuous hum

43
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,408
Which action drowned out all of the meaningful noises

44
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,160
The sounds of the World Cup in South Africa in those damn vuvuzelas

45
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,560
How many people this was the first time they'd really thought about house Porsche sound

46
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,376
Please what I spend my life thinking and dreaming about

47
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,472
I'm Denise Baxter and I designed the sound of sports for television

48
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
Another 20 years I work exclusively on the Olympics

49
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
As their staff sound designer and engineer

50
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:06,016
I decide how to capture each event sonically so that it brings as much drama and excitement into the home is possible

51
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
Play getaway pause time Palace got a very good stop going to Texas and gearing up for London 2012

52
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
Is going to be a big job

53
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,047
I'll be using a team of 350 sound mixers

54
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,631
About 600 sound technicians in close to 4000 microphone

55
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,287
I told you

56
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
Bush born in Atlanta Georgia 1954 and essentially I think that I

57
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,295
I've been a sound person my entire life

58
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,951
When I was about eight or nine years old my dad bought me a cassette recorder and I was recording everything that I would

59
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
Going to the bathroom my mom would be on the toilet

60
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,815
And I'll just pop into the microphone start recording her

61
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:58,239
Michael had a restaurant and I washing off a lot of dishes when I was 14 years old enough money to buy a real drill

62
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:03,103
Recorder a thousand dollars at the time it was a staggering sum in 1968

63
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,919
This is the size of a big suitcase

64
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,343
Couldn't drive so I used to hitchhike and carry that recorded to the churches and to the high schools and record just about anything that I

65
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
I could possibly record

66
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:21,535
I was a veteran so I went to school on my GI Bill and study economics

67
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,399
Taught me a lot about borrowing money

68
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:33,055
So at the end of my college degree I had done my final papers on the recording studio and had convinced the back

69
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
To lend me the money

70
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,175
And before I knew it I was several hundred thousand dollars in debt

71
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,831
That recording studio dream is a misguided dream

72
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,927
You going to make your own music and live happily ever after and then all the sudden you

73
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,327
Struggling to get people things that you don't want to record and frustrated with the situation

74
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,847
What does minutes away from the first event on the ESPN schedule

75
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:13,247
1982 I found another and more profitable use them all your skills at the newly-formed sports television channel

76
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
ESPN

77
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,855
Set of musicians now is capturing the sound of car racing

78
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Tennis

79
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,951
Baseball football whatever they sent my way

80
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
Your majesty

81
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
I humbly ask you to the

82
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Where are the Olympic

83
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
Games

84
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
1948

85
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Open

86
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:40,127
That was the first Olympics to be televised by the BBC

87
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,455
The fewer than one hundred thousand homes had television the time

88
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Tavolo V

89
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
Best way to test false negative

90
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,415
And it's erections count toward the Finish Alexander sweet and wild in Spanish

91
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,999
Michigan here there is a much more than commentary to be hurt

92
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
Baptist and seventh nankivell

93
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:06,751
My own relationship with the Olympics began in 1992 when I was off with the first full-time job as a sound center

94
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,823
I went back and listened to every single sport

95
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
Trying to understand

96
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:16,223
Why we were covering the sports the way that we were what sounds

97
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
Were there

98
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
And

99
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
What sounds were really missing and why

100
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:26,975
I came from music I came from a recording studio and I want to apply those techniques and standards

101
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
To the live world

102
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:33,119
And one of the first things we implemented the Olympics with a lot more clothes Michael

103
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,215
This is where you put the microphone as close as possible to the Sound Source

104
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:43,103
If you use this technique you need a lot of microphone because each microphone can only capture a little piece of the whole picture

105
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,175
But you get more detail and definition

106
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
And a hell of a lot better sound

107
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,671
The parallel bars in the uneven bars for the women's gymnastics

108
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
When you put the microphones

109
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
That close to the athlete

110
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,303
You hear the flexing of the barn

111
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,655
You hear the breathing you can even hear the rustling of the clothing

112
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:32,767
My dad was variant

113
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,071
I rock and roll and he goes okay

114
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
I was just thrilled

115
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:41,215
Welcome Christmas mornings he got me a guitar and it was an acoustic guitar with a Chet Atkins record

116
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
And I love Chad axes to this day

117
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,871
What's the next 2 years after I got the acoustic guitar all I was trying to do

118
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
Was make it louder

119
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,063
National Lacrosse a contact microphone which is a device a microphone that you

120
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,903
You actually can stick right onto the top of the guitar to amplify

121
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:05,023
It takes up the actual vibrations of the wood and consequently the sound of the guitar

122
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
30 years later

123
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,775
I'm looking at gymnastics

124
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
The balance beam

125
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Is a synthetic

126
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
Resin type

127
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:27,551
Material that athletes they balance on they do summer songs they do

128
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,599
All kinds of routines on top of it

129
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,719
And I mean to balance beam assembly that has a certain resonance in there

130
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
Is it we cannot

131
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,583
Hear that someone probably has never heard

132
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,935
Is that a new texture that we should put into the mix and by the time we put

133
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
The contact microphones on there

134
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
He gave a new level of depth

135
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:52,639
Because the contact microphone hears the vibration in the entire bar

136
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,575
Giving the athlete on the bar and getting the death

137
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
And the movement

138
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
Roger Federer

139
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
Here we go

140
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,287
In 2008 the team responsible for the sound of the Wimbledon Men's final was nominated for bafta award

141
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
I love atmosphere

142
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
That is

143
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
My job as far as I'm concerned

144
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
It's the atmosphere

145
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
What you generate

146
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
Makes people

147
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Beaver

148
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,791
I'm bilston and I'm leasing supervisor

149
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
Who did the

150
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
Sound Foley 2008

151
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
Wimbledon Tennis finals

152
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Against

153
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
That's the sound of a moving

154
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Hush

155
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
The bouncing of the bull

156
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
On the course

157
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
Atmosphere

158
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Is

159
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,439
Sort of thing that I am trying

160
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
To bring into the home

161
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
When everybody is

162
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Fully expect

163
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
Something brilliant to happen

164
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Call Tina

165
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
Does lots of microphones on the court

166
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
Basically the

167
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
Courses covered

168
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,463
Very nice small

169
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Stereo mic

170
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
Stuck on the back of the course

171
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Just above the

172
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
Simple on judges

173
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Head

174
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,191
So they gave me cold is an interesting moment when they Shout

175
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
And there are other Motrin stores around

176
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
The course

177
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Youku

Surround technique

241
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,047
Well you have another need the crowd on the players in front of you

242
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,375
Crowd also goes all the way around the back of you so

243
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423

Play if you like

247
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591

You go to Split Second

274
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
The sort of sixth sense in a way

275
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
So I can

276
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Guess

277
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
Pretty much known entendre

278
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
What to do

279
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,367
Getting that exciting

282
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,743
Then this huge rule when it's old develop

283
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
Pretty wonderful

284
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
Of course given the context room tour

285
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,127
That would be the right time to sell your first Ace

286
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Dial now

287
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
With a second set point

288
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,063
What was brilliant about

289
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
That particular

290
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Final

291
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
Well they left

292
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Breathe

293
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
They didn't talk Oliver's all the time

294
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,399
I have had the number people say to me is there anyway that we can

295
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
Have a feed Willows commentator

296
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
I think that would be something that people would really appreciate

297
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
Because your income

298
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
Juices of the old school

299
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
Rotella compensated

300
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
I don't think many do now

301
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,183
I'm very Davidson few years have been a commentator on

302
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
Embarrass things

303
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,839
When a goal is scored

304
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
I would

305
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Just

306
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,471
Lycoming televised producer just 4.6 seconds

307
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,055
Why not the sound of the crowd and then they can come in

308
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,271
I used to try to make it

309
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,599
Fortune my mind that if you count for what to say say nothing

310
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,647
Which is the best policy

311
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
But

312
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
Environment

313
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:21,311
Euro 96 when Germany in the semi-final

314
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
I can remember very well

315
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
I would have thought

316
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
Something close to 10 minutes

317
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
The TV came out

318
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,807
Good sound from around the stadium

319
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,855
Just for the funeral

320
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
Observation the commentator

321
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:06,879
Everyone join again

322
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:13,023
The famous physician

323
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327

324
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,119
Only well noted at Freddy's

325
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
Puking baby on the way

326
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,359
What I'm trying to achieve but if you've got

327
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,151
A bunch of people sitting at home going

328
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
Donauschwaben

329
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
Terrific match

330
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
Isn't she psycho from the Santa Fe

331
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,063
But you know that's a summer

332
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Autofit

333
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:44,255
The football match what we do

334
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,327
Is to have

335
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
And then

336
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
12 mics around the pitch

337
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
Which you

338
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,215
Trailer down at the ball moves up and down

339
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
Another was chasing the ball around

340
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,567
So you can get the kicks from me

341
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,127
Definition of a shopping list.

342
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,199
The difficult technique to get across to people who haven't done it before

343
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,247
It's anticipating where the Bulls go

344
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,583
Personally I don't favor the system of fixed Michael

345
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,375
The bill describes

346
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:27,263
I prefer to use for roving operators who each point a directional microphone at the action

347
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
They follow the action

348
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,431
I believe this gives a better more defined kicks on and it's a method of use at the last four Olympics

349
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,247
And we use in London for the 2012 football dance

350
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,623
What you doing now is a game for the Athens Olympics in 2004

351
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,464
Live Olympic Games I try to rush up the excitement and entertainment.

352
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:24,096
And certainly winter sports are fun because you're trying to convey a sense of speed and motion

353
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,192
I've always enjoyed the sound of bobsled

354
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,568
Vancouver there were 44 cameras

355
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,968
At each camera position there was a distinctly different oral perspective and I was trying to put

356
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,040
The view or The Listener in the place of the athlete

357
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,648
And I made every camera position

358
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,928
A sound Zone

359
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
Some people may say

360
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,168
284 microphones

361
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
What is a bit excessive

362
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,264
But you have to remember that every camera

363
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,824
Perspective every visual perspective

364
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,920
For the viewing audience has a different sound texture and a different sound

365
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:43,456
It's like a piece of music that you just sit and listen to the crowd

366
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,528
You here like how it swells and Dives and

367
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,576
Peaks and then suddenly burst

368
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:54,976
Sounds to me like an orchestra

369
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
I'm Rob Nokes

00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
I mean

371
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,656
Sound effects recordist for movies in Hollywood

372
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,496
I get hired by the movie studios

373
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
2

374
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,128
Record sound specifically for their movie for example if you have

375
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,664
Pacific sports movie

376
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,760
Be a horse racing hockey figure skating football basketball

377
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
They bring me into

378
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
Capture the essence

379
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
The crowds

380
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
And the game itself

381
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,672
The sound of the basketballs

382
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
The sound of horses

383
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,280
Does Hooves horses breeding players tackling each other

384
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,864
So they bring me in so that they can recreate

385
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
The feeling

386
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,704
Have being really into that event when you see the movie

387
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:44,128
The game of their lives it was the greatest team in any sport I have ever seen

388
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,504
The game of their lives as a football movie about the 1950 US men's

389
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,832
National soccer team that was competing in the World Cup

390
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
In Rio

391
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:54,880
In Brazil

392
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,184
And they went on to beat England

393
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
Which was shocking at the time

394
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,280
Because England was the best team in the planet and

395
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
America was probably

396
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
What are the worst teams

397
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,424
I was asked to go down the record football crowds

398
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
For the movie

399
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,288
In North America we don't have football cards that are that exciting

400
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
And

401
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
Rambunctious

402
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,408
I went to Brazil and I recorded

403
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,712
Football games I went to murambi

404
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:23,040
Stadium to record a game between Brazil and Bolivia

405
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
And the crowd was

406
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
Insane

407
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,352
I was just your move around stadium and listen for pockets of

408
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,656
Chanting and cheering or loud fans

409
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,448
And listening for the energy

410
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
They are

411
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,920
Out of their mind singing

412
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,712
Huge 10-foot drums

413
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,512
When you can feel someone screaming in

414
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,816
Their guts are coming out as they're yelling

415
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,632
That's going to translate when you hear it in the movie

416
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:13,216
I'm looking to record people that are really passionate and Intuit

417
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,264
And so I would set up near them

418
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
I had a handheld recorder

419
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,128
I try to not let them know I was recording

420
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
So I didn't want to change their

421
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
Performance

422
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,536
Do you have people in the loop group will actors

423
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:42,400
They're not going to go that deep and scream like a fan in an audience will

424
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:49,056
It's amazing when you can recreate with real people that energy that's the way to do a sports movie

425
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:02,624
Sound puts you in the actual environment and it really does create an emotional response

426
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:10,304
My name is Gordon Doherty I am the studio audio director at Electronic Arts Canada

427
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,632
Pacific 3D Sports video game end of the company

428
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,704
Play games like a FIFA hockey

429
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
Soccer

430
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,520
American football

431
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,080
Golf pretty much the entire range of sports

432
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,176
We're taking

433
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,504
A scientific approach to a very emotional process which is

434
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
Directory analyze how crowd

435
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,184
Set up this big boss of sound everything is happening at once

436
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:42,560
Is that guy in the corner that whose face is painted purple and he's got his team shirt on

437
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,400
He's got a big drum and he's trying to get his corner of the stadium.

438
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,192
Maybe a wave starts

439
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,984
Around the state or maybe it doesn't

440
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
So

441
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,336
You are future pushes let's get into actually modeling

442
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,128
How crowds behave

443
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,176
And how these different

444
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,968
Particles of sound actually interact

445
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
Decorate a large bag

446
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
We work a lot

447
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,744
How can we keep improving

448
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,536
The actual game experience

449
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:18,400
We try to bring it down as authentic as possible but then we have to go beyond

450
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,448
Because normally you would not share

451
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
What are the details of the sound on the pitch

452
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
On TV

453
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,336
But of the game so you expect

454
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,696
Butterfly South African World Cup

455
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,000
Retired people in South Africa record

456
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
The crowds

457
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,584
We have to build a game quite a few months in advance

458
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
Abby event

459
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
Beehives going on

460
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:06,272
What is this

461
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:09,344
The thing is it's part of the EU have to have this was not authentic

462
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
3 actually put

463
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,976
A mute button on finally say that you can eat it or or lower the volume of it

464
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:19,584
And then when the actual World Cup start in South Africa

465
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,424
How come the TV channel catches put a mute button like they do in the actual video game

466
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
He's another one of my favorite sports

467
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:39,040
Is a great example of Greeley trying to isolate the micro sounds of the spa

468
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:44,672
Really separate the above sounds

469
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,256
In the swimming hole in the below sounds the underwater sound

470
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:54,656
Really conveys the sense of a focus in the sense of isolation of

471
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
The athlete

472
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,752
Your microphones on the handrails

473
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
Divers walk up

474
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:05,408
You can hear their hands you can hear their feet you can hear them breathing

475
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,072
We have a microphone at the bottom of the pool

476
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
Under the water

477
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:30,496
We actually goes under the water we shifted perspective to just them in the underwater sound you hear the

478
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
Bubbles

479
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:36,640
You get this complete sense of isolation complete sense of the athlete

480
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:42,016
All alone

481
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
Archery

482
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,232
I like the sport

483
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,512
After hearing

484
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,328
The coverage in Barcelona the 92 Olympics

485
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,400
They were things that were missing the easy things were there

486
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,704
All the sudden impact of the target

487
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,800
That's a no-brainer in a little bit

488
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,384
Show The Athlete is there getting ready but probably goes back to

489
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
The movie Robin Hood

490
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
I have

491
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,248
A memory of the sand

492
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
And I have an expectation

493
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,624
So I was going okay what would be really really cool and archery

494
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
To take it up a notch

495
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
And the obvious thing was

496
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:25,280
The sound of the arrow going through the air to the Target

497
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Lipozene

498
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,912
So we looked at a little thing the color boundary mic

499
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,984
They would lay flat or sliders in a pack of cigarettes

500
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,592
Apollo windshield on it and I'll put it on the ground between the athlete and the target

501
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,920
Hey it completely opened up the sound to something different

502
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,680
For some reason directors don't like to see the microphone

503
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,472
They do like hearing good sound

504
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,264
There is a resistance

505
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,312
Can actually see microphones in the picture

506
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,896
Which is one of the challenges that we have in the boundary microphone

507
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
I feel that challenge because youku

508
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,736
Creep the microphone closer to the ax

509
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
Source

510
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,856
That's the lineup The Boat Festival in

511
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
Landfill

512
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Straight

513
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,488
The umpires being Donnie came down about the car tomorrow to go

514
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,536
To line up the acoustic version

515
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,632
The engine of the lawn to start it up

516
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
I want if you can have them on this

517
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,968
Will we find ourselves on a glorious day down on the Thames of the boat race

518
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
Absolutely

519
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,040
Pool Davis

520
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,856
Executive producer with BBC sport look after

521
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,160
Tennis Rugby Union

522
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
Boat race

523
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
A few other things

524
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:04,096
Sound is it's a hidden Jewel isn't it really I mean I think it's one of those things that one take

525
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
Facebook granted

526
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:08,704
Because strobis reasons you can't see it

527
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,008
No one should refer to it when it goes wrong

528
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
There is literally at at

529
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,568
The deathly silence

530
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,872
I'm a huge supporter of sound

531
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,920
In outside broadcast television

532
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,992
And I think the guys that we would with Rudy respect that

533
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,744
My anxiety James on the science advisor

534
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,560
We're at the end of the bike race at Putney and

535
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
My job is fat

536
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,656
Open to seeing

537
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
With what you hear

538
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:51,200
Whenever I look at a shop I want to try on best rate with us and that that's what was my inside pool cuz already

539
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:57,600
Ritika short of the cruise then you can see the looks on their faces I want to hear every bit of effort that pussy into that

540
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,672
I had to make sure every show

541
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
Who cuts up

542
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,744
We can match you excited to make it even better

543
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,072
Give up the old sleeps

544
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,400
Boathouse is Anais love balcony that's great clip

545
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:17,568
Quite often a lot of the motivation for directing outside broadcasted is visually driven

546
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,128
Nothing I can come from sound as well

547
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,920
If we have two very

548
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
Motivated Cox's

549
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:26,528
And that both Mike topping that delivering some outstanding

550
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Sound

551
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:31,136
Then this real motivation 8 to hit up sound to understand

552
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,928
What bad delivery instructions

553
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
Enwisen

554
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
Atmosphere as well

555
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:41,376
Octonauts usually most amazing and Sons a going visually to that cameras to see the Colts

556
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,936
Delivering it and then how the roads are overreacting

557
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
Intuit as well so

558
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,544
Those motivational reasons for hearing sound all things great

559
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,592
Rather than it just being wallpaper

560
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,432
Passing the boat house and now we're just going to take the outfit strike

561
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
1

562
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
3

563
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,464
Bleeding through GOG but again

564
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,144
3 + 4

565
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:20,800
On the boat race we've got about six different show signs within the course with you the moment we choose

566
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
Weather

567
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:28,480
And we've got various stereo effects mine something in the toe pain and then as we move from site to site moving down the car

568
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:33,344
We have effects Mike's Adit raiderlink back to us here where I can mix them in

569
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,368
Mind science

570
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,440
Wheels that have mics on the crew boats themselves

571
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,720
And on the choice votes

572
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
So

573
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,280
We can pick out the various different

574
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,840
Effects that we need has the best movies of down the river

575
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:50,496
But time has come

576
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,688
We saw the first off the broken will be a presentation element when the

577
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:02,016
Provinces will be introducing what's going on February movie with us

578
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:07,136
And this is the time that time good afternoon it's just going to be online

579
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:13,536
What's the first element

580
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
Itself and I'm basically moving

581
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,120
Sandestin restaurant

582
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
Starting

583
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,960
Just give us five minutes Joe

584
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,776
Vitamix and SKF

585
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,872
I'm starting from rest and then., Coventry mic stand with end

586
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,712
Is so important Hospital code 600 more to come but the first one is

587
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
The platform

588
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:37,856
Ferris High distance effects might one up on The Voice which gives it to panoramic view of pain today

589
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:50,400
Then we move on down tools Ultimate Fighter 41 by now or into Mike's in the boat has themselves

590
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,216
You're not ready

591
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,288
Cambridge Health Douglas box again

592
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:02,944
Family Clinic in 2 the races health science of the race time we go to unpause but at the end Pockets the race.

593
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,184
Tennessee sells mr. affects mods. Hopefully pick

594
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
Cut the sound of the rowing

595
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,936
Peacock says only boats have on them

596
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,208
Sometimes the language that comes from the talk season 4 Constable so we have to have no tentative

597
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:50,048
I'm not part of the life cycle workout

598
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,608
What does the saying is it transmittable

599
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,936
Benevolus what we're saying is it really good information

600
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,736
Turn on the fan

601
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,416
Battery saver on

602
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,016
Then we're into the berry show sites

603
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,040
Said Sana.

604
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:48,672
15 Titus down there actual sites which will be able to pick out the crowds that are late for the washing

605
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,536
The birds are places on the right state of color because they're all having parties

606
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
Prevent throwing up

607
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,800
The multi-layered

608
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,824
Oral picture

609
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:12,736
Heading towards Victory Arizona

610
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,048
Alternate tunings behind

611
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
Problems by

612
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,680
Max Gundam temperature of 1 K me to one by

613
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
Two and a half lengths

614
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
Okay

615
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
At 1

616
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,848
The boat race of 1933

617
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:46,016
Cambridge still with a slide

618
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:52,416
A suspect

619
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:56,256
Way to UNCC vertical the race you'll see the stars with initials somewhere in between

620
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:01,632
What we can do you think she can buy an atmosphere throughout the whole race for the view ICU and she done much better experience

621
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:08,288
In 2011

622
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:14,688
The spoils everything

623
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,760
Cambridge

624
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,720
Things to know about layering

625
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,304
With pictures there's a degree of layering but it's

626
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,376
Spell Eclipse. Little cutting between pictures

627
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,192
With the sound I think you can build up the layers

628
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:48,480
Covering Anthems for example during six nations of whether you when you go to the anthem shorts of the teams

629
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,272
Are you tracking along

630
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:54,880
They close up to the players do you actually want to hear the choral singing of the stadium

631
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,672
What do you want to hear

632
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,256
It would respect the Fairly poor singing of the individual players

633
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,024
That's an interesting mix.

634
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
Sound guys have to deal with

635
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,352
Cuz you want the personality and

636
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,912
I know the words but often that

637
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
No son very well

638
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
But you didn't hear that sounds

639
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
The tool

640
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
Then you feel a bit cheated

641
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,856
Okay alright

642
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,904
When we do the rugby these days

643
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,696
We have a rigid Mike

644
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
Envy

645
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,488
Referee

646
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,864
He has refused to sit

647
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
With a radio mic

648
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,192
On the referee but it wasn't transmitted

649
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,216
Xiamen eventually

650
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,520
The Rugby Union officials

651
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
Sagittarius

652
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,616
Wonderful addition to the Coventry

653
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,664
That's what it is it's probably country

654
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,712
I don't think it had so much

655
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,504
Don't think you could use the

656
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
Technique for football

657
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:34,976
Take the hits please I'll contact you make sure you go straight to take the pic

658
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,840
What is your take on this side

659
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:56,479
So the addition of a microphone on the rug be rough trade open up another dimension

660
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,343
But she brought into the game

661
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
You can be the player

662
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:07,999
I believe that is the future sportsound microphones on the athletes and players themselves

663
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,047
If you can persuade them to wear them

664
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,703
And here's another sport that benefited hugely from this technique

665
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,567
Curling was introduced in

666
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,871
To the Olympics in 1988

667
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
When do the Winter Olympics went to Calgary

668
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,247
The rest of world on curling curling

669
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,135
How we going to make curly excite

670
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:41,535
How we going to introduce curling to the world end early on we started putting microphones wireless microphones on the curlers

671
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:46,143
Russell knows it's pretty big pocket you freeze in the back wheel nuts

672
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,543
Their strategy they are encouraging each other the talk in the console

673
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:57,663
There's a lot of screaming it's a very very vocal sport

674
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:03,039
Copper oxide sensor

675
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,087
It brings the intimacy

676
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,159
To the audience and it has really been a

677
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,487
A huge boost in the ratings in the interest in the sports

678
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,295
What's a video game interesting position

679
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,623
In that you are the player on the field

680
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:43,231
You're also the viewer of the game so you sort of in this weird place where

681
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,303
You're sort of a spectator but you're also an active participant

682
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:53,215
What we found with the sound is that we had to pretty much exaggerated

683
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,871
Princess on a boxing game you know we have to record the real boxes but we just don't get

684
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:03,455
Clean sound to get like things like Grunts and groans and punches and impact

685
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:09,855
Thought we go into a studio and sometimes will we create a boxing ring to do the defeat in the Falls

686
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,159
And then what we'll do is we'll close mic

687
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:17,791
It's called a Foley artist it's basically the people that do the footsteps and all the sort of hand props and everything

688
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,583
Fortuna television

689
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,679
We'll have the person that punch a punching bag or side of beef or whatever

690
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,751
And just get all of the actual punch sounds

691
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:31,103
The high low medium hard different angles

692
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:42,623
Still at the boxing sniffs and all the grunts and groans and we've been will do things like you know break celery and Larry didn't to

693
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,695
A body impact sounds get like a cracking rib type of sound

694
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,399
So all of those elements weed

695
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,959
Cheerfully craft in a studio environment

696
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:02,079
And then

697
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,615
Crossing the venues and

698
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,639
Dress it all up

699
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
The whole

700
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:09,759
Net effect of that is that it does feel fairly authentic

701
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:25,119
Legendary

702
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:31,519
On the tennis game how Grand Slam Tennis

703
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,543
From the French Open

704
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,359
Similar I got some tapes from Wimbledon as well

705
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,175
Number of matches with different players

706
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:43,039
And different sizes of venues and just basically extract the crowd from there

707
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:49,439
Anvil Mcenroe or the William sisters and shrieks and screams at tennis players do

708
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:05,567
I think it was Venus said wow you know it sounds just like me serving

709
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,879
15

710
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:25,535
American car racing they call it NASCAR

711
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,119
This particular race was a half mile oval

712
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,399
And essentially

713
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,191
What would be considered a

714
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,983
Football type Stadium

715
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,519
With very high banking

716
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:42,175
The cars put out a hundred forty decibels of sound maybe more than you put 40 of those cars on a half mile

717
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
Call track

718
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,759
And it just sounds like a hornet nest

719
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,831
There's no real definition

720
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:55,231
Then I was in the show is over and they're supposedly is the Roar of the crowd

721
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:59,071
But the producer screaming hot I can hear the cry. Near the crowd

722
00:46:59,327 --> 00:46:59,839
Is a

723
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
Drake basic

724
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
Physics

725
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
Issue

726
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:07,263
The sound that I want are being Master being drowned

727
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,287
Buy these cars

728
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
Learn my lesson

729
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,383
I went back

730
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:18,783
To my home studio and I started pulling up some crowd samples and building different textures and things like that

731
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,647
So my next race yeah when they show the crowd that start sneaking some stuff in it

732
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,183
And when it came to the end of it

733
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,487
There's a very very nice crafts with

734
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:34,399
And the same producers that you know

735
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:38,751
How to get the atom away so you know this is great this is what I want this is what we're trying to achieve

736
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,311
And then a week later he found out that I use this amp

737
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,359
And then I get a call if you're cheating

738
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,151
XHamster

739
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,431
All right

740
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,455
Who am I cheating

741
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,247
Am I cheating the audience

742
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,295
Know the audience sees

743
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
The crowd

744
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,855
The audience has certain text

745
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,903
Muttations you see I cry You Hear My Cry

746
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:04,607
There's some sports that she just cannot

747
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,143
Capture the nag

748
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,751
Cross country skiing biathlon his another one

749
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:16,639
How because of the size of the course and this has been further complicated because it's the camera lenses have gone up

750
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:22,271
Honor 10 Hunter 2000 3842 1 these cameras are able to see

751
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,343
A half a kilometer maybe McClung on the course

752
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,159
And how do you replicate that sound

753
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,231
Essentially if you got cameras that are

754
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,815
That far apart from each other you're putting 20 or 30 microphones

755
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
To feel

756
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,887
Is the athletes are coming to you

757
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,911
Which is not

758
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:44,287
I am not a purist whatsoever in sound production

759
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,567
I truly believe

760
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
Then what

761
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,383
Ever the tool takes

762
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,223
To deliver a high-quality entertaining

763
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,247
Soundscape

764
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,527
It's all fair game

765
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:58,111
And that has caused some issues because I use samplers

766
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,903
What a sampler is

767
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,207
It's a keyboard is attached to

768
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,511
Cecily a digital recorder

769
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,071
When you hit the key on the keyboard

770
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,351
It triggers

771
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,375
The sound

772
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,911
Add to playback

773
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:15,007
And with the keyboard also triggers with sensitivity

774
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,055
Means that if I hit the key

775
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,079
Real hard

776
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:22,175
Don't have a little bit more of a heart attack and you can vary the pitch

777
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,735
If I hit the Cenote that has a stamp

778
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:28,831
And then I hit a d note of the same sample it will be upstairs

779
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,367
Sofas and get there

780
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:48,799
Rick Craven pension still hold the lead the French in third we could do without saying never a mother

781
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,383
In Atlanta one of my biggest problems was rehling

782
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,711
Rowing is a 2km course

783
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,735
They have

784
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,271
For Chase boats

785
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,831
Following the rowers and they have a helicopter

786
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,391
That that's what they need

787
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,183
To deliver the visual

788
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
Cover job

789
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:10,303
Okay but the helicopter in the chase boat just completely wash out the Santa

790
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,351
Don't no matter how bad the microphones are

791
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,167
You cannot capture you cannot reach

792
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,983
And isolate sound like you do

793
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
Visual

794
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
But people have expectations

795
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,847
Okay if you see the rollers

796
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,407
They have a sound that they're expecting

797
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,687
So what do we do

798
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:35,135
That afternoon we went out on a canoe with a couple of rowers and recorded stereo samples of the different

799
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:39,487
Type of effects that would be somewhat typical of an event

800
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:47,423
And then we loaded those recordings into a sampler and play them back to cover the shots of the boats

801
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:54,847
Australian something back from Great Britain

802
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,479
Standby

803
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,527
Under a sink

804
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:08,927
Good evening spatula Victoria sponge has dropped back to last 31st to begin on the Plaza

805
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:15,327
Side is dancing shoes out there in the early stages going fast to is what we doing who's racing you looking to get somebody run

806
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,119
Around the pool softer the horses

807
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:23,007
Sno-Way on occasionally you will come across pretty close up pictures of the horses of the Pharcyde

808
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,055
Which is done off one of our driving cameras

809
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,079
What you have

810
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,615
Engine noise in my case

811
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:33,247
So that's why you wouldn't want to microphone on that cuz I'll leave it here is it called reading out when they come around cussing

812
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,295
Basically

813
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,087
The way you cover all that sort of stuff

814
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,135
Is to run a tape

815
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:42,207
Which has the sound of horses galloping

816
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,511
Which is actually if I remember rightly

817
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:50,911
A slowed-down buffalo charge

818
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,983
If that doing hurdles she will have

819
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
At 8

820
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,031
Which has

821
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:02,431
The sound of somebody falling through hatch

822
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:07,039
Through or over hopefully the Huddle UIC fade this up

823
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,575
Show you

824
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:12,415
Very level a little bit so it sounds like several of his going through together

825
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:19,071
That's pretty much

826
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:22,655
Start playing the same recorded Live use for you

827
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:32,895
Some horse racing events sound strange to me cuz they have this constant thundering sound and I can't tell if it's real or not

828
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:38,015
It's like in horse racing movies like

829
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:44,671
Seabiscuit and all hat you can hear the jockeys yelling and screaming at each other when they get

830
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:51,327
On a turn you hear the whips gone

831
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:02,079
I recorded an Arabian horse

832
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,895
Arabians have a different gate than thoroughbred

833
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:09,247
And I put for wireless microphones on each hoof

834
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:14,367
We wanted to control the speed of the horse so

835
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,439
We had the trainer run the horse in a circle

836
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,207
With a rope

837
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:24,607
We want to control the movement cuz we have $12,000 in gear on the horse

838
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:30,751
He did take one microphone off

839
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:38,943
Being charged for the sound of a real event

840
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,063
I would want to do like the Kentucky Derby and use microwaves around the track

841
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,111
And have some on board mics

842
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,391
And then have

843
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,159
Mike's

844
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,439
In the crowd

845
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:56,095
And have Mike's on the gate

846
00:53:56,351 --> 00:54:02,495
Horse racing fans bigger

847
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,031
It really crazy when they're cheering

848
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,823
Those people are yelling

849
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:12,223
They're like screaming at the top of their lungs and yelling

850
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,463
60

851
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,071
Stop Google. Fun so you know we like to have fun as well the same

852
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,911
So what we do is we use the real sign of the Dawn

853
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,959
Hitting the ball to trigger some samples

854
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:39,615
And we play around with Kick Drum the snare drums been spoiling everything else we can find an 8-8 just

855
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:42,687
A bit of fun ready to what kind can I get a bit repetitive

856
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,831
125

857
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,391
It's not real but it's not on

858
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:54,463
That's something that I think most of us involved in sport

859
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,767
Trying to try and humps the experience

860
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,863
We tread the Middle Road between what's real and what's unreal

861
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:07,775
If you're sitting at the side of a basketball court from the TV point of view

862
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:12,383
The Producers want to hear the ball as it goes through the net the swishing of the net

863
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:19,551
And that's certainly something that you do not ever hear in the basketball arena do you only hear that on TV because

864
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
This exciting

865
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:26,975
Samuel L Jackson became tfboys and you became men

866
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:30,047
Coach Carter

867
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:34,143
For a Coach Carter the supervising sound editor wanted me to get the sound

868
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,935
Of the basketball

869
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,959
But he wanted

870
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,775
There's a pain I don't know if you ever heard of basketball

871
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,055
When you bounce it goes

872
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:41,823
Bounce

873
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,615
It kind of has this

874
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,895
Hi Arie ring

875
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:48,735
We did this great room stuff like Rim slams Rim head

876
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,807
Net wishes and then we're trying to capture the sound of the

877
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,855
This pain and we are right under the net

878
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:59,231
And I'm like no that's not it it just sounds like the big side of a basketball and the Reverb in the room

879
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,303
But then we went into the corner of the room

880
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,119
And I got elevated on the bleachers

881
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:11,775
And iPad my microphone above the ball and the guy slam the ball on the ground and then as the ball was coming up to

882
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,311
To my microphone you hear that

883
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,079
The Ping

884
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:23,039
I've always taken the approach to record the sound

885
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,343
Documentary-style like accurate

886
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,159
And then I tried to then find the next level up

887
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,695
To go hiking reality

888
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
Sometimes you actually have to

889
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,535
Cheetah sound even bigger to make a cake

890
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,303
Cut through

891
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,375
The thing that Hollywood does differently is

892
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,911
It sounds huge

893
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,983
The movie sound big they sound rich

894
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,031
It's definitely more the app

895
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,055
Patrick old and real

896
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,847
Just think Fast and Furious order

897
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,871
Die Hard

898
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,991
As we've been doing this over the years sort of emulating broadcast and enhancing a

899
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,575
The broadcasters have been listening to what we've been doing

900
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,599
And

901
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:00,159
Then using our techniques back

902
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,695
In the actual broadcast

903
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,119
Broadcast

904
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:20,383
Push up the witches on the bats what they do now

905
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,175
You know when you listen to a baseball game

906
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,967
Now versus 10 years ago

907
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,879
Because they have mic located very close

908
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,159
Capital sound

909
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:36,255
Many years ago the Olio that people would have been used to

910
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,071
Expecting from the Philippines

911
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,631
Where I can I expect to hear every kick

912
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,655
Every grunt

913
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,191
Every whistle referee

914
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:48,287
Cuz that's what they get used to hearing on video games on films of being posted

915
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,103
So we're always trying to match my Solace and

916
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:01,599
The challenge for me to make sports on TV is engaging is filmora video game

917
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
If we don't

918
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647

919
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,695
But it's a challenge I welcome

920
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:10,559
I'm gearing up for London 2012 for the games we presented in high definition picture

921
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,351

925
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,079
Cuz I hear that the boo boo zoo was

926
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,359

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

934
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:31,199
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

935
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
