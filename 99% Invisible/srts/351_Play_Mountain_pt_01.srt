1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
This is 99% invisible

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,072
I'm Roman Mars

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
You may have seen the noguchi table coffee table

4
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Movies or TV shows when they want to show that a lawyer or an art dealer is really sophisticated they play

5
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,200
Put on a Gucci table in there waiting room

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,760
It is really a beautiful table

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,320
Too curvy wooden legs interlocked

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,880
And support this heavy slab of glass

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:32,000
It seems like it's almost floating above them last reporter Jackson Roach

10
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:38,656
Noguchi coffee table was introduced in 1948 it's become one of the emblems of mid-century Industrial

11
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:45,056
Design it has its own Wikipedia page and there's a thriving Instagram hashtag hashtag FYI

12
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:49,152
MCT which stands for your noguchi coffee table

13
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,432
Which basically means

14
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:53,248
Pure bougie cliche Interiors

15
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,600
Which is ironic because like all eventual cliches

16
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
New Gucci himself

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,160
Was quite

18
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:00,928
Avant-garde

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
Noguchi was a prodigy

20
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,256
The sculpting prodigy

21
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,560
Isamu noguchi was a Sculptor

22
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,864
And he was so much more than that

23
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
Choreographers

24
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,984
And fashion designers and art directors

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,848
SNL whole lot of different people across a really wide creative SWA

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,176
Look taniguchi as a point of inspiration

27
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,712
This is bacon heart

28
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,552
Senior curator of the isamu noguchi foundation and garden Museum

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
Noguchi himself built this studio in Queens

30
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,184
How's a lifetime of his abstract

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,744
Evocative experiments in stone and Metal

32
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,816
Princess noguchi was challenging himself

33
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
With every sculpture

34
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:45,216
Can I make something hard feel soft can I make something heavy feel like

35
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,800
Can I make something far away feel like it's right next to you

36
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
You know how to make rock

37
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
Feel fluid that way

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,760
Noguchi sculptures seem to twist and balance on themselves

39
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,576
Undulating with form and texture

40
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
But this is all his later work

41
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
Back in the 1930s

42
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,768
Before noguchi you had a signature Museum and a namesake coffee table

43
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,328
He was a struggling artist in New York City

44
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,888
We pay the bills by sculpting busts

45
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Rich people

46
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,984
He called it head busting and he did it just to make money

47
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:23,360
Or he said he did it just to make money but in truth he used it brilliantly is a way to Social Network

48
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,200
And it was a way to romance the people who were his patrons

49
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,296
He was as great a networker as he was a Sculptor

50
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,112
Head busting wasn't exactly

51
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
The feeling

52
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
Do you want to think bigger

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,232
Here's noguchi in an interview from the 70s

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
The 1930s

55
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Having done

56
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,168
Some more heads and being disgusted

57
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
Doing heads

58
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
Decide to get away you know

59
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
Another dimension

60
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
That was the same thing that makes us go to the Moon

61
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Desire to get away

62
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,296
If you wanted to make art that would live in the world

63
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,624
I just in a rich person's home or on a gallery wall

64
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,208
You wanted to change the physical landscape that people moved

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
Gucci said that he wanted people

66
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,560
To feel like the first person on earth

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
The first person to explore

68
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,496
And so he's hard to think of a concept for a giant public sculpture

69
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
It looked like a massive

70
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
Massive

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Pyramid

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
Imagine across

73
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
Between a Mayan temple

74
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
Gander Mountain

75
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
Pushing up out of the Earth

76
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
With a long slide slipping down it

77
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
Steps on two of its faces

78
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,720
It is it is a step pyramid essentially but on each side the steps are different heights

79
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
And they were regular very symmetrical

80
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
But it wasn't just a sculpture for a museum or a

81
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Bank Plaza

82
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
Noguchi thought of it as a playground

83
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
He called it

84
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Play Mountain

85
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:01,152
So he talked about play as the primer for a purposeful of pro

86
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432
Approach to space

87
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,576
Trying to teach people to be more mindful of space and how we occupy it and how it works

88
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
This giant ziggurat wouldn't come with any Specific Instructions would have no rules no single

89
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:20,607
Obvious way to play with it she wanted play Mountain to be a strange new landscape

90
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,935
It would dare children to imagine other realities

91
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,543
So that perhaps they could grow up into creative open-minded adults

92
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
I think you do cheat hope that by making playgrounds he could impact people at that

93
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
Key stage in development

94
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,391
In fact the inspiration for play mountain when he was at those keys dates himself

95
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
When he was a little boy

96
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,535
Isamu noguchi was born in Los Angeles in 1904

97
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,351
His father yone was a famous Japanese poet

98
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,679
His mother was a white American writer named leonie Gilmour

99
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,287
They met when she answered an ad he placed in the paper for a translator and assistant

100
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,847
Pretty much as soon as a Simon was born

101
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
Unity abandoned

102
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
And went back to Japan

103
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,479
Noguchi and his mother eventually follow

104
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,551
But his father had already started another family by then

105
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,879
Gucci and his mother moved to a Countryside town

106
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,743
Where noguchi's bright blue eyes marked him as an outsider to the other kids at school

107
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,815
His childhood was pretty lonely

108
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
But from their little house

109
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,191
In a little town they lived in on the seaside

110
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,495
They did have a great view of Mount Fuji

111
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,847
Spec Fuji quite far away so like just a perfect little pyramid

112
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:40,479
So you can imagine that view that's a little boy has every day going down the stairs scene Mount Fuji

113
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:45,087
That idea of his own Mount Fuji stuck with noguchi

114
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,159
If I owe them money move to Indiana as a teenager

115
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,487
It followed him to Paris review Prentice with the Sculptor brancusi

116
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
I came with him to New York City

117
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
The place that he decided would become his home

118
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:08,639
The Gucci Road play Mountain was my response based on memory of my own unhappy childhood

119
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,455
The desolate playground on a cliff in Tokyo

120
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,503
Which I approached with Dread

121
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,831
It may be that this is how I tried to join the city

122
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
New York

123
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
HIPAA law

124
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,487
Knew she wanted to move the mountain from his lonely childhood

125
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767
And reincarnated

126
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
Is a place for gathering in playing

127
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:27,839
As a kind of

128
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
Gift to the children of New York

129
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,239
And after years and years of carrying that Concept in his head

130
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
He got his big break

131
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
In 1934

132
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,663
One of the fancy people noguchi had made a bust of

133
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
Help them get a meeting with Robert Moses

134
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,551
The newly-appointed commissioner of the New York City Parks Department

135
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,903
Moses had said his number one priority was to build more playgrounds in the city

136
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
Which at the time and very few

137
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,023
Taguchi decided to bring him his idea

138
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,583
Noguchi brought Moses a model of play mount

139
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,911
2 feet square in white Plaster on a wooden frame

140
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,983
Designed to take up an entire New York city block

141
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
Noguchi carries this

142
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,591
Meter Mountain to Robert Moses office

143
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,151
Then sit down on Robert Moses desk

144
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,479
And says what if we know we built this for the children of the

145
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,527
The city this is Alexandra Lange

146
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,879
Architecture critic at curves and other of the design of childhood

147
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
Moses's

148
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
No way

149
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,767
The playgrounds Moses Envision were symbol

150
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,607
Asphalt or dirt surrounded by chain-link fence

151
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,167
With the four s's of playground equipment

152
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,495
Swings slide sandbox seesaw

153
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
All made out of steel

154
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,127
Moses was planning just the four s's in vacant Lots

155
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,943
All over the city by the hundreds

156
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,343
With this massive ambiguous otherworldly Urban Mountain

157
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,159
Which would have required the movement of huge amounts of Earth

158
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
And concrete

159
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
Probably would have cost a ton of money

160
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
No way dope

161
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
Play Kyrie 4S is I'm just going to order them

162
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,983
And like we're going to be out 400 playgrounds by tomorrow

163
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:16,639
Robert Moses dead end up erecting 658 playgrounds in New York as Parks commissioner

164
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
But from this moment on

165
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
Tienda Gucci

166
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
Became the lifelong enemies

167
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:27,391
He took his model and went home fuming and he fumed about it for the rest of his life really

168
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,999
The concept of play Mountain remained very close to noguchi's hard

169
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
Is a Gucci himself wrote

170
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,655
Play Mountain was the kernel out of which have grown all my ideas relating sculpture

171
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
To the Earth

172
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,263
Play Mountain represented this idea that noguchi had

173
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
The children didn't need instructions to play

174
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
With say

175
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
Swing Zara slide

176
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,431
Is only one way to use them

177
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,015
Kids just do the same prescribed activities over and over again

178
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
But if you give children an abstract

179
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
Surreal landscape

180
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
They can interpret it however they want

181
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,279
We can make up stories and have adventures and use their intuition

182
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
To play in a thousand different ways

183
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,631
This philosophy would later be called

184
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,423
Non-directive play

185
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
Noguchi

186
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
This was the way that

187
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,031
Sculpture could be out in the world

188
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
I'm really change the way people move

189
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
And think

190
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
He wasn't going to give up on it so easily

191
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
In 1939

192
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,295
Noguchi offered to design a playground for Honolulu Ala Moana Park

193
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
But that fell through

194
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
Bill not discouraged

195
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,183
Nicotine patches his Hawaii playground ideas

196
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,719
Back to the New York parks

197
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
Again

198
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
Again he gets rejected

199
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
Noguchi is relentless

200
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
Enso noguchi

201
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,191
Still excited by the challenge

202
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,495
When Austin design Contour playground

203
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,567
Contoured playground is really gentle

204
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,711
Basically a smooth abstracted landscape of sloping Hills and Dales and riverbeds

205
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
It's still a non-directive playground

206
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
But it's very subtle

207
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
This time

208
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
New York parks department actually seems

209
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Open today

210
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,231
I even start talking about finding a spot in Central Park to build

211
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,559
But by then was 1941

212
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,631
And the Gucci's plants were about to change

213
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
Noguchi was in California

214
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
Visiting a friend

215
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,079
He was out shopping for some Onyx for a sculpture

216
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
That I was on my way to San Diego

217
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
And I can turn on the radio and that's where I heard

218
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:41,535
Am I really need a reaction was oh my God I'm a dumb in Japanese

219
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
Nisei are Americans born to Japanese parents

220
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
With the US entering World War I

221
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
Country playground was forgotten

222
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
By both the parks department and the Gucci

223
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
They were bigger Stakes now

224
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,639
I want to be able to help in some way

225
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
Noguchi started to link up with other nisei

226
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
Looking for ways to make it clear to the government

227
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,551
But they were firmly on the American side of the war

228
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,183
Intention was that we would contract the bad press

229
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,255
Stop.

230
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,071
But that hysteria was quickly coming to a head

231
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,167
Barely two months after Pearl Harbor

232
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,263
President Roosevelt signed executive order 99066

233
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,151
Executive Order 9066 gives the American Military the right to declare martial law

234
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,479
In any part of the country that it deems necessary

235
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,015
To protect the Homeland

236
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,111
And that's with the understanding that in the Western United States

237
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,183
David Roundup the Japanese American population

238
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,511
Evacuation orders with fast-approaching deadlines

239
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,791
Started landing on

240
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
People's doorsteps

241
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,543
My car in Los Angeles

242
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,967
Noguchi had always been good at finding exactly the right person for the movement

243
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
In This Moment

244
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
He needed someone to help him take action

245
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
So he found him

246
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
In Washington DC

247
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
So I went to Washington

248
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,487
You know what I can do

249
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,143
John Collier was the head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs

250
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,727
Because the government needed to build the internment camps in large

251
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,287
Open areas of federally controlled land

252
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,615
He decided to do two of them on Native American reservations

253
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,967
Which meant that the actual undertaking of building and running these camps

254
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,015
Woodfall to John Colliers Department

255
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
John Collier was relatively Progressive

256
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,695
He wanted to give tribal governments more autonomy and support Native American culture

257
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
And then

258
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Suddenly

259
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,071
Have been given the task of Designing and building prison camps

260
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
On reservation land

261
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
Noguchi reach out to him

262
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,823
Noguchi and Collier started talking about what they could do with this assignment

263
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,895
Now that there was no way to prevent internment from happening

264
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
What do they cook time

265
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:12,063
And this is going to sound so crazy but in a way they cooked up what was a utopian scheme

266
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
Because

267
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,391
From their point of view if it's going to happen

268
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
Let's make it

269
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
As good as it can possibly be

270
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,535
Noguchi Drew up a suite of plans for the largest of the

271
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Camps being built

272
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,863
The one at Poston Arizona

273
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,263
I make plans for the park

274
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,103
Noguchi Chuck the rigid grid of a military-style camp

275
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,663
With rows and rows of tarpaper barracks

276
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,223
And cutting Avenue right down the middle of

277
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
Lined with public services

278
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,599
Schools in gardens Hospital

279
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Restaurants

280
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,463
Department store in a movie theater going to church in a cemetery

281
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,095
Zoo botanical gardens Sports fields and a mini golf course and

282
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Playground

283
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
What you're looking at is what he thinks the key parts of

284
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
Civilization art

285
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
You have a huge population of people who have been removed from their lives and artificially plunked down in the

286
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
The middle of nowhere

287
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711
Where do they are expected to live

288
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,015
Quote on quote what does that mean what is the light

289
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
What does life consist of

290
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,135
How would what does it need to be real to feel real

291
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,695
The playground is critical to it

292
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,303
The plans themselves are pretty unbelievable

293
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,119
But the really wild thing is that

294
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,215
Even though Japanese internment only affected people living on the West Coast

295
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,519
And maybe she was living on the East Coast

296
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,311
Noguchi and Collier decide

297
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:41,151
Noguchi should actually go to this concentration camp in Poston Arizona

298
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
Voluntarily

299
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,735
And leave it there while he carried out his plan

300
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
And that's how I happened

301
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,623
The camp was being constructed in the middle of the desert

302
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
The southwestern part of Arizona

303
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,743
On the Colorado River Indian Reservation

304
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
Who is hardly anything

305
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
For miles around

306
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,119
Scrubby brush and dust

307
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
Mountains in the far distance

308
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,495
Sanducci got to post in like a week before it opened

309
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
And I was hungry

310
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:22,367
Noguchi was giving his own room and thought he'd soon be getting to work on realizing his vision for utopian

311
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
This was a guy who plunged

312
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
Play Mountain down in front of Robert Moses

313
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
And said

314
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
Let's build this for kids

315
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
Estranged hopefulness knew no limits

316
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
Resume is the camp opened

317
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,447
It became painfully clear taniguchi

318
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,775
But the people weren't coming there for an idyllic new lifestyle

319
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
They were prisoners

320
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,687
Do the camp administrators from the war relocation Authority

321
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
Noguchi looked

322
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
Just like another one of the prisoners

323
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,807
I wouldn't give him the time of day

324
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,111
Because he had some special privileges

325
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,671
The other internees assumed he was the traitor

326
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
In Cahoots with the camp administrators

327
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
He immediately realized he was

328
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:06,655
He was sort of the worst of Both Worlds because he was just in an attorney from the administration's point of view

329
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,495
And he was a turncoat like a spy

330
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
From the other entries point of view

331
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,615
After about two months at Poston

332
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:20,991
Noguchi realize that the war relocation Authority had no interest in making it a nice place to live

333
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
They ran it like a prison

334
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
Because it was a prison camp

335
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,719
All of John Colliers and micucci's idealistic plans were ignored

336
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559
See if there was no chance of doing what he'd come to do

337
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,607
Noguchi decided to move on

338
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
He figured he'd just

339
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
Go back to normal life

340
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,751
Mina famous artist in hanging out with his famous artist friend

341
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
And they wouldn't let him

342
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Which was definitely

343
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
Not a part of the plan

344
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,687
You no idea that he wouldn't be able to leave

345
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
Noguchi with suddenly

346
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
Prisoner

347
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,207
Have you made enemies of attorneys and administrators alike

348
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,255
He spent most of his time alone

349
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
With nothing to do

350
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
Person with a bleak

351
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
Aaron place

352
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
Almost every day there was

353
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
Triple-digit Heat

354
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,007
Huge dust storms tearing through

355
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,055
Coming in through the thin walls of the barracks

356
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
Getting stuck in your bed and your mouth

357
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
In your eyes

358
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,199
Noguchi wrote to one of his famous friends

359
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
The artist Man Ray

360
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,831
Quote here time has stopped and nothing is of any

361
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,879
Nothing of any value

362
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
Neither our time

363
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
Or our skill

364
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
The world

365
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
Is nuts

366
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
After 7 months

367
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,119
And many many letters and phone calls

368
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,935
John Collier was able to get noguchi out

369
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
And he never

370
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
Went back

371
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:57,759
It's hard to know what to make of noguchi's failed mission to post in

372
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,575
And it kind of leads to this deeper question

373
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
Does it even make sense

374
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
To try to find Joy or beauty

375
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Playfulness

376
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
In a system that's

377
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,791
Just fundamentally

378
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
Awful

379
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
You know

380
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,167
Trying to make a prison better when the prison shouldn't exist

381
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
Critic Alexander Lane

382
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
Like he thought he could

383
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,055
Make this internment camp more Humane but it's

384
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
Is it inhumane endeavour

385
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,175
The whole experience was painful for noguchi

386
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,735
His goals have been so compassionate going in

387
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,295
Racism in fear and bureaucracy

388
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
Kill those dreams

389
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
And then imprison him

390
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
When he tried to help

391
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:40,255
New York 1940

392
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
I've had about enough

393
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
After posting

394
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247
The idea of Designing Public Works

395
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
And playgrounds

396
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295
Must have seemed

397
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
Wrong somehow

398
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,159
How could you think about play

399
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
When there's so much

400
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
Cruelty in the world

401
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,023
In fact in 1943

402
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,327
The year after noguchi gets out of post in

403
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
It makes this sculpture called

404
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
This tortured Earth

405
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,471
Which is like the nightmare version of his model for

406
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
Contoured playground

407
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,287
Twisted landscape

408
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,103
It looks like it's been stabbed and torn with a knife

409
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,711
But once he was back in New York noguchi put Post in behind him

410
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,759
He threw himself into the art scene

411
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:39,135
He's designing Furniture he's making sculpture he's building a career New York City

412
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:43,487
Play Gucci steps back from his utopian ideas about art and sculpture

413
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,839
And this is the. When you design some of the things he's most famous for today

414
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
Including the iconic coffee table

415
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,215
The Gucci's career in sculpture really took off

416
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:58,591
And you also got to design other kinds of environments he designed and sets for Martha Graham

417
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,431
And sculpture Gardens for corporations like IBM Chase Bank

418
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:08,831
He was smoothing up a storm becoming a household name and a real star of mid-century Art and Design

419
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,903
Maybe she has that hunger in my soul

420
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,719
Something more meaningful than the New York art scene

421
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,559
He still wants to make something that can transcend a gallery space

422
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,887
And that is because again I have this feeling that

423
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,983
Culture was an important part of the living experience

424
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,567
Something for electives

425
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:37,759
After a decade of looking inward indulging in the Adoration of the art world and recovering from posting

426
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
Noguchi turns his sights back

427
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
The playground

428
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,415
Shake that realization that he had

429
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
The playgrounds were actually

430
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
The perfect way

431
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
Sculptor to make real change in the world

432
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,631
3 tried two more times to build playgrounds for New York

433
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,167
Once in 1950

434
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
At the new UN building

435
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
And another in the early sixties

436
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
Riverside Park

437
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,127
And again noguchi's playground plans were shot down by the city

438
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,175
But something was different

439
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
And those round 2 projections

440
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,503
Because noguchi was now

441
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,783
Mega famous

442
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
Everyone in the art world had heard

443
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,135
All about his rejected playground design

444
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
They've been written up and newspapers

445
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
And the model is worth

446
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
Displayed in museums

447
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,816
So other Architects artists and designers

448
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Started copying

449
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:31,008
So there are fair number of people in the fifties and sixties making abstract concrete forms and saying that they

450
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Care for children

451
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
It becomes

452
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
A movement

453
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
Whole strand of playground is

454
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
Taniguchi kind of founded

455
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
Alexander Wang calls this

456
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
The abstractionist

457
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,320
You can play with an abstract form

458
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,600
Anyway you want

459
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
Imagine it is anything you like

460
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
Face shapes

461
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,232
Can become anything in your mind

462
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,048
In the 60s and 70s

463
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,352
Designers artists and architects

464
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,680
Build abstract playgrounds all over the world

465
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,496
Climbing arches and stepping stones in Amsterdam

466
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,800
Blobby triple slides in Austria

467
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Webs

468
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,616
Steel & Rope in Japan

469
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
And in the US

470
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,736
Modular octahedrons and pixelated wooden landscapes

471
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296
All made by famous architects

472
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,856
Designing and building abstract

473
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
Non-directive playground

474
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,720
Even noguchi himself was able to build some

475
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Abstract

476
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Dish

477
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,584
Sculptural playground equipment in the 60s and 70s

478
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:34,496
She was one of the first to say that and make those things and kind of taking children seriously

479
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,776
Connoisseurs of 4

480
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
No one

481
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,616
It would seem like the perfect time for noguchi

482
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,920
To build the thing he wanted his whole life

483
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,968
True play Mountain vision

484
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,576
What's something that could turn Landscapes into massive abstract forms

485
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:53,184
But just as it seems to Gucci's ideas are gaining traction

486
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
It's cut short

487
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,816
Is the 60s turn to the 70s in the 70s draw to a close

488
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376
The abstract playground movement goes Underground

489
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,936
Because in the 1980s

490
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,496
The entire world a playground design in the US

491
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
Change dramatically

492
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
After the break

493
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,944
What the obstructionist movement went underground

494
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:21,088
And why your neighborhood playground probably looks very similar to every other neighborhood playground

495
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
Atlas

496
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Between the beats

497
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,744
Bongs and Charter of our devices

498
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,328
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

499
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:36,960
If I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

500
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:42,848
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room

501
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,640
Technology talk to us

502
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,688
It is a creation of Sonic trap

503
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,760
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

504
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,344
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

505
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,392
To make them more human

506
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
Turn the living room lights on

507
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Okay

508
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
Dim the living room lights to 50

509
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
80%

510
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
Okay

511
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,032
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taken away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

512
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,848
Makes for a much more natural experience

513
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
Turn the living room lights on

514
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
Dim the living room lights to 50

515
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
2%

516
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,416
Representing two special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

517
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
About how are sounds gay

518
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
Is impacting our health

519
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,792
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

520
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,864
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

521
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,912
Right here on the 99.

522
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,616
2 year old boy named Frank Nelson was climbing a 12 ft tall slide in the Chicago Park

523
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,920
Because that's just how tall slides used to be

524
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,016
He spoke to the railing off the steps and hit his head on hard ass

525
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
And

526
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,344
Has permanent brain damage

527
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,672
Frank became paralyzed on his left side

528
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,256
Ear problems with vision and speech and had to wear a helmet

529
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,304
Protect his fractured skull

530
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,608
So there's this big lawsuit where the

531
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,680
Park system of Chicago has to pay out millions of dollars

532
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,728
9.5 million dollars

533
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Be exact

534
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,056
The accident was in 1978

535
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
And it changed ever

536
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
The time

537
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
There were no laws

538
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:26,016
Or real industry standards even when it came to the safety of playground equipment

539
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:30,112
But Frank Nelson's fall was one of a number of lawsuits

540
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,184
Led the consumer product safety commission to publish

541
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
Handbook

542
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,000
For public playground safety

543
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
In 1981

544
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
Then another standards organization

545
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,400
The ASTM published its own guide

546
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
Pretty soon these Robux

547
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,520
We're in the hands of insurance companies and Parks Department

548
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
School boards

549
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
Across the United States

550
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,664
And now to this day almost all playground have to be approved

551
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,224
Buy certified playground safety inspector

552
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,040
ICraig Fatale with

553
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
Safe to play

554
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,696
With you just a few of the things that I used to make sure that your playground is safe

555
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,584
When I do a search YouTube video that a certified playground safety inspector uses to advertise his services

556
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:16,704
Is standing on your typical modern playground and he has a bunch of these weirdly shaped in the metal objects

557
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
Sun sticks

558
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:21,312
They're all different sizes each approximating different child size body

559
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
The handbook

560
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,176
Procure wish I could

561
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,504
Imitate head at 9 in so

562
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,856
Defeat would go in and then they had we get stuck so obviously we don't want that to happen

563
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:40,000
And safety inspectors basically tried jamming these probes into every space or gap on a playground

564
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
Looking for places where

565
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
Kids could fall or get

566
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
Pinch poke.

567
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Trapped

568
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,192
Obviously no one wants kids getting hurt on playground

569
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
But as you might imagine

570
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:54,848
All these rules and regulations make the job of a playground designer

571
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
A lot harder

572
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,408
Don't get me wrong the job is

573
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
Fine as hell

574
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,224
Tom Keller designs playground

575
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,272
That look forward to coming in here every day

576
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
Because what a blast

577
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,600
But the more

578
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,648
Rules we have to wait here too

579
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
It just becomes

580
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,744
Noir Disco

581
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
Impossible

582
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,608
Definitely more difficult to think

583
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Outside the box

584
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680
Tom works at landscape structures

585
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,496
Playground Manufacturing Company in Minnesota

586
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,080
Annie's playground standards are so detailed

587
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,152
But they end up ruling out almost all variation

588
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,456
10 cases of common playground equipment

589
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
Swings

590
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
Slides

591
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
Spraying equipment and stuff like that

592
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
Truly

593
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
Create

594
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,184
Their own being because the rules

595
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
It's going to look like that

596
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,024
A slide is a slide

597
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
Your ability

598
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
Almost

599
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:54,496
Theoretically we've loved the idea of a special or unusual playground

600
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
Like even within Tom's company

601
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,384
They want to manufacture beautiful new forms for kids to play on

602
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
Are executives

603
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,200
You know they're like

604
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,248
We want to slide that nobody's ever thought

605
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,064
You got to be more creative than that and I'm like ice

606
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,136
You know what I hear you don't want to read the rule book

607
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
Cuz that's going to bore you

608
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
Baidu

609
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,256
Trust me it is what it is

610
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,096
So the playgrounds that you see everywhere

611
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
Neighborhood parks

612
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
School yards

613
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,448
They still all look

614
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
More or less the same

615
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
The majority of players

616
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,544
On the market today

617
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,104
Are what we refer to as post index system

618
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,408
Post index systems are also called

619
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,200
Post and platform playground

620
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
And with those you have Dax

621
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,528
And you have stairs

622
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,320
Bears and uibe pathways

623
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
The post and platform equipment

624
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,160
Essentially combines

625
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440
Swing slide

626
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:51,840
And monkey bars into one piece of equipment is made of plastic parts in bright

627
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
Primary colors

628
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,680
Sometimes the parts are connected with Pathways cover

629
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Grooves

630
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,728
Sometimes with Bridges

631
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
But there are steps

632
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,336
Find letters coming off the platforms at every turn

633
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,616
Blocking kids

634
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,640
It's from being able to just

635
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
Step off

636
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
The platform into space

637
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,504
That agglomeration is kind of in

638
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
Responsible safety standards

639
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,088
Post and platform playground

640
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,160
Definitely have more variety than the 4S is that

641
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,696
Robert Moses was into

642
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
On the music style playgrounds

643
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,328
Kids were just moving from one repetitive activity to the next

644
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,400
At least with posting platform structures

645
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,984
Kids can make some decisions about how to get onto the platform

646
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,032
And then how to get down from it again

647
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,152
But still posting platform playgrounds are all remixes of the same basic

648
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,968
Cat it's time for a change a little bit

649
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
This is Scott Roshe

650
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,552
Creative director at landscape structure

651
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,624
In addition to the standard playground kits

652
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,440
Landscape structures also designs custom playground

653
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,488
The clients that can afford them

654
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,816
Actually one of Scott's big inspiration

655
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,120
Is the work of isamu noguchi

656
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:02,496
Designs of today hours are echoing a lot of what what noguchi's concepts were

657
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,568
The kind of abstract playgrounds that new Gucci inspired

658
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,104
Are starting to re-emerge

659
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,896
We're starting to bring them back

660
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,944
In a lot of custom playground design

661
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,272
Pretty special projects Scott works with a lot of landscape

662
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,600
Moving Earth around and experimenting with new form

663
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,696
We've been to playgrounds that we've designed that are very abstract

664
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,280
And where parents literally say I don't know

665
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
How

666
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
This is supposed to work

667
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,120
That's the best

668
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,728
And this goes back to noguchi's concept of non-directive play

669
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,800
If adults are confused by a piece of play equipment

670
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,592
It often means that kids

671
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,872
Will be all over it

672
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,920
The kids are going to figure it out there

673
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,224
They're going to attack it they're going to

674
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,296
Go and have fun they're going to make it

675
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Play

676
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,624
We don't have to tell them how to do that

677
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,672
We can make it safe and

678
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,488
Last a long time and look beautiful but man

679
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
Let them play

680
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,888
This Resurgence of abstract playgrounds is still developing

681
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
But special destination playground

682
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,264
I'm sorry experimenting with new materials and processes

683
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,640
They're able to make forms that would have been astronomically expensive to produce and noguchi's time

684
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
Contemporary designers

685
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:19,040
Are now starting to push back against convention and play with more abstract shapes

686
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,112
4 communities that can afford custom playground

687
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,952
So I feel like there are people that are pushing the envelope

688
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,560
And you know it's expensive to start out with but if more people adopt this

689
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
Equipment

690
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
The price group

691
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Come down

692
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:36,704
Although there are no playgrounds in New York City with Nucci's name on them

693
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
Is ideas

694
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,800
About imagination in Freedom to play

695
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
I've left a deep mark

696
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
On playground designers

697
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,944
And are affecting the emerging playgrounds all around us

698
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:51,552
Noguchi could have never imagined the long shadow of his ideas

699
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,112
Is greatest Concepts

700
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,392
Had never been made

701
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,048
That's a recording from 1973

702
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
At that point

703
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,888
Noguchi had only ever seen one of his playground

704
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
Kind of built in Japan

705
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,264
A few years later he designed another one in Atlanta

706
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,848
But both of these were nothing close to his true

707
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Play Mountain vision

708
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
His own City

709
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
New York

710
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,480
Have rejected him five times

711
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,576
Never found a way to break through a New York even after Moses was gone

712
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,624
For various reasons there's always a reason

713
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,928
But I am usually frustrating

714
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,208
This was his home

715
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:36,608
Noguchi's model for play Mountain remain on display in his studio in Long Island City

716
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
Unrealised dream

717
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
In miniature

718
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,752
That is until January of 1988

719
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:48,128
A man from Sapporo Japan comes and visits noguchi and is going around his Studio

720
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
In Long Island

721
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
City

722
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,272
And he says you know what like I I can get one of your playgrounds built in

723
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,040
In Sapporo

724
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Japan

725
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,112
At this point in 1988

726
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,416
Noguchi is 84 years old

727
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:05,280
He goes out to visit this marshy site in Sapporo called moerenuma Park

728
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:06,816
It's just

729
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
Perfect

730
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,144
This is the spot

731
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,704
Foreplay Mountain would finally live

732
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,312
Noguchi started designing play structures and Earthworks for the park

733
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,896
With his longtime collaborator the architect shouji sit down

734
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
But in the winter of that year

735
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,736
I came down with a cold

736
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
How many came back to New York

737
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,576

00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,808
It's like I could be on the moon.

775
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,904
And I get to the top of the mountain and there's a memorial to noguchi

776
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,208
Says you know he made the

777
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:15,840
Isamu noguchi was never able to take in the view from the peak

778
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,120
What is creation

779
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
The sculpture he spent his

780
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,960
Whole life dreaming about

781
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,496

00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,080
Teleported from the wild alien planet is mine

The one place

784
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,408
Noguchi ever felt

785
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
He really belongs

786
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:35,808

How we function in this

788
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,768
I think I have that kind of feeling about sculpture like wanting to be inside the sculpture

789
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,048
Not just looking at

790
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,448

791
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,776

To move our bodies through space

795
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,224

Or brand new Delights

797
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,576
