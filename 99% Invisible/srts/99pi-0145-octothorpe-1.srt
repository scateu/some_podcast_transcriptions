In check Twitter

Not proud of this

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,584
Just the way it is

44
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:44,704
Twitter always struck me as the social media platform that was the most like Broadcasting

45
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:50,336
It's an ongoing conversation

46
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,360
Angela power

47
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:56,992
It's a lot like scanning to a radio dial

48
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
Telling you about their day

49
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,088
Reacting to shocking news making jokes

50
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
Quinceanera round legs

51
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,464
I tweeted Roman Mars by the way if you haven't heard me say that before

52
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,840
And sometimes I tweet at truffleman

53
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,400
But if you want to find out about the show in general

54
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
Does a hashtag for it

55
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
It's

56
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
#9 9 p.m.

57
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:25,152
The hashtag of course is comprised of two vertical lines intersecting two horizontal lines that looks like a

58
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
Play tic tac toe board

59
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,528
In the current Digital World the hashtag identifies movements events

60
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Happening

61
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
Brands topics of all time

62
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
Hashtags help people gather

63
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
That's incredible power to give to like individual

64
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
As a character

65
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
I mean awesome

66
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,280
It's got like this little

67
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,816
Typographic superhero story now

68
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,632
And this superhero story Stars Chris Messina

69
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,936
I'm Chris Messina the inventor of the hashtag

70
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
Designer

71
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
And translator

72
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Human culture

73
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
That's probably a little bit bloated

74
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,688
Chris was the first one to use a hashtag on Twitter

75
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
Before it was even called a hashtag

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,064
Tag back in August of 2007 when he was going to an event called barkcamp

77
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,648
It's a nerdy thing it's everything it's it's an event that you go to

78
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,720
That's completely unstructured in unplanned and the participants.

79
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,280
So the participants needed a way of organizing

80
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
Which led Chris to tweet the

81
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
The very first

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
Hashtag

83
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,912
Even though at that point it was just a pound sign

84
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
How do you guys feel about using

85
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
Pound

86
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
Barkcamp

87
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
Four groups

88
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
Putting a pound sign in front of the word barkcamp helps the other people at barkcamp take out the

89
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,088
The word bar camp in their Twitter stream and encourages all the other bar Camp distance to use

90
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:43,488
Conversation

91
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
Some people got on board and agreed to use the pound sign

92
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,192
Most were like okay you go do that

93
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,776
The pound symbol had already provided other corners of the web

94
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,592
Internet relay chat AKA IRC

95
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,432
Use the pound sign to represent chat rooms or conversation Channel

96
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
There's another social network to the time called Raikou

97
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
That also have these Channel

98
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,320
So there was other stuff that came before me

99
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,648
But Chris was using bunch of pound signs throughout his tweets

100
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
I was putting

101
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
Pound symbol

102
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
In front of my word

103
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
Bieber like I don't understand what you're doing

104
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
You're putting all this strange punctuation info

105
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
Your stuff end

106
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
It looks dumb

107
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,167
But the True Believers did by the sign

108
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
One Twitter user called it a

109
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
A hash

110
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Tag

111
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
Because hash

112
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Is the British name for the

113
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
Sign and these are being used

114
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
Is a category

115
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,687
Tags and then the hash and the tag. Conjoined into one word

116
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,015
Chris actually brought the hashtag idea to Twitter headquarters directly

117
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
But they thought it would never catch on

118
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Monkey

119
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,903
Then a few months later in October of 2007

120
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,975
The purpose of the hashtag was fully realized

121
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
A friend of mine was down in

122
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55,167
San Diego his name is Nate Ritter and he was using Twitter basically pulling all the stuff together around these fires at work

123
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
Are going on in San Diego

124
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,591
Wildfire in San Diego

125
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
He was

126
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,943
Prefixing all of his tweets with sand space Diego space fire

127
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,343
So Chris told Nate but he should switch to hashtag San Diego fire all one word and then other users would imitate

128
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
It worked

129
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,975
People trying to find out about the fire knew exactly where to look on Twitter

130
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,583
And this was a moment where everyone went that's what friends are for

131
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Clarify

132
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,423
Hashtags were nothing that Twitter planned on

133
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,983
And they kind of drag their feet on incorporating it

134
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,311
There must be a better way to organize all this in

135
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
That's fine

136
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
I'm weak I'm looking for

137
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
The hashtag and

138
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
Andy lorek

139
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,551
Letting employee at Twitter officially brought in the hashtag

140
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
The users brought in the hashtag

141
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Like what all I did was

142
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
#Detroit

143
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
One line of code

144
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Give me about fifteen

145
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,095
That one line of code meant that when you click on a word with a hashtag in front of it

146
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,703
You'd see a page with all the other tweets that also contained that hashtag word

147
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,799
And basically this help you round up everyone was talking about a specific

148
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:11,711
And now the hashtag is a tool used in advertisements social movement music videos memes TV shows

149
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,503
And in conversation

150
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
#sometimes

151
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
Hey Justin what's up

The busy working has that Rising even Chris acknowledges how irritating this

154
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,983
Mostly when I'm being annoying or ironic but I'm I'm coming to sort of except that that's the phrase

155
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:40,383
It's getting to the point where the hashtag is erasing the symbols other uses friend of mine actually saying

156
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:47,039
He is delivery guy showed up and was looking for a hashtag to a though I'd hope that most people who made deliveries for a live

157
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
#SMH

158
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111

In the states it's usually called the number sign

161
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
The pound sign

162
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,535
In the UK is often called a hash mark

163
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
Because of the way it looks and everything else

164
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
This is Keith Houston

In proofreading

177
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,623
If you see a hash symbol this means space

178
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
Should be in Sac

179
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951

00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
The word Libra

188
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
I like the constellation mean scale

189
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Bounce

190
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
Libra Pondo

191
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:54,879
And these two names were interchangeable so Romans referred to this weight measurement as a Libra or a Pondo

192
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
So the word Libra was often Abreva

193
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,743
Lowercase L lowercase b

194
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Which of course

195
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
We still use

196
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
ABC V

197
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
Mien Phi bibra R5

198
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
Time is it

199
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
This is also why British currency the pound

200
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:16,127
Is represented by a stylized L4 Libre the abbreviation lb becomes a thing

201
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,735
And often times it was drawn with a little bar across the tops of both letters

202
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,295
Just to show that the L and the b word connect

203
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
Scribes

204
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,855
Our writers

205
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,415
Ascorbic careless so they write faster and faster

206
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Fosters

207
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
B&M

208
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Dependent

209
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
The paper before it

210
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
Barcroft

211
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
The Talk

212
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
I'm so this seems to have given

213
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
Rise to

214
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
Symbol for hash mark

215
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
Or lumber yard

216
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
Overtime the symbols meaning started 2 by 4

217
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,615
It was used like lb for the unit pound and also started to be used

218
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
Just as a number sign

219
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,687
It had a lot of various uses

220
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
What is important enough to wind up

221
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Typewriter keyboard

222
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Which is

223
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Kind of

224
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
The keys thing

225
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
Is the thing that symbol had to do in order to

226
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,487
Survive because symbols that didn't make it onto the typewriter keyboard got pretty unpopular

227
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
Like the interrobang

228
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
The pilcrow

229
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
For the manicure

230
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Poor thanks

231
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,167
Fast forward to 1963

232
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,983
The invention of the touch-tone telephone

233
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,543
Hi this is a bell systems new

234
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
Hyundai

235
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,151
The touch tone phone used buttons instead of a rotary wheel

236
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,271
So unlike previous phones the numbers didn't have to be arranged in a circle on the dial anymore

237
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,647
Bell Laboratories a research subsidiary of AT&T

238
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,231
Experimented with a few different designs for the telephone keypad

239
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,791
They try to arranging the numbers into rows of 5

240
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
A circle across

241
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
The step pattern

242
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:45,471
But they ended up using the numbers 1 through 9 in a three-by-three grid

243
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,287
Can you put zero alone in the bottom center

244
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,847
Years later in 1968

245
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:57,247
Why not add keys to either side of the zero this would make the keypad into a rectangle

246
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
View more options on the phone menu

247
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
To repeat these options

248
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
Press the star key

249
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
Because unlike rotary phones

250
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,047
Touch-tone phones allow you to continue to dial after the connection has been made

251
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,191
So you can punch in extensions and navigate automated menus

252
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Press 2

253
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
Originally Bell Labs wanted

254
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,591
Pretty shapes on the 2X

255
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Star buttons

256
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,199
That made prototype phone that had a five pointed star and a diamond

257
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,479
On either side of the zero

258
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,271
But an engineer named Doug Kerr

259
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,343
Would have none of this diamond and five point star business

260
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,671
That's because by that time a new thing of coming to the picture

261
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:43,583
The possibility of customers dialing directly from their phones into a computer for such things as checking bank balances

262
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
Is there validating their credit cards or what have you

263
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,727
Doug Kerr wanted to make sure that the two new symbols will be one second

264
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Computer could recognize

265
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,847
Ones that appear on a keyboard and were part of the computers vocabulary

266
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
So there would be no uncertainty

267
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
About how a certain button

268
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Would be recorded

269
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
And the data that went into the computer

270
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,831
Bell Labs was pretty set on their star and Diamond idea

271
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:09,183
To the compromise was an ass trick for the star in a pound for the diamond

272
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Because

273
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
You know the

274
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Center

275
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
How to look Diamond like I guess

276
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,423
For a second AT&T was like can we at least call it a diamond there's no reasonable reason

277
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,775
It's not a diamond that all AT&T didn't know what to call this button in their manuals

278
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:29,407
And this led to the creation of what some people including Keith Houston consider the symbols official name

279
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
The octothorpe

280
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
The octothorpe

281
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
One day I was out with my

282
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
Engineering partner

283
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:41,951
And we got to talking about it and thought maybe we should come up with a new name in marketing for AT&T

284
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,023
During the time being is engineering partner look at the symbol

285
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,327
And saw that I had eight line sticking out of it

286
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
So we'll put the word cocktail in there

287
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:54,751
Tendentious audited are we just a wealth phe RP

288
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
In there too

289
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,591
Because it sounds kind of Greek ashamed

290
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
Davidson stature

291
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,919
They called it an octothorpe

292
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:08,319
But that morphed into octothorpe which rumor has it came about because someone at Bell Labs change the name to turn it into a trip

293
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
Olympic Athlete Jim Thorpe

294
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
But no one really knows

295
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,951
G is it proper to spell It Off.

296
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
For president

297
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
There is no proper

298
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,375
Doug called it an octothorpe Lauren called it an octothorpe

299
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Buttock

300
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Joe Thorpe

301
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
Seems to have the most widespread use

302
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,263
That with you is not widely

303
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,919
Originally the only reason octothorpe ever caught on with him Bell Labs was because Engineers thought it was funny joke

304
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
The manufacturer

305
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
Totally hated that

306
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
And pretty much killed in the 70

307
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
But today for a lot of typos

308
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Octothorpe

309
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Is the sign

310
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
Real name

311
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
In typographic

312
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
You might think

313
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:53,375
Topographic nerd like Heath love it because it feels the most neutral and official

314
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
Print using this symbol

315
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Whatever it's

316
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,495
Doug Kerr and the other Bell Labs engineers

317
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,591
Really understood that we would be using telephones to communicate with computer

318
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,199
This is exactly the same reason why Chris Messina chose to use this symbol

319
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,735
Back in that tweet in mm

320
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
7 of the time we had

321
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Blackberry Smirnoff

322
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
Hardware-based

323
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
Keyboards

324
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,975
SMS because that's the way the

325
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Republic

326
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
Which left Chris only two choices

327
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
A star with a pal

328
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
Lockport whatever

329
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
It's

330
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
Probably one of the most dense symbols

331
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
And so

332
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,615
When you're reading a sentence or you're reading a tweet it stands out

333
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:42,015
On promotional materials on other social media platforms on protest signs in your annoying friends conversations

334
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,575
Just saw my dentist hashtag hashtag Dental Care

335
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
#have any free hashtag

336
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,439
That's how we do and this is all probably going to sound so dated in like

337
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
5 years

338
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
For two years

339
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
Or maybe a few months

340
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,607
Getting hashtag out loud I'm going to sound like someone reading a telegram

341
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,167
Mr. Gower cable do you need cash stop

342
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,823
My office instructed to advance you up to $25,000.

343
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
Sam Wainwright

344
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
In a telegram has on Twitter

345
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
Are speech changed to accommodate the machine

346
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
The hashtag is a way of

347
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,551
Changing our language to be more computer friend

348
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,159
And what we're needing to do is actually invert the Paradigm where the computers become more friendly to you

349
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,743
So we're probably not going to be using hashtags

350
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
The way Twitter uses

351
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Hashtags

352
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
Forever

353
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,863
But this won't mean the end of the symbol itself

354
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:35,519
It started out on paper but then it leaped to typewriters computers and phones and it seems like it's probably going to stick around

355
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,311
Whatever we decide to call it

356
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
#hashtag

357
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,175
#pound hashtag number sign

358
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
#lumberyard

359
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
#tic tac toe

360
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
#musical sharp if you really lazy

361
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Stop

362
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,631
99% invisible was produced this week by Avery trufelman the same Greenspan Katie mingle and me Roman Mars

363
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:08,287
We are project to 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco and produced of the offices of our

364
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:13,151
And architecture and Interiors firm in beautiful Downtown Oakland California

365
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
I also invented the caps lock key

366
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
People curse me everyday when they

367
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
David engaged and wish it was disengaged

368
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
Between the beats

369
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,951
