1990

28
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
We have ignition and Orbiter as we continue to explore the mysteries of the

29
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,760
It's the late 20th century

30
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:31,136
And as a threat of Y2K and rap metal crossover Loom large in people's minds

Inessa satellite blasts off towards Mars

20 seconds after liftoff

35
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
Everything continues to go well

36
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:46,496
So this satellite weighing 338 kg

37
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
At 745 lb

38
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
Yeah yeah we'll get to that

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,896
338 kilograms

40
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
Hurdle through space

41
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
What's the distance

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
Planet

43
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,272
It takes nearly a year to get there

44
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
And when it gets close

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
The satellite fires its main engine

46
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,416
To go into orbit around Mars

47
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,816
Up until that point all data from the spacecraft appeared normal everything was running smoothly

48
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,424
The engine burn begin status of spacecraft disappears behind Ma

49
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,496
Mission Control weight Sports Therapy

50
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
And they wait

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
And white

52
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
And wait

53
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
The spacecraft

54
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
Never imagined

55
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
The Mars climate Orbiter

56
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
Is lost

57
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:36,416
I'm sorry to report that we have a serious problem with the Mars climate Orbiter we may in fact be fake

58
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,816
Chasing a lots of mission we believe the spacecraft came in at a lower altitude than than we had

59
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,632
And that depending on on

60
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
On a low that was into something weird

61
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
Confirm it

62
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,264
Italy resulted in

63
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,152
Scientist at Nasa began to pour over the data

64
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,712
Looking for Clues as to what might have gone wrong

65
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
And before long they figure it out

66
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
The spacecraft was supposed to approach the planet at an altitude of 150 km

67
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
3 miles

68
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
When in fact

69
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
Its approach should be lower

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
Much lower

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,656
The post-mortem at NASA found that a pretty simple arrow was to blame

72
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
A conversion error

73
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,264
Vanessa investigator board confirm the cause of the

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,080
The failure of the 125 million dollar spacecraft

75
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:31,456
The NASA team at jet propulsion laboratory assumed they were using the metric system to measure rocket

76
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
NASA was using the Matrix

77
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
The international standard

78
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
Word calculations

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,184
But one of their contractors was using us customary units

80
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,256
The proper term the American system of inches

81
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Pounds in gallon

82
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
Years of planning

83
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,680
Hundreds of millions of dollars literally Up In Smoke

84
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,728
Burned up in the Martian atmosphere

85
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,568
An oldie called someone give the right calculation

86
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,592
In the wrong unit

87
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,736
This wasn't the only time a conversion error resulted in disaster

88
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
Old me disaster

89
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,368
In the early eighties and airliner run out of fuel mid

90
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,928
Fly after metric conversion errors

91
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,720
How to make an emergency landing

92
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
Ending 2001

93
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:23,167
The LA Zoo learned a seventy-five-year-old Galapagos tortoise to an animal Management program at a local

94
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
College

95
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,007
Is it one that Clarence the tortoise was

96
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:31,871
Big and needed an enclosure for an animal weighing 250 kg

97
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
200

98
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
Pounds which is only a hundred

99
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
13 kilogram

100
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,295
About Hafiz actual weight

101
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
But not in his new home

102
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
Clarence destroyed it

103
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,719
But these kinds of failures haven't been enough to get the US

104
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,303
The switch over to the measurement system used by the vast majority of the world

105
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,607
We Americans measure things our own way

106
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,935
Units that are basically inscrutable to non-americans

107
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,263
Maybe all of whom have been brought up in an all metric environment

108
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
They use meters

109
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
Liters in kilograms

110
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
Knot yarn

111
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
Gallons in pounds

112
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,479
You might have noticed that I'm a non-american myself

113
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:14,367
And while I've never left the spacecraft to a distant planet run into other problems

114
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,439
Like ordering way too much deli meat

115
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
Too much is never a problem Joel

116
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,839
I live in the US for a couple years in Wild

117
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,887
Culturally elect amiezii

118
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,447
I never really adjusted to your measurements

119
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
Australia where I'm from

120
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,567
Is being a metric country for over 40 years

121
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
Optometric

122
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
I don't really have a sense of how much

123
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,967
Half a pound ways of how warm

124
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
60 degrees Fahrenheit

125
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,807
When to use wasn't enough

126
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Change that

127
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,927
So when I looked in the Stateside routinely head out in cold weather without a jacket

128
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
Oh Come Home With

129
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Too much bacon

130
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:57,375
So why with so many Industries and people like Joel Crossing Borders with so much fluidity

131
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,727
Has the US not fully committed to the system the rest of the world uses

132
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
As you might guess

133
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
It's complicated

134
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,615
The metric system has a kind of complicated history in United

135
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:14,015
It states this is Stephen meme a history professor at the University of Georgia and the author of a forthcoming book

136
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,831
On the history of standardization in the United

137
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:22,463
States that's in the 1790s when the United States was first fumbling around

138
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,279
Toward fulfilling the Constitutional mandate

139
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:31,935
To create a uniform system of weights and measures the metric system was at that point just a glimmer in the eye of a

140
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
French revolutionaries

141
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:40,383
And there was some discussion at the time led by Thomas Jefferson that the u.s. adopt a decimal base system kind of like the oven

142
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Metric

143
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,711
The idea didn't gain much traction

144
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
So when it came time

145
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
2

146
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,879
Systematized American weights and measures we ultimately through a lot with what we were working with

147
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
What time which was

148
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
The bushels in pounds

149
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
America had inherited this old

150
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
System of measurement from the British

151
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,399
It had its roots in Roman and Anglo-Saxon units

152
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,239
And then evolved over thousands of years before American independence

153
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
Around the same time

154
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,847
French revolutionaries were heading in a New Direction

155
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,919
Tempted to throw out their old system

156
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
Which I found this

157
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
Pleasingly irrational

158
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
And switch it for new system

159
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
The Matrix

160
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,111
The metric system is a decimal

161
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
What is the meaning relies on Multi

162
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Perfect 10

163
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,743
10 millimeters to come one centimeter

164
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,559
100cm become one meter

165
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
And so on

166
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,399
The French begin promoting the system internationally

167
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,727
Arguing that it would encourage trade and bring the world together

168
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
And it took off

169
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,103
By the mid-nineteenth century there was a growing adoption

170
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
Existen worldwide

171
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,759
And As the metric system spread some people in the US started to feel left out

172
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Educator

173
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
They wanted the US to get with the program and officially

174
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Go metric

175
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,951
The Glens of really well to scientific

176
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Research and inquiry

177
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
And for educators

178
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,095
It's really easy to teach turn it and send it makes a lot of sense

179
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:09,215
But abandoning the US customary system did not sit well with a lot of paper

180
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,263
It was tremendous resist

181
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,847
The resistance came from a few different quarters some of which overlap

182
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
But the most interesting

183
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
Was a group of

184
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,223
Astronomers theologians

185
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,087
And cranks and keep in mind that those categories which week

186
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,671
Consider separate and distinct today we're not at this time

187
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
And so those

188
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
People

189
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
Changeable

190
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,047
That there was a Biblical basis

191
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
4

192
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
The end

193
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,191
And at that biblical basis was Mark

194
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,239
And the Great Pyramid of Giza

195
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
And the architecture of that

196
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,639
Mystery got more and more elaborate and gain a lot of followers

197
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:53,247
Has the astronomers and theologians combined scientific arguments with other

198
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,551
Wild and nonsensical ideas

199
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,111
Welded it all together into

200
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
What was for many people

201
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,975
Compelling argument that you abandon the Eng

202
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
And then all of the other way

203
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Weights and measures

204
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
Was it go against God's

205
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
So

206
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,959
Science in education with this new shiny measurement system

207
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
Verses religious zealot

208
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,031
Clean to what they know

209
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
Fearful of change

210
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,103
It's a good story

211
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
But it's only

212
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Harvest

213
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,503
In the US in the 1870s the real core system

214
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Came from a different Griffin tile

215
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,855
Some of the most Innovative Industrial

216
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
List of Dead die

217
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
The answer lies

218
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
With engine

219
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,303
And with machine tool industry in the late 19th and 20th centuries

220
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
Who had tooled-up

221
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Enormous

222
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,471
Vast factories in a vast industrial base

223
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
Dubai the 1870s

224
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
At the heart of what was now the large

225
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Army in the world

226
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,199
This vast industrial system included everything from lathe

227
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Two devices

228
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
For cutting screw threads

229
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
And it was all based on the edge

230
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,623
The manufacturers did not want to retool

231
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
They said it would be way too expensive

232
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
And not just that

233
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,767
They also argue that there was an intuitiveness

234
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
To the customary system

235
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
You have an inch

236
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
You have a half inch

237
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,167
Quarter inch 8 inch 16 and so on

238
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
That kind of division

239
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
On the shop floor

240
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
Maybe not for scientist on the shop floor mix

241
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
Huge amount of sense

242
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Very simple

243
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,711
It's very straightforward it's very easy to learn

244
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,271
Is very easy to build

245
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,807
Machines around that

246
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Concept

247
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,415
An older cuz everything is simply doubled or have

248
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,511
Arguments of these late 19th century industrialists

249
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,559
Proved incredibly influential

250
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:49,215
Put this into context this would be like today the tech sector in the titans of the tech sector pushing back

251
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
I can say

252
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
You know

253
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
Metric system over our dead body

254
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
And so the industrialist

255
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
And the Kranks

256
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Win this round

257
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,759
Subsequent Generations make attempts to introduce the metric system to the US

258
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
And the air mattress

259
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Subsequent generations of resistance

260
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,695
Congress repeatedly brings up legislation to make the metric system notice legal

261
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
Mandatory

262
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,047
And each time the legislation goes down in flames

263
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
The thin in the 1970s

264
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
About a hundred years after

265
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:23,519
First big push for metrication and on the back of a wave of metrication around the world

266
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,823
Another attempt is made to bring the Metra

267
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
System to the US

268
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
And this time

269
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
It really catches on

270
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:36,831
Congress actually passes in act in 1975 declaring the metric system the preferred system of weights and measures

271
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
The United States trade and commerce

272
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
And then President Gerald

273
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,463
Bows it up with an executive order

274
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,511
In both cases adoption of America

275
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
System is deemed

276
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
Voluntary

277
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,863
But the government really trying to make it happen

278
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:55,263
Take that America to they're in the metric way to simple system based on tens that you can start

279
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,663
Today is more accurate Universal to

280
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,063
The US Office of Education ren'py essays like

281
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
This one

282
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:13,183
People started painting take me to your leader buttons to the jackets

283
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
That's liter

284
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:22,143
Does a popular post to sell but teaching a woman in a bikini with the slogan think metric above her

285
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
And her measurements

286
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
In centimeters below

287
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
9261

288
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
92

289
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
Tent that you can be sexist in metric

290
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:36,479
To take 10 minutes

291
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,551
Cc200 or board

292
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,231
But the 1975 metric conversion act didn't really have any teeth

293
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
It included the word

294
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:53,375
Voluntary which meant that businesses and organizations could opt out of using it

295
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,471
There's some organizations and industries went metric and others did not

296
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,823
That decision to take a voluntary approach to metrication with

297
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,639
Difference in the way a lot of other countries approached it

298
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,967
But I talked actual laws and made it mandatory

299
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:13,343
Taking a softer approach meant that the US adoption remained incomplete

300
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
Invulnerable to opposition

301
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,487
Once again to Auntie metric forces began together

302
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,535
And once again this resistance

303
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
Came from multiple

304
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
Directions

305
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
For one they were the Union

306
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:31,519
Who escaped the moving to an International System of Measurement would make it easier for big corporations

307
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
The ship jobs offshore

308
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,639
Various writers and thinkers fought against the metric system to

309
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,967
People like author Tom Wolfe and futurist Stewart brand

310
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
The creator of the whole earth catalog

311
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
Rand argued that the US system was quote

312
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
More suited to humans

313
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,183
He pointed out that a human foot was about to linked

314
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:54,559
The foot and the yard was about the length of a person's outstretched arm to the center of their body

315
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,095
It was more intuitive

316
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
He said

317
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,447
And then finally there was also a political acumen

318
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
I can't see US going metric

319
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:08,639
As the Jimmy Carter of the mid-1970s gateway to the Reagan Era of the early 1980s

320
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,199
A variety of movements rise up against

321
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
Globalism and deleted

322
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
This is the issue of this Alexa

323
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:20,671
Why do we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution end

324
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
I confess that a little intellectual Elite

325
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
In a far distant capital

326
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,839
Can plan our lives for us better than we can plan the myself

327
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Beyond

328
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,703
The US economy was hurting and the nation's Pride had taken a few hits

329
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
And as a result

330
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
Anytime metric opposition began to take on

331
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
Kind of defiant

332
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
Nationalism

333
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Demetric

334
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,711
Campaign withered I think in the face of the

335
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
That's because it seemed to be

336
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
Yet another example

337
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
For conservative

338
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
Of the United States are selling out at

339
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Patrimony

340
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,487
2 ml largely Europeans that seems to have been the kind of xenophobic

341
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Subtext

342
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
You can imagine this

343
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,887
And we lost in Vietnam and now we're going to

344
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
Adopt the metric system what is the world coming through that's

345
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
What

346
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,335
This was sort of perceived as it was the pendulum swinging too far

347
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
To this kind of

348
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Namby-pamby International

349
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,223
That sounds weirdly familiar

350
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,575
An old basement that efforts to metric height u.s. Willis stranded

351
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
Halfway between the old and the new

352
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,183
I need the typically American why

353
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,975
It was left up to the market

354
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,535
To decide who went metric and who didn't

355
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,351
Which has led to this weed situation where

356
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Get these

357
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,959
The US is already about halfway there

358
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,775
That us really is metric Nation

359
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
We just don't know that where I'm at

360
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Truck Nation

361
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:49,247
Sally Mitchell is a high school chemistry and physics teacher in Upstate New York and a passionate advocate for the

362
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
The metric system

363
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,367
I mean she's even written a metric cookbook we use the metric system

364
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
Everywhere

365
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
Liquor stores

I have a water bottle here right now it's 500 ml

369
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
It's there

370
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
It's just our choice

371
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,823
I can look at this bottle and see 16.9 fluid ounces I can choose to read 1.05 pi

372
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Or I can choose to read

373
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
500ml

374
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,991
The US is on what's called a metric continuum

375
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
The fields of science and medicine almost

376
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,855
Polymetric hated then with little controversy

377
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,671
But in the business realm it's a mix

378
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,487
Some businesses fully matriculated

379
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
Not at all

380
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
And a lot of left

381
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,327
Somewhere in between

382
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
Here in the United States we have

383
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
Large international business

384
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,007
Elizabeth Gentry is symmetric coordinator in the office of whites

385
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
And measures at nist

386
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,615
The National Institute of Standards and Technology

387
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,175
Nist is the organization that

388
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,735
Standardized measurement in the US

389
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
These are

390
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Companies that

391
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
Have international

392
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,343
Supply chain

393
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:02,719
What they're looking for is the ability to sell their product and many marketplaces and they get

394
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,559
The components for the product all around the world and I need to fit together

395
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
And how about really reliable products

396
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:15,263
These are companies like Xerox and caterpillar and Levi Strauss and they went metric during metrication push back in the nineteenth

397
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,335
And then you have on the other end of the spectrum

398
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
Small business

399
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
What's the score in the United States

400
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
Anthony's

401
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,015
Small local businesses the economic imperative to Metrotech

402
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
Just isn't there

403
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,087
Like think of a Dairy Farmer

404
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,391
And it's just one thing that really holds

405
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
Back is milk

406
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
And milk comes in a gallon

407
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,279
And milk is not shipped

408
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,863
Internationally so the farmer can't afford

409
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,911
To retool everything

410
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,983
Put it into leaders and so it's been a gallon

411
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:51,871
Yet another unit that confused our Intrepid Australian reporter Joel when he shopped in American grocery stores

412
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,967
Back home Joe's milk comes in litres not gallons half gallons in quarts

413
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,039
And it's it's funny because most people don't know

414
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
Fort and leader

415
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Which ones

416
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,695
Yeah I thought I'd say which ones

417
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Yeah I have no idea

418
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
Well this is how you remember it

419
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
A leader

420
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
Is a leader bit more

421
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
Fantastic

422
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,079
Sorry you've got the huge multinationals on one end of the spectrum

423
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,639
And then the Dairy Farmers in Hypoluxo

424
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Smoothies

425
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
It's on the other

426
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,759
But you both took a lot of business caught somewhere in between

427
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,551
Which is where it gets really tricky

428
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,623
Some companies end up having to maintain

429
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,951
Two separate production lines even two separate warehouses

430
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,767
To manage all the different versions of their products

431
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
It's a total headache

432
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
Expensive to

433
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
So that's where we're at

434
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:53,567
We got a nation stretched out across a Continuum of metrication dual units and conversion confusion

435
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,383
History of near-misses bad timing

436
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,783
And it's all mixed in with a serious cultural resistance to the system of measurement adopted around the world

437
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:09,183
This cultural resistance highlights the difficulties of introducing a new system of measurement anywhere

438
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,487
Even the average French citizen

439
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
Hated than you

440
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,839
System but it was first introduced back in the revolution real

441
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
The bottom line is this

442
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,215
It's really difficult to get people to change from a measurement system

443
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,495
We've been using their whole life

444
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Inertia

445
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
Resistance to change

446
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,335
Is a massive obstacle

447
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
To overcome

448
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
Yeah when I think about

449
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:33,503
Alright what's harder occupying a country conquering it and putting it under your

450
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,855
Coquille or getting a new adopter unit of weights and measures that you can do the first

451
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,159
The second one can really

452
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Rizzoli

453
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
Rough you up because it

454
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
It's even if people do it

455
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,143
On the face of it they're constantly converting back into the to the ghost units that are

456
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
That have been banned

457
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
Discontinue

458
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
How to do it

459
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:59,615
But resistance to the metric system in the US continues to have a subtext that goes beyond just preferring a familiar

460
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Your system

461
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,431
Today maybe more than ever

462
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,271
Resistance to metric is about the rise of a new kind of national

463
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
North Country

464
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,367
Take the case of Sally Mitchell who you heard from earlier

465
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,439
She's the high school science teacher from upstate New York

466
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
Back in 2014 GMC step

467
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,839
Right into the middle of the whole metric vs. US units debate

468
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
Moka bros

469
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:26,239
It actually started out in Syracuse when the airport had gotten a new sign

470
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:32,127
Syracuse airport is an international airport and the old sign and display the temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius

471
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
The Matrix

472
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
Systems preferred unit

473
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,015
But the Selfies option had been activated on this new sign

474
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
Is only showing Fahrenheit

475
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:45,951
So I called and they said I'll be forgot to program it let me do it'll be ready by tomorrow and I think I posted

476
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,743
Did something online it said

477
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
Don't you worry

478
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
It'll be fixed by tomorrow

479
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:58,239
And then the next thing you know what the newspaper with calling me and they wanted to do a story on this I said no no

480
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Not a story

481
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,055
Please don't know her story on this

482
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,847
But they did a story anyway

483
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
And then a radio station

484
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,175
Cold and did an interview with

485
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,015
And a host of that radio show with decidedly antimatter

486
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,855
And they said do you want a teacher that wants to drill her

487
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,672
Metric agenda into people's heads

488
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,744
How dare she and things like that

489
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,304
And they were mean and they were awful

490
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,608
Next thing you know it phone calls

491
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
School I had

492
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,936
Threats on Facebook

493
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
Threats through email

494
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,800
I had people writing to me demanding that I be

495
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
Tired

496
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,920
Because I just wanted the sign to display Celsius again

497
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
It got really crazy

498
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
The threats were so bad

499
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,552
And I had to report that to the police

500
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,648
And I thought wow people need to get a life or something or

501
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
Or really

502
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,512
Why why are you doing this I'm doing this

503
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:57,632
For science I'm doing this for International Communication I'm doing this as an educator

504
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:03,008
Sometimes When Sally Mitchell talks about the metric system you get the sense she's talking about

505
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
A lot more than the Metro

506
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,848
People like me

507
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
Are starting to speak

508
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,432
And we're not going to have it anymore

509
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,528
This is not the way we are wearing intelligent Nation

510
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:20,928
And we want what's best for our children we want what's best for our communities around us

511
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,280
And so that's why I'm speaking up now I'm more vocal than I

512
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Ever

513
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Ever been

514
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,864
And I'm just not going to take it anymore

515
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,424
I'm not going to let the ignorant

516
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Beeville Audi

517
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,152
But those antiemetic trolls that Sally had to deal with

518
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,480
She's pretty much guaranteed to have the last laugh

519
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,832
Because those customer US units inches and pounds

520
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,880
Actually defined

521
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
Relative to the metrics

522
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,488
Keys Elizabeth Gentry of mystogan

523
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
Usually

524
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,792
Consumers are

525
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:01,120
They're at the grocery store they made by a gallon of milk

526
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:05,728
Or they're at the gas station and they buy a gallon of gas they think well

527
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,824
I'm using all of these us customary units all the time in my life

528
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,664
That must mean the United States hasn't really adopted the metric system

529
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,320
But the system that make sure I gallon of gas in Oakland is the same as a gallon of gas in Omaha

530
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,392
That system relies on Metric standard

531
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
A gallon is officially defined as

532
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,304
3.78541178

533
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
So just below the surface

534
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
Metro

535
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
It's metric

536
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
All the way down

537
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,712
You might think the debate about the metric system is over in the US

538
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:52,320
Candidate in the most recent Democratic primary actually ran on a pro metric

539
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Platform

540
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Weather alert

541
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
He did not get very far

542
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
What about that

543
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Ravenous

544
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
Between the beats

545
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,840
Bongs and Charter of our devices

546
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
We're immersed

547
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,168
The cluttered World a man-made sound

548
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
If

549
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,800
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

550
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:18,688
