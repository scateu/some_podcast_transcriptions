I'm Roman Mars

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,184
On the evening of May 31st 2009

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,976
216 passengers

32
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:40,608
3 pilots and 9 flight attendants boarded in the Air France flight in Rio De Janeiro Brazil

33
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,936
The flight was headed across the Atlantic Ocean to Paris

34
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:49,568
The warning this story might not be a good one to listen to if you're sitting on a plane right now

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,408
Best producer Katie mingle letting you know that the closest exit

36
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
Could be behind you

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,272
The plane that took off that evening from Rio with an Airbus

38
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
Free xxx

39
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:04,928
The take-off was unremarkable the plane reached a cruising altitude of 35000

40
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,024
Passengers read and watched movies and slept

41
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:14,144
As they flew over the Atlantic Ocean passing the equator a lot of thunderstorm activity

42
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,704
Quite typical nothing really unusual

43
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
About that

44
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:23,104
That's William long of Isha he wrote an article for Vanity Fair about this flight and has written

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,152
Extensively about Aviation

46
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,200
He also used to be a pilot

47
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
So I spent

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,856
Many many thousands of hours in cockpits

49
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
Tell the story of Air France

50
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
Flight 447

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
Is a long flight

52
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,560
So they had to co-pilots

53
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,376
I noticed first officers and one cap

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,936
They would fly the plane in chef

55
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
Student flight

56
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,080
We know that the flight proceeded normally for several hours

57
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,176
And then then with no communication

58
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
To the ground or air traffic

59
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Troll

60
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
It suddenly disappeared

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,184
Some pieces of the plane and several bodies were found Days Later floating in the Atlantic

62
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,048
But it would be two more years before most of the wreckage was found deep in the ocean

63
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,120
All 228 people on board had died

64
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,008
When the wreckage was found they also recovered the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorders

65
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
And they were in good shape

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,944
The recordings were able to tell the story about how flight 447 ended up in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean

67
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,016
And the story they told was about what happened

68
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,856
When the automated system flying the plane suddenly shut off

69
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
And the pilots were left

70
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Prize

71
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
Confused

72
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,512
An ultimately unable to fly their own plane

73
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,424
Automation in flight has been around for a long time

74
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:57,056
The first so-called autopilot was invented by the Sperry Corporation in 1912

75
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,384
And it allowed the plane to fly straight and level

76
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,992
Without the Pilot's intervention in the 1950s the auto Pilots got better

77
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,064
So that you could program an autopilot the following route

78
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Notjustok

79
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
Keep the wings level

80
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,928
And this was making the Pilot's job a lot easier

81
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,768
But there was still a lot to think about in the cockpit of an airplane

82
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
Control

83
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Hydraulic

84
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,679
And because of all this most planes had three people in the cockpit

85
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Two pilots

86
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
An engineer

87
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:31,871
Flight engineer sat behind the Pilot's and they manipulated and manage these

88
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
Increasingly complex systems

89
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,527
But by the 1970s all of those complex systems were also automated

90
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,831
In Flight Engineers lost their necessity

91
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,671
By this time the jet engine have replaced

92
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
The piston engine

93
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
Making claims much more reliable

94
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
And Sons were showing that most

95
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,375
Accidents were being caused not by mechanical error

96
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
But by human error

97
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,311
In a French company called Airbus thought that they can make planes safer by letting automation carry an even bigger

98
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,103
You're part of the burden of lying

99
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
Airbus was a leader

100
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
Airbus has always been quite radical

101
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
Unix design philosophy

102
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
Led by a guy named Bernard Ziegler

103
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,391
Airbus set out to design what they hoped would be the safest plane yet

104
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,695
Plane that even the worst pilot

105
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
Fly with ease

106
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,815
Bernard Ziegler he famously said

107
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
But he was building an airplane that his concierge

108
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:33,823
Ziegler's playing not only had autopilot it also had what's called a fly-by-wire system

109
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
But basically an autopilot just does

110
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
That's what a pilot tells it

111
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
To do

112
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,783
Fly-by-wire is a computer-based

113
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,879
Control system that can interpret what the pilot wants to do

114
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
And then do it smoothly and safely

115
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,767
So if the pilot pulls back on his or hers

116
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Stick

117
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
The fly-by-wire system will say

118
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,631
I see that you want to pitch up

119
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
And here

120
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
I'll do it for you

121
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,471
Adjust the right angle and rate

122
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:07,871
Importantly the fly-by-wire system will also protect you from getting into an aerodynamic stall

123
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,943
Are assault happens when the engine stops turning

124
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
But in a plane stalling is different

125
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
Basically getting so slow

126
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,319
That the

127
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
Wings no longer function correctly in the airplane

128
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Loses out

129
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:25,023
A stall in a plane can happen when the nose of the plane is picked up at

130
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Too steep an angle

131
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,887
Steep angle can cause the plane to lose lift

132
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
And start

133
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,423
To descend

134
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,727
Stalling in a plane is not good

135
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,031
Stop it long enough and you will crash

136
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,359
But fly-by-wire automation makes it impossible to do

137
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
As long as it's on

138
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
Unlike autopilot

139
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,735
Fly-by-wire system cannot be

140
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
Turn on and off

141
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
By the pilot

142
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,087
You can't turn this automation off

143
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,159
Here's the thing they can turn itself off

144
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,511
And that's exactly what it did on May 31st 2009

145
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:01,375
Best Buy 4470 through the night sky over the Atlantic Ocean

146
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
At some point

147
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
Having flown

148
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
Normally for

149
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
A few hours

150
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
The captain

151
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
I don't back to sleep

152
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
This meant the to Copilot

153
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
That's where in control of the plane

154
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
They

155
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,807
Encountered some weather it wasn't rough

156
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
Are they deaf never hit significant turbulence

157
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
So far nothing out of the ordinary

158
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
And then

159
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Suddenly

160
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
They lost

161
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
AirSpeed indications

162
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
A pressure Probe on the outside of the plane had iced over the automation could no longer tell how fast the plane was going

163
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,543
At this point autopilot disconnect it at the same time the fly-by-wire system

164
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Degraded

165
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,735
Like one step so the autopilot turned off and the fly-by-wire system shifted into a different

166
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,575
Mode a mode that did not protect against aerodynamic stall

167
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:57,951
None of this was ideal but it also wasn't a reason to panic according to William

168
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,767
The plane was still basically flying straight

169
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Unsteady

170
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
The airplane was not upset

171
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
Had they done nothing

172
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
They would have done exactly

173
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
What they needed to do nothing

174
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,751
But that's not what has

175
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,591
The co-pilot in the right seat put his hand on his control stick

176
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
A little joystick like thing to his right

177
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
And he pulled it back

178
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,039
Not just a little he pulled it 3/4 of the way back

179
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
Why he did that

180
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Is

181
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
The major question

182
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,719
Perhaps he was startled or reacting to some

183
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Turbulence

184
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,791
It's important to note that he did not

185
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,839
Tell the other pilot in the cockpit

186
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
The guy in the left seat what do you do

187
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Just done

188
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
If you had

189
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,007
Maybe his co-pilot would have known the dangerous situation they were about

190
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
2bn

191
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,175
In an Airbus the two pilots have separate control sticks that move independently of each other

192
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,575
In other commercial airplanes the controls would move in unison so that you actually feel the moves your co-pilot was making

193
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
On their controls

194
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:03,743
This design variation they also have contributed to what was about to become a very bad situation

195
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,583
In any case has the pilot in the right seat pulled back on his deck

196
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
The airplane

197
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,935
Old put his nose up and started to soar upward

198
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,871
Install protections are in place the plane won't just warned you not to pitch it it's an extreme angle a physical

199
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
We will not let you do it

200
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,527
Remember the plane it shifted into a mode in which it wasn't offering that underline protection

201
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:32,927
Every angle that steeper and steeper the air can flow smoothly across the wings and the plane begin

202
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
And the stall

203
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:40,351
The plane was angled up trying to gain altitude but it actually began to lose altitude

204
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:45,727
The plane couldn't prevent a stall but it could still warm that's always happening

205
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,567
It's at stall stall stall

206
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,383
Stole stole

207
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Soul Stone

208
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:00,063
And you think that if you heard this alarm someone would say hey I think we might be stalling

209
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,927
But this never happened did say

210
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
But he didn't say we've stalled

211
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:13,375
Indian man in the right seat we was flying the airplane the junior copilot you put the nose down a couple times then bring it right back

212
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
Look up again

213
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,799
The copilot's began to ring frantically for the captain to come into the cockpit at one point one of them says

214
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:25,407
Where is he here playing with shaking all kinds of alarms were going off

215
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,039
1 minute and 38 seconds after the episode started the captain came into the cockpit and asked

216
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
What's going on

217
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:37,183
The copilot's did not say we're in a stall instead one of them said

218
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Quotes

219
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
Completely lost control of the air

220
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
And we don't understand

221
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
We tried

222
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Everything

223
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,215
The captain have walked into a difficult scene to under

224
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
1st and everyone was

225
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,311
Confused where they descending or climbing

226
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,615
At times it couldn't seem to figure it out

227
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,199
Finally they seem to realize they're in a fast descent

228
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,503
Losing thousands of feet per minute

229
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,319
But why they couldn't figure out why

230
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,623
The captain never assessed

231
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,415
Correctly what was going on

232
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:12,767
He was obviously trying to it wasn't there to drink coffee or suck his thumb

233
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,631
But he was never able to figure out what was going on even though it should have been

234
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,679
Amply obviously

235
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Going on

236
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,543
But for whatever reason it wasn't obvious to them what was going on

237
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
They didn't know they were in a stall

238
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
They realize it William says

239
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,711
The fix would have been clear its basic

240
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
Pilot School 101

241
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,599
The recovery would have required them to put the nose down

242
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
Power doesn't matter

243
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
Get the nose down get a below the horizon

244
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
We're game at flying speed

245
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,303
And then pull out of the ensuing.

246
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:52,959
The plane continued falling down at a jaw-dropping pace losing several thousands of feet per minute

247
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,775
But since they started at 37000 feet

248
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,847
For a while there was still time for a recovering

249
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
So for quite a long time

250
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
Is a normal crew

251
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
I would have been able to recover

252
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,831
And at the very end around 16000 be the best crew in the world

253
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,135
Only probably would have been able to recover

254
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
And below that out

255
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
No crew

256
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
Would have been able to

257
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:20,351
Recover cuz they simply didn't have the space beneath them to execute the die before hitting the water

258
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
But in any case they never try to do it

259
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,775
Until the road this airplane down

260
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
Expressing confusion the whole time

261
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
And finally expressing

262
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
Certainly that they were going to die

263
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
4 minutes

264
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
And 22nd

265
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
After the incident started

266
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
They pancakes

267
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,367
Into the water at a very high descent rate

268
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
And of course it kill everyone instead

269
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
6 years after the crash of flight 440

270
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,543
7 what's clear is that the pilots didn't understand what was

271
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
Happening to them

272
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
The big question is

273
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
How

274
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
How could they have a computer yelling

275
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,735
Stall at them a not understand they were in the stall

276
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:16,415
There were various things that contributed to the crash of 447 but automation which is overwhelmingly made airline travel

277
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Safer

278
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
Also played a role in this accident

279
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,279
However much automation

280
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Has

281
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
Help

282
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
The airline

283
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
By increasing safety

284
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
It is had some negative consequence

285
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
In this case

286
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
It's quite clear

287
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,711
That these Pilots had had experience stripped away from them

288
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
4 years

289
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
William actually did the math on this

290
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,695
The captain of the Air France flight had log 346 hours of flying over the past 6 months

291
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
But of that time

292
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,583
There were only about four hours in which he was actually in control of an airplane

293
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
Takeoffs and Landings

294
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
The rest of the time

295
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
Autopilot was flying a plane

296
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
Pets 4 hours

297
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
In 6 months

298
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,591
The co-pilot would have had even less time at the controls

299
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:12,479
This is not to say Pilots do nothing when autopilot is on they still have an important role to play

300
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
What's a good pilot

301
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
What to do in flight

302
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
They watch the systems

303
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,623
They handle navigation and communication

304
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
They

305
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
Occasionally

306
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:26,047
Program things in flight path changes a deal with anticipation of weather

307
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
They think about fuel management

308
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
Increasingly Williams us

309
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:35,263
Pilots have become automation managers with fewer and fewer chances to actually fly the plane

310
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,663
He believes this lack of experience at the controls let the pilots of 447 unprepared to take over when

311
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Automation turned off

312
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
Pilots were hideously in combat

313
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
That's

314
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
I think no one would disagree with that

315
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,927
So I have certain you heard that

316
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
Position from other people before

317
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,047
I think we all have to be very careful none of us was there when the

318
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Sex rehab

319
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
That's Nadine Sartor a systems engineer at the University of Michigan who studied a lot of aviation accident

320
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
Related to automation

321
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
My approach to things is different I guess

322
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:14,687
These Pilots were in that airplane with the passengers and I'm sure they had every motivation

323
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
To keep that flight safe

324
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,319
And yet they didn't say so then I try to understand why why did they not

325
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,135
Did they not have the right information that they not have

326
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
The proper training

327
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:30,559
When one of the co-pilot called back on a stick he pitched the plane into an angle that eventually caused the stall

328
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,959
But it's possible he didn't understand that he was now flying in a different mode one that would not regulate and

329
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,751
Smooth out his movements

330
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:43,103
This confusion about how the fly-by-wire system responds in different modes

331
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
This is referred to as

332
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Athlete has

333
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Mudkip

334
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,479
And it's come up in other

335
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,575
The plane switches into a different mode on suddenly

336
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
Pilots funny gif

337
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,159
Youku to understand what's going on at that

338
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,951
Pointy do not exactly know

339
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,767
Whether the system is still taking care of the airplane

340
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:07,167
Or whether they're in charge now they don't necessarily understand whether all of it has disconnected or just part

341
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,775
Parts of food have disconnected a lot of what is happening is hidden from View

342
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
From the pilots

343
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
It's buried

344
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,383
But the airplane starts doing something

345
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
That is unexpected

346
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,503
And the pilot says hey what's but now it now wouldn't it would now it's

347
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Doing

348
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,599
That's a very very standard comment in cock

349
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
What's it up to now

350
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:34,559
The pilots of Air France flight 447 never quite say what's it doing now but they say similar things

351
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:39,679
William wasn't the only person to point out that what's it doing now is it commonly heard

352
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Good question in the cockpit

353
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519
It seems to be almost a running joke

354
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
Look in the industry

355
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
A joke that everyone agrees

356
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
Is a serious problem

357
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,455
What's the most often asked question in our cockpit

358
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
Best American Airlines

359
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:02,463
Captain Warren Vanderburgh addressing a group of pilots in 1997

360
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,279
People have been talking about this issue way before the

361
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
The crash of flight 440

362
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,655
7 it's just that no one's really figured out how to solve it yet

363
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,263
We have become what I call Children of the magenta

364
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,663
The children of the magenta are too dependent on The Guiding magenta colored lines on their screens

365
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,735
No we think we have to have those magenta lines on the map

366
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,063
And that magenta vbar that steering us for that line

367
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,903
The children of the magenta are too dependent on Automation in general

368
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,351
Vanderburgh recommends in certain situations

369
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,911
Turn off the autopilot and fly the plane mirror

370
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
Can you deem the situation is right

371
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,567
The practice your skills

372
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,407
Turn off your autopilot

373
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
Fly your plane

374
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
Maintain your skills

375
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
Knitting starter agrees that

376
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:06,463
She also recommends more and better training using simulators to let Pilots explore different kinds of emergencies

377
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Scenarios

378
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
And then of course there are people who think the problem can be solved with more and better automation but this is a

379
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
Paradox of automation

380
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,983
Automation accommodates in Compton

381
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,031
In fact it's designed to do that

382
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:25,407
The Airbus was designed after all for Bernard Ziegler's concierge to be able to fly

383
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
We appear to be locked into a cycle

384
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,015
In which automation

385
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
Begets

386
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
The erosion of skills

387
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
Or the lack of skills in the first

388
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
When this then begets more automate

389
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
Maybe Insider things

390
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
It's a mistake

391
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
To throw more automation at the problem

392
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,911
The position I would have dropped is one that has been termed a human centered automation

393
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,007
Where we see what you need to do instead is make the animation that you have

394
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
We could eat me be smarter

395
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,871
But importantly maked what we call a team player

396
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
End

397
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,479
Part of that is to provide better feedback part of it is

398
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,807
Have you automation communicate more effectively with the pilot

399
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
No one I talked

400
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,903
Two is advocating going back to the bad old days

401
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
For automation

402
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,511
To Automation in January the fly-by-wire systems

403
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,839
All of those certainly do increase safety I would argue

404
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
And even though a lot of the exit

405
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,471
Since we see these days have to do with the interaction between pilots

406
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
And automation

407
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
William says

408
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
You have to remember

409
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,895
One of the reasons for that is that because of automation there hardly any other accent

410
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
And as far as how we should

411
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
I feel about Air France

412
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,295
Flight 447 and other acts

413
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
Involving animation

414
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:42,463
Should they be seen as an acceptable loss in an industry that's become mostly safer

415
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Through automation

416
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,327
I think as a society the answer to that is yes

417
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
You know

418
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,935
For the individuals there's no such thing as an accept

419
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Civil laws

420
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
Alright I'm in this weather

421
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Terrible trash

422
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,055
Terrible in for the pilots who died as well

423
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:02,943
Airbus planes are not any less safe for any more safe than any other plane on the market

424
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
Planes have accidents

425
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
But it should be sad

426
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,623
That they're pretty safe to the accident rate for air travel is very low

427
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,719
About 2.8 accidents for every 1 million departures

428
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:19,839
And there are plenty of Pilots out there that know how to take control in an emergency

429
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,143
Abbreviate everyone just with

430
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
Tony okay

431
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,983
It's true there are lots of good pilot

432
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
What's out there

433
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,591
But in a far-off future we might be flying and pilot list

434
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
We're a long way from that

435
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,711
But the technology is definitely coming

436
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:40,063
And we will this will happen it just makes a lot of sense

437
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,415
I don't think anyone is sort of loudly saying great that this could be a wonderful thing

438
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,231
But I think reason why people are not

439
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,535
Are also not tearing your hair out about

440
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:54,655
Because by the time it happens the automation will be so good and so reliable

441
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,727
The humans with all of our human emotions

442
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263
Human fallibility

443
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
The children of the magenta

444
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
Oh really

445
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
Just be in the way

446
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,184
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Katie mingle with Sam Greenspan Avery trufelman and me Roman Ma

447
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,584
We relied heavily on the reporting and expertise of William long of you show for this piece of special thanks to him he would

448
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,984
Above and beyond for us and if you wanted even more in-depth a minute-by-minute analysis of the crash of flight 447

449
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,568
Check out his piece in Vanity Fair it's called the human factor

450
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,504
And on the next episode of 99% invisible we're going to take him this idea of the automation Paradox and use it as a lens to

451
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,904
View the next great design Challenge and automation when we all potentially become the children of the magenta

452
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
When are self-driving cars

453
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,256
It's our first two part Series so stay tuned

454
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:03,520
Now last week I mentioned that we have a new addition to the radiotopia collective and I'm pleased to announce that Nate dimeo The Memory Palace

455
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
Is doing the game

456
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
When I was first

457
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,968
Thinking about starting 99percentinvisible Nate was one of the first people I called because I really loved what he was doing with the show

458
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,528
Between these poignant historical moments

459
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,088
And I wanted to do something in the same spirit

460
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
Stories about design

461
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,024
And so more than any other program I can say if you love 99percentinvisible you will love love

462
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
The Memory Palace

463
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,376
They are friends and he wants recommended history book to me

464
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,192
An unpaid 325i noticed a couple sentences

465
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,472
Just a couple of sentences

466
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
That work

467
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,824
A tiny but really striking digression from the main narrative

468
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,480
And I'd like to think that I would have noticed the charm of its historical footnote on my own but the real reason it stood out to me was good

469
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,808
I knew it sparked an episode of The Memory Palace

470
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,392
Most Memory Palace pieces start on page 325 or some book

471
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:57,536
I'm what you just heard is Nate dimeo The Memory Palace has a special way of zeroing in on these moments in history

472
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,584
The light up your imagination in

473
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
Hit you in the gut

474
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,144
Or make you smile

475
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,216
I have noticed that there were these historical things that would jump out

476
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,544
From Longview no Ken Burns documentaries or

477
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,896
The One Moment In some historic home tour when like at that object on

478
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,200
The mantelpiece like actually jumps onto

479
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
Is wow that's amazing

480
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,552
Beautiful

481
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,136
The things that move me where these focused things they were

482
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,464
Recognizing the single object they were using credible twist

483
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,512
Someone story

484
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:32,352
And I wanted to find out on some level if there was a way

485
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
2

486
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,216
Cut to the chase if there was a way to focus so tightly

487
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
Aesthetic

488
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,824
The artistic challenge like is there a way that I can

489
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,640
Replicate this feeling of being moved

490
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,200
Or having my you know head blown off

491
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Or

492
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,248
Having my heart broken

493
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,040
The Sting that like I have once.

494
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
Is there a way that I can

495
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,368
Get people to feel that same thing

496
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
Can I

497
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
Retell the story

498
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,744
In such a way that they don't have to take the whole historic home tour

499
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,328
Or they don't have to sit through all nine and a half hours of this documentary series

500
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,632
Is there a way to to crystallize

501
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,424
Internist

502
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
Sweeping historical

503
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Full story into

504
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Pop song

505
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:15,872
But the Memory Palace is never just a simple historical anecdote there's always something more going on

506
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
There is a subject and then there is meaning

507
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,224
Like there aren't there are scenes which is different

508
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,040
Plot the sum of all I'm not merely trying to

509
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,112
You know Talent historical story I'm trying to conjure it

510
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,720
In the listener's mind

511
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
4 bit

512
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
And then Melt Away

513
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,352
I really liked his show so much that had a hard time

514
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
Selecting which episode 2% so

515
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,544
I asked Nate which episode really stood out to him as the one that did all the things he was hoping to achieve and Memory Palace

516
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Any pic

517
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
This episode

518
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Enjoy

519
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,664
This is the Memory Palace

520
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
I need to mail

521
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
The rule of Two Worlds

522
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
Despair

523
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,832
In the exposition universelle in Paris

524
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
1889

525
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,464
The exhibits in the grounds were unparalleled

526
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
An impact

527
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,816
Let the center of it all was this issue steel structure

528
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,864
It managed to be imposing

529
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
In Elgin

530
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,448
In the tallest thing on earth in unmistakably free

531
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
French all at once

532
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,544
Paris have the Eiffel Tower

533
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,592
In the man planning the next fair

534
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
The Columbian

535
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
Position in Chicago

536
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
Just a couple of years away

537
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
Needed something bad

538
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,992
Good

539
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,528
Something Eiffel Tower

540
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
And that wasn't easy to find

541
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:37,792
The proposals ran from the ridiculous like a structure that would soar more than a thousand feet above the Land of Lincoln made in Thai

542
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,608
Harley out-of-stock logs in top with a replica

543
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
Of age boy at home

544
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,544
To the extra ridiculous something so tall that visitors would take an elevator to the top of a slide that they

545
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,104
Drop them off in New York

546
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
The fair's organizers

547
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
We're panicking

548
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,296
They demanded the Americas designers and Engineers Step Up

549
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
In a man named Jorge Perez

550
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Step forward

551
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,232
When his Ferris wheel was completed that summer

552
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,304
Did Rose 264 feet above the ground

553
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
Which was a lot shorter than the Eiffel

554
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
Tower

555
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
But whatever

556
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
Didn't even move

557
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
The idea that something so massive

558
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
But that

559
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
Looks so fresh

560
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,592
Like a bicycle wheel spokes look

561
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Too thin to bike

562
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
Thrilling

563
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
Imprint terrifying

564
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
Despite what the engineer said

565
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,552
Despite the math and laws of physics

566
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,368
Despite the many assurances of the fair is organized

567
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:39,488
There were people who were sure that this Ludacris machine was going to be a disaster

568
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
People going to die

569
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,168
Not only was there no way that that flimsy thing could stand up to a Prairie Wind or Gala

570
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
The lake

571
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
Even if it did

572
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,568
The prospect of tumbling through the air in a cage 20 stories above Chicago

573
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
Mulan craziness

574
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,664
Who in their right mind was going to wanna ride

575
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
Hundreds of thousands of

576
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
Despite the fact that during its first test

577
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:10,208
Hundreds of bolts in loose Parts rain down on Spectators below

578
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,768
Despite real stories of panic Riders

579
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,120
Trying to escape Through the Windows when they realized exactly how high 200 feet

580
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,936
Despite apocryphal stories

581
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Suicide

582
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
Can severed limbs

583
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
Ferris wheel

584
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,592
This thing is basically a kiddie ride today

585
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:31,200
Was a bigger Thrill Ride than any quintuple Loop open Carver Swiss Rock

586
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,224
Poster they might have

587
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
The papers

588
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:41,184
Even someone France said it was the Marvel of the age

589
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
Better than the Eiffel Tower

590
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,888
That almost mundane sensation we have now if looking down from above

591
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,472
The moving through space now

592
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
Down and back around

593
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,080
Nuna never felt this things before

594
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384

Be back in 1893

Climb into a car right after sunset

600
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,536
During the golden hour

601
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,840
And experienced something entirely new

602
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,424
You can rise up above the world fair
