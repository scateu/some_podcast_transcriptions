I'm Roman Mars

30
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,208
We are in the middle of wildfire season here in California

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,792
There are more than a dozen currently burning across the state

32
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,120
And so we're dedicating two episodes to this issue

33
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,680
Last week weeks for the work of Jack Cohen

34
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:50,080
He's a forest service scientist who back in the 1980s started to argue that instead of fighting fires

35
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,944
We should focus more energy on building homes that were better designed to withstand fire

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
He helped Define and popularized the idea of defensible space which is the buffer you should create between

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
Building on your property

38
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,208
In the grass trees and other flammable materials that surround it

39
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,280
This week we're going to spend time in one community

40
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
In Southern California

41
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:15,168
Which is frequently threatened by fire and is grappling with what it means to rebuild

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Uber

43
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,472
And over again

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,968
When Daryl Cagle move to Montecito California as a kid in 1964 it was a quiet town

45
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,808
The kind of place where his single mother who worked as a school teacher

46
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
To buy a house

47
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,928
Montecito used to be a very normal neighborhood

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,280
Normal people with normal jobs could afford to affordable houses there

49
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
Montecito has changed a lot since

50
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,168
It's now famously home to Rob Lowe and Oprah

51
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,496
And not so many single mothers and school teachers

52
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:56,384
The housing prices of fun crazy and the demographics of town or just

53
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
Probably extreme

54
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,736
But it's a lovely place and it's

55
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
Where I grew up at

56
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,832
Very comforting to

57
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
To be in the place

58
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
That is so

59
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Familiar

60
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,768
Nestled between the mountains and the Pacific right next to Santa Barbara

61
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,816
Montecito is very Charming

62
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,120
And very geographically isolated

63
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,936
I can see why so many celebrities want to live there

64
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,472
At Susie Cagle

65
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,544
The reporter for our story this week and Daryl's daughter

66
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:30,944
The landscape is this mix of desert and Coast with soaring Hills natural hot springs and cool doing morning

67
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,016
The hillsides are covered with Evergreen Chaparral

68
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
A plant Community characterized by scrubby brush

69
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,136
The neighborhoods are lined with fragrant eucalyptus

70
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,280
Montecito's beautiful landscape is also what makes the community especially vulnerable

71
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
To Wildfire

72
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:51,680
The native Chaparral covering the hills is drought and relatively fire-resistant for the first

73
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984
20 years or so of its life

74
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
Then it dries out

75
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Too rich

76
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
Fire fuel

77
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,640
Then there's invasive eucalyptus trees

78
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,480
The Shaggy Bark and flammable oils make them burst into fire balls

79
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,272
The heat up during wildfire

80
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
They look like matchsticks when they catch

81
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,600
And pieces of their bark

82
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,160
Fly off to start other places nearby

83
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,744
The Slender Canyons that sit below the hilltops of Montecito

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,327
Our cozy little spaces where that fire can easily take hold

85
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,167
Which it does when the town so-called Sundowner winds

86
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,519
Blow hot dry air from the desert up over the mountains and through the canyon

87
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,127
The region indoors a major fire once every 10 years or so

88
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,247
Dear my dad and grandmother moved to Montecito in 1964

89
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
Wildfire called the coyote fire

90
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,879
Scorch 67000 Acres just north of them

91
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,207
Heyburn 206 homes in killed one firefighter

92
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
My dad says he doesn't remember it

93
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:54,911
For this landscape fire is predictable and it is inevitable and coupled with a multi-year drought

94
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,215
It's becoming unmanageable

95
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,055
We had no idea that fires were going to increase

96
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
Insights and frequency like they have

97
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,479
Maybe it's like the frog in the pot slowly coming to a boil

98
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
It's just

99
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Getting worse slowly

100
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,743
For decades my dad and grandmother and the other residents

101
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:25,631
Montecito exhibited a kind of stubborn Pioneer streak that characterizes a lot of California

102
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,727
After fires they rebuild and continue with our lives

103
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,079
My grandmother had been driven from her home in Texas by the drought in the 30s

104
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
AdSense

105
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,919
So many Dust Bowl refugees fleeing for a better life

106
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
So what was a little fire

107
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,343
But that kind of optimism is getting harder to sustain as far as become more frequent and more intense

108
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,671
And as communities are force to reckon with rebuilding

109
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
Again and again

110
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Again

111
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,791
Are we going to deal with this

112
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,119
Rob Hazard is the Deputy fire marshal for Santa Barbara County

113
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,679
Anna 5th generation Santa Barbara residence

114
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,983
We are entering a new time when

115
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:07,615
Because of the weather in the impacts of climate change in long term extended drought that fires

116
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
Have reached a new level of intensity that's causing us to have to change our tactics or strategies and where

117
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,087
Stretched to the Limit all of our resources

118
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,439
13 years after my dad arrived in Montecito he and my grandmother face their first

119
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
Close call with wildfire

120
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
The Sycamore Canyon fire

121
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
It was July 26th

122
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
1977

123
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,447
Young man flew his box kite into a power line on a warm summer evening

124
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Causing a spark

125
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
Which turned into a fire

126
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,871
The Sundowner winds pushed the growing Blaze into my dad and grandmothers dense neighborhood

127
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,175
Wechat only just been built in the early 60s

128
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
They evacuated

129
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,343
We got a car full of quickly gathered mementos and the clothes on our back and

130
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
We drove out

131
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:54,207
And next morning came back in the house was gone

132
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,767
The house is burned completely

133
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
From the roof down to the foundation

134
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,863
But the foundation was fine

135
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,935
In fact the chimney was left standing in the chimney was fine

136
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,007
195 houses burned in the fire

137
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
Many of them like my dad's

138
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,847
Hargrove's made of wood shingles

139
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
Was cozy are gaps in between

140
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
Perfect for flying Embers to catch

141
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Like

142
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
Kindling on top

143
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Map of houses

144
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,391
The County Fire Marshal at the time reported watching wood shingles lift off of one burning house

145
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,487
Why do the air and land on another house with a wood shingle roof

146
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
He called it a wood roof

147
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
Conflagration

148
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,375
And was there ever any question that

149
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,679
Grandmother wanted to rebuild or

150
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,703
Was that just a given

151
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Well she had

152
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:43,103
Fire insurance and rebuilding the house was covered and

153
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
She had a

154
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
The job working for the

155
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
Schools in town and

156
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
I don't think

157
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,735
There was much question about it

158
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,159
If there is an upside to destructive wildfires it's that they give a community of the chance for a design do over

159
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:02,815
Towns have a rare opportunity to modify the landscape and rebuild houses in ways that make them more resistant

160
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
Do disasters in the future

161
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,983
Do the fifties and sixties Montecito made a handful of changes to prepare for future fires

162
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,079
The forest service tore up some of the flammable Chaparral with bulldozers

163
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
And douse it with herbicide

164
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,711
Until fears over toxic chemicals and a growing environmental movement

165
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,503
Scrap the project in the 70s

166
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:28,415
Especially firepro neighborhoods the county began requiring people to build their houses with fire-resistant roofs

167
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
And walls

168
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,767
And with wide areas of clear open space around the

169
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
What's known as defensible

170
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Space

171
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,911
Each new disaster inspires a new edit

172
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,495
When my grandmother rebuilt she changed the design of their house

173
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,311
Those nightmares wood roofs for now band

174
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
So she replace hers with concrete

175
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,663
I'm peeved over the tiny surrounding yard

176
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,991
They did what they could to make their space more defensible

177
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,831
But there can be limits to the effectiveness of defensible space

178
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,927
That's especially true in a dense Community where people have small Lots

179
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,463
We have paver sand

180
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,815
Neighbors have rights and neighbors want trees and you can only see her

181
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,119
Brush from your own land

182
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,959
So even if you're diligent about keeping your land carefully maintained

183
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,263
Your neighbor might have a propane BBQ

184
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
Are tall stand of lovely eucalyptus

185
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,151
And their house could catch your house on fire

186
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,527
In Montecito preventing fires can often prove more controversial than rebuilding after them

187
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,599
Describe fire set in managed by firefighters

188
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,671
Once considered an effective way to burn off fuel

189
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
In coastal California with its

190
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
Parts Chaparral

191
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
They're hardly done any more

192
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:43,423
The so-called controlled fires can easily grow out of control and Destroy Bible ecos

193
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
+ neighborhoods

194
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,287
In Wichita firebreaks are expensive to maintain

195
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
And ugly

196
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,455
This big stretches of cleared Lander meant to make space for fire engines hoses and hand tools

197
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,271
They provide firefighters with ready access to

198
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
The front

199
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:04,415
But residents of affluent communities don't like to see big scars across the Lush Mountainside

200
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,463
Even when it's for their own protection

201
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,791
So Rob Hazard and other County firefighters

202
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Rtasks

203
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
With a losing battle

204
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
Fighting nature and civilization

205
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
Without control over either one

206
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,823
A lot of our discussions revolve around Well Community planning that's really where we need to be tackle

207
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,407
Plan our communities better we need to build our houses were

208
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
Durable and resilient and

209
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Resistant

210
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
Combustion

211
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
We need to stop building in the in the Wildland

212
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,111
But the sad truth is that

213
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
Already

214
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
Dealt out our community

215
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
And we're only adding two

216
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,303
Adult communities grow and spread inland

217
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,375
They've gotten closer to what used to be considered wilderness

218
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,447
Now it's called the wildland-urban interface

219
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:55,615
Researchers expected a million new houses will be built in those High fire hazard areas of California in the coming day

220
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Decades

221
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
As

222
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,735
Urban populations have moved closer to the wildlands

223
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,831
We get a whole new generation of people who aren't familiar with

224
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:10,207
The risks inherent with living next to the wild lands in Southern California actually Statewide now

225
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,863
The reality is there there really isn't a Wilderness in Southern California eat anywhere in the state of California we can have a fire

226
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,215
Start in a Wilderness Area and be in the back door of a major metropolitan area

227
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
In for 5 hours

228
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,895
The same time communities are encroaching on what used to be wildlands

229
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,735
Climate change is making wildfires more frequent and intense

230
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
It's a dangerous mix

231
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,367
The Way We Live Through Fire has stayed remarkably the same

232
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
What a community Burns

233
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,975
Local authorities wash to issue new building permits

234
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,607
And the California and the grips of a housing crisis that has only intensified since the 1970s

235
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,167
It can seem crazy or not to rebuild houses

236
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,983
Even though the threat of fire is now year round

237
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,079
There is no fire season anymore

238
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,687
My grandmother died in 1999

239
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
And my dad moved into the Montecito house

240
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
In 2008

241
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
31 years after the Sycamore Canyon fire

242
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,879
The house was threatened once again

243
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,183
This fire called the T fire

244
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,535
Was eerily similar to the fire that it burn their house down all those years ago

245
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:22,143
It swooped in really fast and it took out a similar number of houses

246
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,215
It was quite nearby and very scary

247
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Like

248
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Well

249
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,735
It burned a whole bunch of houses on the next Street a block over

250
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
And

251
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,575
Smoke was swirling in

252
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
And there were Embers in the air

253
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:49,279
Should have gotten out earlier

254
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
How tall

255
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,959
The tea fire destroyed 210 homes in my dad's neighborhood

256
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,031
His house survived and despite the near-miss

257
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Again he chose to

258
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
How to say

259
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
The constant threat had made him somewhat blase

260
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,943
Like a lot of people in the community

261
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,295
When another fire sparked in the Santa Barbara Hills just six months later

262
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
The Jesus beautifier

263
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,367
He didn't worry at all

264
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,439
Sure you could see flames in the hills from his house

265
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
But they were to Canyons over

266
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,047
And everything that could burn between him in the fire

267
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Had already burned anyway

268
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,191
But just this past year something happened that made people feel a new sense of danger

269
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
First

270
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,335
It was another fire until very recently the largest in California history

271
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:40,735
In Southern California are racing against the clock

272
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
From spreading it

273
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:50,207
The Thomas fire burn through nearly a thousand homes in cities to the South before the wind moved in North Des Moines

274
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,255
Want to see dough overnight in the foothills

275
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
Residents watch The Blaze in awe

276
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
Horror

277
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,143
We have a great on the morning of December 16th

278
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
2017

279
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,751
The fire was raging five blocks away from my dad's house

280
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,823
It got so close that it 1 Point

281
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:10,175
Satellite heat map show the fire perimeter completely covering his house

282
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
It look like it was gone

283
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
And

284
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,855
I never seen all of the mountains behind

285
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,927
Burn like that if they weren't they were

286
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
Completely denuded

287
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
They look like

288
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
Desert mountains that

289
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,119
Don't have anything growing on them

290
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
A shocking thing to see

291
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
Persol

292
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
Large an area hole mountain range

293
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,967
The Thomas fire burned more than 280,000 acres and cause more than 2 billion dollars in Damages

294
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
Eventually burned into these still fresh

295
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,135
Scars from other recent fires and without Chaparral another fuel to keep it going

296
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
It simply put itself out

297
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,743
Only three houses were destroyed in Montecito

298
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
People in the town thought they'd been spared

299
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
But then the rain came

300
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,423
In the early morning of January 9th 2018

301
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,727
A storm pummeled Santa Barbara

302
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,055
Half an inch of rain fell on the mountains above Montecito

303
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
In just 5 minutes

304
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,919
ER doctor Steve Mills was up listening to the storm

305
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,991
He and his family had moved to Montecito just a few years

306
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
Before that night

307
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
Everyone went to sleep

308
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
And I couldn't

309
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,951
It was one of these things where you're in that throw half awake half asleep state

310
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
And

311
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
I heard thunder

312
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
What I thought was

313
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
NFL

314
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,143
Weird Thunder last for 30 seconds

315
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
I mean what Thunder rumbles that long

316
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,799
And then my brain finally turned on enough that I

317
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
Left out of bed

318
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
And

319
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Okay

320
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:50,271
I was going to make sure he's okay and then as I walked by I look outside and there's mud at the door

321
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
House of been enveloped in a river of mud rocks and trees there was a dead body right in front of our house there was

322
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,999
A lot of number of them washed down

323
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,047
Extreme indoor area and it was

324
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Frightening

325
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
This debris flow

326
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,423
Or what some people mistakenly call a Mudslide

327
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:12,799
Was the direct result of the Thomas fire that had burned the mountains Bear Just week before

328
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
It all goes back

329
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
The Chaparral

330
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:22,015
After the fire the waxy substance that coats the Chaparral leaves was left as a film across the score

331
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Soil

332
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,111
That oily coating made the ground impervious to water

333
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,183
Serene slipped across it instead of soaking in

334
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,743
Is the rain skimmed across the soil

335
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,791
There was no Chaparral to restrain it

336
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,607
Thomas fire had devoured all the plants

337
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,887
Years Rob hazardous

338
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
And what that does

339
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
Completely strips the

340
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,287
The hillside of anything that can hold back

341
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
Soil Rock debris

342
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,919
To such an extent that you know

343
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
Any amount of rainfall

344
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
It's going to result in some kind of

345
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,855
And then unfortunately of course we know what happened we had

346
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,415
Rainfall intensities that were 10 been seen in hundreds

347
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,047
In this landscape flood is essentially the second stage of Fire

348
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
Rain came rushing down the hills into the town

349
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
As it flowed

350
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
The water carry mud

351
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,471
Trees and rocks off the steep hills

352
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,871
Even season rescue teams are shocked by the magnitude of the destruction we don't say this I mean it is complete

353
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Devastation

354
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,199
I'm multiple multiple homes

355
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
That are completely destroyed

356
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,807
Boulders the size of small houses

357
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,367
Voted down several dense rivers of mud

358
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
More than 15 ft deep

359
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,999
Some of the debris flows reach speeds of close to 30 miles per hour

360
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,607
Boulder smashed into one house so violently that the gas man exploded

361
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
Unwhole residential blocks

362
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,215
They weren't houses to dig out under the mud

363
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
The houses were simply gone

364
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,591
Some homes were wiped off their foundations and vanished

365
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
Others turn into piles of wood in

366
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
And steel

367
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,247
My dad was fine but many of his neighbors were not

368
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,575
More than 400 homes were damaged or destroyed

369
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,367
About a tenth of the whole town

370
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,695
Hundreds of people had to be rescued by helicopter

371
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,487
23 were killed

372
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
2 or never found

373
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,167
Steve Mills and his family were lucky

374
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
By some measures

375
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,591
A few of their neighbors in their low-lying part of montecito's Flatlands ended up with Boulders in their bedroom

376
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
The Mills house is currently uninhabitable

377
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,759
And they're living in a rental while they make repairs to the property

378
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,111
They had 65 truckloads of mud and debris removed from their yard

379
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,207
Before they could even begin removing the mud and debris from under their home

380
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,815
Some of the people whose homes were destroyed have moved away and Steve's wife

381
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
Would like to do that too

382
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
She saw this

383
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
20

384
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Mud

385
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,495
Damn and it was frightening and I

386
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,615
That sort of that leaves you marked your mind just learned a great sushi

387
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,175
Really doesn't want to live here

388
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:05,343
But for now they're in a protracted battle with their insurance company and they can't fix their house until that's resolved

389
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,135
So they have to say

390
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,791
Debris flows are technically floods but since they're caused by fire

391
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,375
California law mandates that they're covered by fire insurance

392
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,679
Which everyone in Montecito has

393
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,287
The financial infrastructure that takes over when physical infrastructure fail

394
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
More than government

395
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,919
It's insurance companies that seem to make the decisions about where and how

396
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,711
People can live in California

397
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:36,319
Insurance companies complain that their subsidizing for risky decisions

398
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
But for the most part

399
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
They don't stop and train people

400
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
They just increase prices

401
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,231
In California and even more

402
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Exclusive

403
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
The place to live for everyone

404
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
The housing market is cold

405
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Somewhat

406
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,167
Montecito is a whole remains desirable

407
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,055
If anything the value of every property that wasn't destroyed by fire or flood in the last year

408
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
I've only gone up

409
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,919
With the Chaparral bird out of the hills the whole wrist

410
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,967
Paradigm in Montecito has changed

411
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
As have the engineering challenges

412
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,087
Threat of fire is another 20 years off

413
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:14,463
The immediate concern now is when the next rain might come and bury the town in mud again

414
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:19,583
I mean to have that amount of intensity that follows up a fire that have

415
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,727
Select off the hillside you know that that's not going to happen very often does it doesn't mean it's not going to happen again

416
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Of course not

417
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,823
More debris flows are inevitable in Montecito

418
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,431
They're how the whole area was formed hundreds of thousands of years ago

419
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,015
They're what carved those lovely canyons and created those pic

420
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
Tres creeks

421
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:46,207
Homeowners here have been landscaping around the boulders in their yards for decades without realizing how they got

422
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,743
Got there and what they meant

423
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,583
Now geologist are studying the area with new urgency

424
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,471
They found huge Earth shifting debris flows as old as 125000 years

425
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
And as young as a thousand years

426
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,639
This wasn't the first time a debris flow had flooded Montecito with a wall of mud and rocks

427
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,199
It's a regular repeating cycle

428
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,271
It's somehow everyone still manages to forget

429
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
In our area

430
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
We are very used to how to deal with

431
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
People know how to deal with

432
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,000
But it lulls them into a certain amount of

433
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
Complacency in it

434
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,072
How to deal with other emergencies

435
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,168
Dustin Williams is the elected County Supervisor who represents Montecito

436
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,216
As an unincorporated community

437
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,544
Montecito doesn't have its own political decision-making by

438
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,592
And it likes it that way

439
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,176
The town is voted on in corporation before and it's never passed

440
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,760
There's a classic California libertarian streak here

441
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,112
Which values private property rights alongside tight local community control and C

442
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
Support

443
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
So far

444
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,000
Santa Barbara County has made it pretty easy for the residents of Montecito to rebuild

445
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:57,376
They've developed a streamline review process and are mostly letting homeowners rebuild as they choose

446
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,192
Does Williams is just hoping they'll choose well

447
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
Moments like this

448
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,520
Do provide an opportunity for

449
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
Are people too

450
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,848
Soul searching, maybe it's

451
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
Better

452
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,920
If I either see if I can

453
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
Build outside of that

454
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
Envelope

455
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
Which is why we have

456
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,344
Provided more flexibility on rebuilding

457
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,160
Or make the individual decision to not read

458
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,304
I know everyone has to build with two threats in mind

459
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
Fire & Flood

460
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,424
You can clear brush from yards install fire-resistant

461
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,728
Exciting build concrete roofs in

462
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,312
Even by systems that will shoot flame retardant goo all over your house

463
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,920
You can close the crawl spaces above your foundation and lift your house up on pilings

464
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:46,784
But you can't make a home in pervious to a boulder smashing into it at 30 miles an hour

465
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,880
American Institute of Architects is Wayne in with design recommendation

466
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:57,024
Pants and FEMA updated its flood risk maps from 2012 to better account for the hazards that follow a fire

467
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
The best accounting can do

468
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,888
Is require people to rebuild Within These new guideline

469
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,240
Which golfer houses in the newly-expanded floodplain to be raised up

470
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,544
On elevated foundations or pilings

471
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,592
We made the decision

472
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,920
We're not going to tell people that they can't rebuild

473
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,712
As long as they comply with

474
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,040
FEMA recovery maps in the elevations

475
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
Map

476
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
But

477
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,440
That does not mean that rebuilding is a good idea and I'll

478
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,560
Gus Williams would actually like to see certain flood-prone neighborhoods

479
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
Stay empty

480
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
For the greater good

481
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,192
Annies considering Boulder steps local government could take

482
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,592
Eminent domain would empower the county to take people's homes and land in service of Public Safety

483
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,640
If the county could come up with the money

484
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,456
Well the majority of land out there

485
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
And this is a bit constrained on our ability

486
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
Improve the situation

487
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
Is in private hands

488
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,392
And it's in private hands with pretty high

489
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Property

490
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
Which makes it very hard for government

491
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
Acquire land

492
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
2

493
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,584
Massively

494
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Changed it

495
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
Equation

496
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,240
A single lot of land in Montecito can cause more than $1000000

497
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,056
And Das Williams would like to buy a lot of it

498
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,848
With the help of local philanthropy

499
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:19,456
Parcels near creeks would be kept vacant as Memorial Park land

500
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,992
And would act as a buffer

501
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,576
Creating more space between future debris flows and home

502
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,928
There are other bigger infrastructure projects that the government could try

503
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,488
They just aren't available to individual homeowners

504
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,840
Metal Nets could be installed on hillsides before a large storms

505
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,144
Dacatch chunks of the mountain before they reached

506
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
The town

507
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,240
And the 11 existing debris basins in the mountains

508
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:46,848
What's your kind of like dams designed to catch large rocks and trees flooding down the hill

509
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,896
To be expanded and modernized

510
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,992
Das Williams is working to raise money for those new bigger basin

511
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,064
The same people who don't like the look of firebreak

512
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,672
Seemed unlikely to embrace Stark concrete dams and oversized

513
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,232
Steel Nutz morning there beautiful Hillside

514
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,536
Venus williams has his way

515
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,840
They may no longer have a choice

516
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,728
My dad wasn't affected by the January floods

517
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:17,568
But his house sits right in the middle of historic debris flow

518
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:22,944
There's a creek at the bottom of his steep driveway and The Tell-Tale Boulders line has neighbors yards

519
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,272
I showed him the FEMA map that puts him in the red zone

520
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
He hasn't seen it yet

521
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,904
It bothers me to look at this map and see if the

522
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,464
Red area pointing into a creek

523
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:39,328
But for my dad the map appears to exist separate from his look reality

524
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,168
So far the house is made it through every disaster but one

525
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
By his account

526
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,472
Those are pretty good

527
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,752
Any other evidence

528
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
It's just isn't persuasive

529
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,080
It needs to burn down

530
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
Twice for me to get a

531
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,712
A sense of how often it burns down I mean

532
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,784
Turning down once I don't have enough data points

533
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,368
My dad's math themes

534
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Dubious

535
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:09,280
But part of his personal threat appraisal seems to be an assumption that disaster build character

536
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,632
My dad likes to say he has a healthy relationship with the stuff he owns

537
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,192
Because he's experienced losing it all before

538
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
Plus he says

539
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,264
With climate change

540
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
Isn't every place

541
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
Disaster-prone

542
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,640
Why not at least stick with the horror he knows

543
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
It's app

544
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
Play Sia

545
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
Love

546
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:32,064
Comforting and familiar and and

547
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
You know I could move

548
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,928
Somewhere else in California and have an earthquake

549
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,512
Move somewhere else and have a

550
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,864
A hurricane take out all of all of middle of Florida I could move

551
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,400
TCU student death

552
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:52,032
Floods destroy the whole city did move to New Orleans have floods destroy the whole city

553
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
You know every place has their issue I've got the issue of a house that burns down once

554
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:04,064
Every 57 years

555
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,424
It's true that anywhere you go there are risks

556
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,824
Even halfway around the world we have a story about how Coastal communities in Japan Warren future Generations

557
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,872
About the risk of tsunamis

558
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
After that

559
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:41,696
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered World a man-made sound

560
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,584
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

561
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,472
Just talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remedy for all hearing that voice

562
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,264
Technology talk to us

563
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,568
It is a creation of Sonic trash

564
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,384
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

565
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,968
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

566
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
To make them more human

567
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
Turn the living room lights on

568
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
Okay

569
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,208
Dim the living room lights to 50%

570
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
Okay

571
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:22,656
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

572
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,472
Makes for a much more natural experience

573
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
Turn the living room lights on

574
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,104
Dim the living room lights to 50

575
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
2%

576
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:39,040
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

578
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,416
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

We need to talk about something constipation abdominal pain and bloating

583
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:02,848
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

584
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:08,480
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

585
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760

Has Daryl Cagle noted at the end of that story there are risks associated with living anywhere

591
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:33,312
But there are places like Montecito where there is a persistent threat

592
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
It is important not

593
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
Colette the memory of

594
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Disasters

595
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,432
Fade away so much that

596
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
People make poor choices in the present

597
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,320
Triclosan is here to talk about how people in Japan sent warning

598
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
Future Generations

599
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,648
About the dangers of tsunamis

600
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
There's this

601
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,208
Huge Old Stone

602
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,768
Sitting on a hillside blue honey Oshi Japan

603
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,816
And there's a warning card

604
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,144
Intuit which locals credit with repeatedly saving their clothes

605
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
Translated it reads

606
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,776
Do not build any homes below this point

607
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,568
High dwellings are the peace

608
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,104
In harmony of our descendants

609
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,920
Remember the Calamity of the great tsunami

610
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,480
So what happened that made

611
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
Their ancestor

612
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
Decide they need to put up

613
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,624
Well it started way back in the 1890s

614
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
Earthquake off the coast

615
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,976
Followed by a pair of really devastating tsunamis

616
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,536
Huge wave throws up over a hundred

617
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,096
And destroyed thousands of coastal homes

618
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
In the aftermath

619
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,424
Locals in on EOS Rebel

620
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,240
Then they got hit again in the 1930s

621
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:38,080
So that point they decided we got to move to town uphill

622
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
And they left behind this morning

623
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:46,016
So when big tsunami struck in 1960 and then again in 2011 the village set

624
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,296
Safely above the high-water mark

625
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,880
Assassin Amazing Story

626
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,208
Right there hundreds of these along the coast

627
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,024
Some of which date back over 500 years

628
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,816
Lincoln me really big 2

629
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
Summer is tallest 10 ft

630
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,168
Are they all really telling you where or we're not

631
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,192
The Builder they all like

632
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,240
About zoning regulations

633
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:12,640
Well not all of them some of them are more like memorials to pass disasters

634
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
Victims

635
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,760
Others just off of these blanket warnings to head for Higher Ground during earthquake

636
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
Escape the waves

637
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,112
And their cases to of towns ignoring worth

638
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
Specific warnings

639
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
The shore

640
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,488
Been facing serious destruction in a later tsunami

641
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,584
So do people still pay attention to these stones are they base

642
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Historical map

643
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
As a prank

644
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
Good morning they're pretty outdated

645
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:41,056
You still in still get put up sometimes but more is Memorials than

646
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
Warnings

647
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,408
These days Japan has a lot of high-tech warning system

648
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
Really well marked evacuation

649
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,784
They also engineer better houses and put up seawalls protect

650
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,112
Oh as we saw in 2011

651
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,392
Those aren't always enough

652
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,208

Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

694
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,312
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

Might cost you your life

699
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:01,088
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

700
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:05,184
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

701
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,768
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

702
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
A dad

703
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,144
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

704
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,496
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

705
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
Nothing

706
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:25,920
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

707
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,248
Was found dead in my private gym

708

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

709
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:36,928
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

710
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,256
Now I need to clear my name

711
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:45,632
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

712
