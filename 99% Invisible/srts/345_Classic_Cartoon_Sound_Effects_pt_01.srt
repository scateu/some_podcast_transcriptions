00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:35,232
The podcast twenty thousand Hertz tell stories about the world's most recognizable and interesting sounds

35
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,768
It is a great show

36
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
You should definitely subscribe to

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,120
Please represent one of their episodes here today

38
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
It's all about these sounds

39
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:49,568
Which almost need no introduction

40
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
Twenty thousand Hertz

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
Here is Dallas Taylor

42
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:01,344
If you watch cartoons as a kid you probably knew instantly that the sound you just heard was from Looney Tunes

43
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:06,464
You probably also know that sound Matt Wile E coyote failed to catch the roadrunner

44
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
Again

45
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,352
3 crazy how we can fill in the whole scene based solely on the sound effects

46
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,424
Even without a single meat meat from the roadrunner

47
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,056
Wylie Coyote started falling off cliffs in 1949

48
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,128
Yet we still hear that falling sound effect in modern cartoon

49
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
Shows Like Teen Titans

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
I wouldn't stand there about

51
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
Here it is in Justice League action

52
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,232
How do you do that

53
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,888
And here it is even in Family Guy

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,664
It's been almost 70 years since the first Wylie Coyote cartoon

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,760
And that sound along with many other cartoon sounds remains constant

56
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
The Beauty and the joy of cartoon animation is that the characters do not have to obey the laws

57
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Isaac physics

58
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,424
They also don't have to obey the laws of logic

59
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
And therefore

60
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,544
Sound doesn't have to obey those laws either

61
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
That's Mark Mangini

62
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,408
An oscar-winning sound designer who works with the Formosa group

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,760
I don't very often get to talk about my early days and cartoons

64
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
Mark doesn't get a lot of questions about cartoons

65
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,416
Because he has an impressive resume designing sound for Hollywood blockbusters

66
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,792
I've worked on a hundred and forty-two live-action films

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
Most recently bladerunner2049

68
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
Mad Max

69
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
Fury Road Wiki

70
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,240
I want an Oscar for and I'm very proud of

71
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
Warrior

72
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
Kremlin

73
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
4 Star Trek

74
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
A die-hard Lethal Weapon

75
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
Green Mile

76
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:12,672
But before Market sound for films he worked for one of the most famous cartoon studios in the world

77
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:18,559
My first job in sound was at Hanna-Barbera studios in their Sound Apartments

78
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,631
I started as a track reader

79
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,983
Which is a subset of sound editing where

80
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
You're charged with

81
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
Transcribing

82
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
The recordings of the voices

83
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,455
So did the animators know when to open and close the mouth so the characters

84
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:43,903
That led to subsequent promotions to becoming a sound effects editor

85
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,463
In that department to Hanna Barbera

86
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,839
And an apprenticeship with a number of really amazingly gifted sound editors

87
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,655
Back then this was 1976

88
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
I didn't know anyone

89
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,007
Who is called a sound designer

90
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:04,383
But I would argue that everything that we were doing it Hanna-Barbera was every bit as

91
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Designed

92
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
As Maybe

93
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,295
Something more profound that was being heard in a motion picture

94
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,135
Mark works on some of hanna-barbera's most famous cartoon

95
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,463
The Flintstones

96
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
Some Huckleberry Hound

97
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
A whole raft

98
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Scooby-Doo's

99
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,079
Where are you

100
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Super Friends

101
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
Their mission

102
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
To fight Injustice

103
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:45,087
To right that which is wrong and Reserve all mankind

104
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,183
And my personal favorite because it starred Mel Blanc

105
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,583
Captain Caveman

106
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
Long before Mark works for Hanna Barbera

107
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,079
And even before Wylie Coyote was falling off cliffs

108
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,175
Walt Disney made history with Steamboat Willie in 1928

109
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,111
This was the first cartoon with synchronized picture and sound

110
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
Walt

111
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,047
Android ndk Eyeworks themselves

112
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:31,935
Would be the sound effects guys in their live orchestral recording sessions for those early Steamboat Willies

113
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,287
In the early days before there was multi-track recording or mix

114
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:42,175
Thank you had to perform the sound effects live with your costura in one straight path

115
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,479
Saudi sound effect guys

116
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,319
How to assemble prop put them in front of microphones and

117
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,719
Perform anything that they put acoustically live and in sync with the orchestra

118
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,351
Music and sound effects had to be performed at the same time in the same space

119
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,935
Musical instruments were used to make the effects because they were easy to find

120
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
An easy to manipulate

121
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:10,847
Tom and Jerry clip the sound of a frying pan hitting X face and played by a simple crash

122
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,503
Falling whistle from the beginning of the episode

123
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
Displayed on a slide whistle

124
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,623
The percussionist would probably have it as part of their kit

125
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
And it was just a natural to convey

126
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
Going up

127
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Or down

128
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:37,215
You could manipulate them in any one of a number of ways for quickly or very slowly

129
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Sound effects

130
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,639
Play buy musical instruments became an iconic part of all cartoons

131
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,759
Then new technology in the 1930s allowed sound editors to add sound effects

132
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
After recording the orchestra

133
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,599
They could use any prop to make a sound

134
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,903
But often still shows musical instrument

135
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
Because sound effects and music were tightly linked

136
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
They work together to create unique soundscapes

137
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:05,887
Listen to this audio clip from the very first Bugs Bunny cartoon called Porky's Hare hunt

138
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,471
You can get an idea of how effects and music can come together

139
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:28,159
The sounds for Porky's Hare hunt were created by an editor named treg Brown

140
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
Treadworks on Looney Tunes for decades

141
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,303
Created many of the iconic cartoon sounds we still know today

142
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,239
Once we divorce ourselves from the need to record live to picture

143
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
Craighead the

144
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
Fundamental understanding of

145
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,919
How to decontextualized the sound how to take the sound

146
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
Your finger in a coke bottle

147
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
And make that the sound of the Roadrunner tongue flip

148
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,951
Why the sound of an inertia starter the sound

149
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,047
Of this motor that makes a biplane engine start

150
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,119
Why that's the sound of a spinning Tasmanian devil

151
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
He learned

152
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,527
A genius at

153
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
Taking sound out of one contest

154
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
Placing them in another

155
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,695
And that's what made him so amazing and when you listen to

156
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Does

157
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
Looney Tunes shorts

158
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
There isn't a lot of

159
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
Cartoons

160
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
Is there is not a lot of

161
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
Comedic sound

162
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
It's all blood in his ability to

163
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,495
Take the sound from somewhere else

164
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
And put it where it didn't belong

165
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,127
Creating this bizarre juxtaposition that made it funny

166
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
Has anybody

167
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
Better than he was at that

168
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
Around the same time Shrek was working at Warner Brothers

169
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,671
William Hanna and Joseph Barbera we're creating the Tom and Jerry cartoons at MGM

170
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Marc's mentor

171
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Greg Watson

172
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,535
What's the sound editor on those early Tom and Jerry cartoons

173
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
When I met him is he was in a 6

174
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:17,471
Late in his career but immensely proud to be still working in cartoon and he still

175
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
So I deserve an art form

176
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,799
Something is very proud of

177
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,359
He would never take credit

178
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,663
For anything unless I asked him

179
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,759
Greg where did this come from and he said oh I remember back in

180
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
You know

181
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
51 1

182
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:38,975
Bill did this one funny scene with Jerry and we needed a funny sound and we thought it would be good to do

183
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
Do this

184
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
He was a man that was

185
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,839
Thrilled to be a part of the process

186
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:54,079
Bill Hanna and Joseph Barbera eventually created their own studio and during their 30 years of making cartoons they free

187
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
Created a massive library of

188
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Totally classic

189
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Sex sounds

190
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
I think they're unique

191
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
At least because

192
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
Of their own Merit

193
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
They're just

194
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Silly

195
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
So many of them

196
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
Even out of the context of the cartoon

197
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,231
Just sound like that's just the silliest thing I've ever heard

198
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,119
But then within the context of the cartoons in the way that they were used in the life that they brought

199
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
To those cartoons

200
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
They just get better

201
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,007
Basking in the Limelight of the animation

202
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
The sound is pretty silly on its own

203
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:34,015
Now imagine Tom hanging from his whiskers in the unavoidable fall as each one is plucked from his cheeks

204
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,791
There were hundreds of familiar sounds like this created at Hanna-Barbera Studios

205
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,863
They had such a signature quality to themselves

206
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,423
It made them stand out as a unique piece of

207
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
Quality artwork

208
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Sonic artwork

209
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
In the 1960

210
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,847
Hanna-Barbera started selling their Sound Library

211
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,687
Other production companies like Warner Brothers use these sounds to this day

212
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:08,831
The popularity of the Hanna-Barbera Sound Library has given cartoons and almost Universal sound language

213
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,391
But Mark feels some sounds are overused

214
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,743
I was on a one-man campaign to eradicate

215
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
Head take

216
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
It was this

217
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:23,423
Name noise that was again I think a recording accident

218
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,495
That you use whatever a character

219
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,311
Allison caught themselves in the midst of

220
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,127
Thinking or experiencing something bizarre

221
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,919
And it was way overused

222
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,759
And did you ever notice how it sounds when a cartoon character runs

223
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
Mark's not a fan of that one either

224
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
That running sound was called blob

225
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Gallup

226
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
And again a sound that

227
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:52,351
Was I felt overusing I I tried to not use it

228
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:57,727
As often as I could it's a logical but I tried not to use it as often as possible

229
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
It's a testament to its effectiveness

230
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,847
Even in 1976 I was

231
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,895
Turning into an elitist I suppose

232
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
Embarrassing

233
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,015
Of course there are plenty of sounds that Mark loves

234
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
Like tiptoeing xylophone

235
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
Oh that's

236
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,999
Classic sound I have actually used

237
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
That sound

238
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:26,911
I did the two Flintstone live-action movies and I did use it in that because

239
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,751
That was a sound that Brian Levant the director and I just loved

240
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,567
We just couldn't avoid using that

241
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,711
My favorite was The Jetsons spaceship

242
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:51,231
And I never found out what those were made from a tried to deconstruct them

243
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:55,583
I asked around the studio if they know who made them and nobody knew

244
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,655
But that sound always brings a smile to my face

245
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
Some of these old techniques have been lost

246
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,759
But remember this was a busy Studio

247
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,855
And everyone was focused on getting the work done on time and getting cartoons on air

248
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,207
It was real machine it always started with track reading

249
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
This is ballpoint

250
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
Pun

251
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Line 1

252
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
Good evening ladies and gentlemen

253
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Which is to say

254
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:34,751
The voices would be assembled in a studio with a script and storyboard

255
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,311
The director of that show would walk

256
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:41,407
The talent through the recording session so that you captured all the voices

257
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,015
Speaking all the lines that you needed for that particular episode

258
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
Watch Supernanny

259
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Okay

260
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,231
Then the animators would go off and then draw the characters doing these things

261
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:00,863
And a month later all the animation would come back and short rolls of completed theme

262
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:05,471
Then we in the editorial Department assemble them in their storyboard order

263
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
And then cut them down to sheol

264
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,359
Anomatic in between like we have in live action

265
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
Weed assemble a show

266
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
And then cuts down to it

267
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:23,135
When Mark was working with Hanna-Barbera they didn't have a department dedicated to creating new sounds

268
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,975
If you wanted an effect that wasn't in the library. To find himself

269
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
You would just

270
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
Kind of on your own

271
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,607
I was the most Adventures especially for

272
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,423
Super Friends I would go across the hall

273
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,263
Talk to the two composers of Paul to court and Hoyt Curtin

274
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,383
And ask them for musical sounds and especially synthesizer sound so they would give me

275
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Long

276
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
Recording

277
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
Stretches are good

278
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
Weird noises they make with their synthesizers

279
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,063
And they would always be used as

280
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
Science fiction components if I had a

281
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
Beijing Opera

282
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,183
Flying Saucer in an episode

283
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,255
That's what I use the electronic sounds for because that felt

284
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
Futuristic

285
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,935
Efmark couldn't find the sound he wanted

286
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
Create it

287
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,007
Even if he had to use his own voice

288
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,407
If you can't find it you do it with your voice it's the easiest tool to manipulate you have total control over it

289
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,783
I use it for creatures and animals and funny noises

290
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,367
I did a lot of Gremlins voices for the Gremlins movies

291
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,399
It's just something where you feel the character inside of yourself and you think

292
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
I can do this better

293
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
And you just do it

294
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,079
Mark also went on to work on some of the most classic animated films

295
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Baidu Beauty and the Beast

296
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Aladdin

297
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
I can show you the world

298
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
And The Lion King

299
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,031
March experiences with animated films were different from the grind of televised cartoons

300
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
If nothing else

301
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,871
You get much better

302
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Schedules

303
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,687
We usually get

304
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,991
The time to design

305
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,831
And create something that no one's ever heard before

306
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,391
Another sort of unique distinction is that

307
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
You have the option

308
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
To create sound

309
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
First

310
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,583
And then have animation be done to what you did

311
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,679
It's not that often that we get to actually drive the in

312
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
And on the

313
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:49,311
Disney animated films in the Pixar films in the DreamWorks films and others

314
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:55,199
They're smart enough to know the value of sound and how it can be the inspiration to the artist

315
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,783
To draw something they might not otherwise have drawn

316
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,087
For example in Beauty and the Beast

317
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,647
Belle's dad was this inventor Aeneid built that

318
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
Funny Acts

319
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
Chopping machine

320
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,279
That was a sound that we made before animation

321
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,335
The song

322
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,503
That's just pure design that's when you get to let your imagination run while you can see a picture

323
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
Storyboard and then

324
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
You just get to dream up what it might sound like and that's just gold for sound designer when you should've allowed to do

325
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
Design unfettered

326
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:51,519
With all the cable channels in streaming services available today there's more animation than ever before

327
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
How does sound design work

328
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,967
In modern cartoons in which iconic sounds are still used today we'll get to all of that when 20,000

329
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,527
Hertz on 99percentinvisible continues

330
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,951
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

331
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,511
The cluttered World a man-made sound

332
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,143
If I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

333
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:23,519
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another room and we're all hearing.

334
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,823
Voice technology talk to us

335
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,127
It is a creation of Sonic trash

336
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,943
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

337
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,527
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

338
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
To make them more human

339
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
Turn the living room lights on

340
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Okay

341
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Dim the living room lights

342
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
50%

343
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
Okay

344
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,655
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake

345
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,215
Human and adding in some thoughtful sound

346
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,031
Makes for a much more natural experience

347
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,079
Turn the living room lights on

348
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,663
Dim the living room lights to 50

349
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
80%

350
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,879
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

351
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,671
Is impacting our health

352
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,975
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

353
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,047
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

354
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
Right here

355
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
NPR

356
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,519
If you haven't watched a cartoon in years

357
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,615
It might surprise you that sounds from decades ago are still being used today

358
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
I use the older side effects

359
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:43,647
Hanna-Barbera library of the Warner Brothers Library

360
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
That's Heather Olsen

361
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,231
Emmy-nominated sound designer for animation

362

Fairly Odd Parents

Gravity Falls for Disney XD

372
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
Rest assured

373
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,992
There's a perfectly logical explanation

374
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,040
And The Boondocks for Sony

375
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,232
Heather is an expert in modern cartoon sound design

376
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:57,888
Cartoon sound effects are different from live-action sound effects because would live action you start with production sad you record

377
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:02,240
Burning a picture in the recording the audio at the same time

378
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
Street you have cars going by

379
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:09,920
Was it a cartoon if you were doing a street seeing all I get is dialog it's just the actors were recorded

380
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:16,320
Get to start with a blank slate I don't have to try to hide production backgrounds I get to get the dialogue and I get to create a word

381
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
Roll around it

382
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,696
Call the best thing and the worst thing at the same time to work in a cartoon because

383
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:27,328
You're not trying to hide anything but you have nothing to start with so in your head you have to think what was the sound like

384
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:34,496
Much like marks time at Hanna-Barbera Heather gets a fully animated show and often add sound effects from a ready-made Library

385
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Sound

386
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,592
This includes many from the Hanna-Barbera and Warner Brothers Library

387
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Dear are some of her favorites

388
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,456
Call the tooth sunk sound effects

389
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,784
Everybody knows how this sounds like it's called but is that

390
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,856
Get your head stuck in a jar

391
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,256
So clearly conveys my head is stuck in his jar it's not coming out again

392
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,816
Elsa

393
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,680
I'm using the phone all the time

394
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:11,616
I think I'm just persisted in everybody is because I said language that we've started to understand

395
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,944
Blake's you kind of expect to hear that

396
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,784
And of course Heather uses the falling whistle

397
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,696
I think in our side effects Library it's called bomb drop but it's the same thing

398
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
That's another piece of the language that everybody knows

399
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,376
And some of the show she works on or more realistic

400
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,984
Heather wants us to hear the sounds of the characters moving around interacting with their world

401
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
Kind of like a live-action movie

402
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
The Foley Department

403
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,872
Really brings the shuttle life they record

404
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
Things characters

405
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Call props

406
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,904
They do more of the smaller sounds and it's great to have fully doing that still alive because then you're not hearing the same

407
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,720
Footsteps over and over they really make it sound more real

408
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
And just like in the past

409
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,888
If you can't find a sound you have to make it

410
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:12,288
Stranger things I've actually recorded it done myself for a sound effect is we had a bit in robot and monster with everyone

411
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:17,152
I was in a crowded restaurant so it's supposed to be this crowd of people gagging and grossed out by something

412
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,224
My library

413
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,272
So I grabbed a bunch of people around the office

414
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,344
And we recorded ourselves gagging and lots of different ways

415
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,520
Sometimes layering multiple sounds together is the best way to create something new

416
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,360
Combination that you might expect

417
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:53,760
Animals in engines is a really great one animal Roars under engines growls it really kind of brings

418
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
Vehicle to life

419
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,576
A lot of shows do it

420
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:00,416
Star Wars the Tie fighters are some growls under there as they go by

421
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
Actually love

422
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
It's fantastic

423
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
Inspiration

424
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,240
Another option Heather has is to take a classic Library sound and change its pitch to make a new effect

425
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,288
Take this cartoon boing sound effect

426
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
She can pitch that sound up

427
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Or down

428
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
Other uses a lot

429
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,760
Classic non-literal sounds while working on car

430
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Cartoons

431
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,856
But some Modern cartoons are more realistic than slapstick

432
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,160
Our choices really depend on the show

433
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:37,536
Should I get a new show the show the clients come in

434
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
Get together

435
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:45,472
Talk about the overall feel of the show I cuz it going to be kind of a realistic show

436
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,544
Fairly OddParents

437
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,688
Fairly Odd Parents taught me how to speak cartoon

438
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,736
Nothing without the appropriate protective gear

439
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,320
It's just nonstop cartoon cartoon cartoon

440
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:04,416
Where's the Bulldog Spirit it feels more like you're making a movie with horses

441
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,464
Outlook Fields with girls

442
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
What's my boy

443
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,280
Remember me from the Train

444
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:18,240
Because Spirit riding free has more natural sounds than a cartoon like Fairly Odd Parents

445
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,032
Heather needed some new sounds

446
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,152
We got a whole new horse library because in that show there's three characters who are horses

447
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,552
And each of the different personalities we had to find kind of different vocals for each of the horses

448
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:40,768
But even Spirit riding free still sometimes needs a dose of the vintage cartoon sounds

449
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:50,496
A lot of times people will come in with their show and say I don't want to use his old Hanna-Barbera sounds I want to do something completely different

450
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:55,104
But they kind of animated the traditional way so when you put new sounds today

451
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,712
Feels wrong and a lot of times go back to using the older sound effects

452
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,648
When it comes to cartoon sound design

453
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,232
Mark and Heather both agree that the medium pushes the boundaries

454
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Creativity

455
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
Characters

456
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,096
Stretch a naturally

457
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Out of their body shape

458
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,008
Those are just the simplest examples of visually what's happening with these characters so

459
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
In a way

460
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,056
It gives you

461
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,336
Permission

462
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,128
Break the laws of

463
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,688
What sound you should hear when you see something

464
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:35,808
Working for animation cuz I'd like to build the world with sound from the ground up

465
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:41,184
The best part is you're designing a world from the world that no one's ever heard before

466
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,304
Sound design for the process for animation cuz there's no

467
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,864
Talking so you get to do the backgrounds and

468
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
So now

469
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,336
There's so many tools that anyone can get their hands on

470
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,896
You're really free to design sound

471
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,200
In any way your imagination

472
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Desire

473
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,784
Important for us to

474
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,320
Follow our hearts

475
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
When we follow our hearts

476
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:14,464
And then we make a career out of that we make a day-to-day avocation to something

477
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
That gives all of us purpose

478
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,584
And it allows us to make a contribution to the world

479
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:41,088

A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

Comic mystery

Might cost you your life

510
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:17,600
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

511
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,952
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

512
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,536
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

513
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
A dad

514
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,656

I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

518

A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

519
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,016
Was found dead in my private gym

520
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:49,344
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

521
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,696
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

522
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Now

523
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,768
I need to clear my name

524
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,120

525
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,168
