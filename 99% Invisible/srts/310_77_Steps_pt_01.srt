This is 99% invisible

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,240
In the early 1940s has the war effort ramped-up

25
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,032
And maybe put out a proposal

26
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,360
Chairs they needed a chair that was Fireproof

27
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,128
Waterproof

28
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,688
Lightweight and strong enough to survive

29
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,968
Torpedo blast

30
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:29,344
An engineer named Wilton C dentist designed a chair he knew would be perfect

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,392
A chair made out of aluminum

32
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,488
Wilton Dinges developed a method of process

33
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
To take this aluminum

34
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
And bend it

35
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,864
Weld it and grind it and he treated

36
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,960
All of these elements are all invisible but

37
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,776
Part of making something

38
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
This super strong

39
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
That's Greg buchbinder

40
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,152
He knows this chair inside and out

41
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,968
It's the the most indestructible chair on the planet

42
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
Wouldn't they just proved Us by taking his super strong indestructible aluminum chair up to the 8th floor of the Excelsior Hotel

43
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,952
Hotel in Chicago where the Navy was holding chair auditions

44
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
He Pruitt

45
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
Out the window

46
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,328
And hit the sidewalk and found several times

47
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,632
Retroactively terrified by this post right

48
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,448
Someone ran the chair back up and it was it was

49
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
Completely perfect

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Undamaged

51
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,616
The Navy was impressed and they gave Wilton dingess a huge contract

52
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,712
In order to fill this contract he opened a huge Factory

53
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,064
He called his business the electrical machine and Equipment Company

54
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
Amica

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,648
That's my fellow radiotopia and Benjamin Walker

56
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
Host of The Theory of Everything

57
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
Benjamin reported this story

58
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,280
Over the next few decades

59
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Amoco ship

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
Hundreds of thousands of these

61
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
He's 1006 Navy chair

62
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,656
The US government

63
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
Factory

64
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
Hanover Pennsylvania

65
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
It became

66
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
Standard issue for all worship

67
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
Battleships aircraft carriers

68
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Submarine

69
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
It's aluminum

70
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Silver

71
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
Modern and minimal not too many floors

72
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
It doesn't even have arms

73
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
Just three slats

74
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
Coming down from the back

75
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
The top is art

76
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
But it's squared off a bit on the side

77
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,232
It's a utilitarian looking design

78
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,560
Except it has one slightly unexpected enhancement

79
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
There's a divot

80
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
Receipt for your butt

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
In the 1970s

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,032
Amica was purchased by a California businessman named Jay bookbinder

83
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
That's great father

84
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,360
But by the 1990s

85
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,664
The company was losing a lot of money

86
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
So Greg took a trip to the factory

87
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
To check on

88
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,064
When he got there things look really bleak

89
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
Primerica

90
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
It was

91
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,904
Skeleton Crew

92
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,768
The guys were we're just waiting for the company to close

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
The government contracts

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
How long dried up

95
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
Greg started to think

96
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,680
Perhaps this place should be shut down

97
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
But then

98
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
He overheard a phone call

99
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
Between the office manager Paulina

100
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
And a mystery customer

101
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:03,456
She was on the phone you just know we will not ship your chairs you should you send this money first

102
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
Slam the phone down and X

103
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,576
Alina who is that she sold some guy Georgia

104
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Anime

105
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
She had no idea who that was

106
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,024
And I started look through the file cameras of who we were shipping chairs to

107
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,143
They were shipping chairs to designers like Giorgio Armani and Terence conran

108
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,959
It's tip entrepreneurs like Ian Schrager

109
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
Wealthy tastemaker

110
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
I discovered the beauty

111
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,591
Indestructible Navy Surplus chairs

112
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
Brake suddenly realize

113
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,991
The emeco could sell to what was mostly an untapped Market

114
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
I just felt right at the time

115
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,111
If we can shift our Focus from government sales

116
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
2

117
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
Focus on Architects and designers

118
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,255
That would be an opportunity for us

119
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
To take this thing

120
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
And turn it around

121
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,887
Greg buchbinder definitely turn things around

122
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,727
Today emeco makes new chairs with Architects and designers like Norman Foster

123
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
Frank gehry and Philippe Starck

124
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,895
And the original 1006 Navy chair has become one of the most iconic chairs in the world

125
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
You've definitely seen it before

126
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,319
All kinds of movies and TV shows that can be seen in The Matrix and Avatar

127
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:16,927
Upholstered version shows up in the dark knight when Batman interrogates the Joker

128
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,559
It's the chair museum team set in prison

129
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
And police station

130
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,447
It's also a go-to chair for fancy restaurants and art galleries and co-working spaces

131
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
It's everywhere

132
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
But not all of these chairs

133
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
Are emeco chairs

134
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
A lot of them are knock off

135
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Sex

136
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,551
How can you tell if they're real curves see the bottom slot

137
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:48,927
Last month Benjamin walking around New York City showing me both real and fake in Macau chairs

138
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,279
Like the fancy Diner filled with wheel emeco chairs near his apartment in the East Village

139
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,351
Nice chairs in wood

140
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,143
Full of people

141
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,191
They look wealthy

142
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
Then Benjamin took me to his place

143
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:08,639
Show me his collection of real and fake Emma coats

144
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
First knock off

145
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,063
That's kind of excited about if you lift it up you'll see that there's something immediately wrong

146
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,767
Benjamin Walker is obsessed with the real and the fake

147
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,327
What makes something real and when does it matter

148
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,167
These are questions he's exploring right now in a mini-series on his show

149
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
The Theory of Everything

150
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,311
And for 99percentinvisible I wanted to look at the real and the fake

151
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,919
As they relate to the design of chairs

152
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
In America today

153
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:50,879
Most people think of design and shape the average consumer doesn't realize the design is so much more than

154
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
To understand what a real Amoco is

155
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
You need to understand

156
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
Not just what it looks like

157
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
How It's Made

158
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,655
There's 77 steps we go through to produce the Navy chair

159
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
That's why I took a visit

160
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
To the factory

161
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
In Pennsylvania

162
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
The first step

163
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
Actual sheets of aluminum

164
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
This sheet

165
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,455
Is the Sheep will use to make seat bottoms from

166
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:21,343
One of the most distinctive elements of an emeco Navy chair is the butt shaped divot

167
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,439
Legend has it it was modeled after the derriere of Betty Grable

168
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
A famous Hollywood actor

169
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
The 1940s

170
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
But there's absolutely no evidence for this plan

171
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,911
Growing up and friends would come over to our house and get the giggles about

172
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
That's Jay buchbinder she was named for her grandfather Greg's father and she recently started work

173
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Working at Amica

174
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Oh man

175
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,479
Now we're off to welding

176
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,063
I didn't see much automation at the emeco factory

177
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,391
Just a number of very skilled craftspeople

178
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,439
This is walter white now he's

179
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,767
Routing holes into the aluminum extruded

180
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
2

181
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,119
In order to accept crossbars that go into the two

182
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
Dennis case the famous

183
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
3

184
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
Vertical slats

185
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,567
The back of the emeco chair is curved like an upside-down U

186
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,151
And the three vertical slats come down from the top of this you

187
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
And made a curved crossbar

188
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,575
The three slots don't go all the way to the Sea they intersect with the crossbar 3/4 of the way down

189
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,903
Turn the most distinctive design elements of the immigration

190
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,719
Okay so now we're going over into

191
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,327
Are Department three witches grinding all the whales have to be ground down except 3

192
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,935
The original chair they made for the Navy had a lump of welding I need to join

193
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:45,055
But when the fancy designer started working with hammock out they found all the welds to be a little crude

194
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,847
So emeco ground down

195
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:51,967
Except for the three welds where the vertical slats meet the arch on the back of the chair

196
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
We leave

197
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,319
These three Wells on the back

198
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Hazard signature

199
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,183
After the chairs have gone through all this heavy work

200
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,487
They go through a series of water bath

201
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,839
There's a total of 5 bass 1 2 3 4 5

202
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
In order to

203
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
Perfect

204
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
This process

205
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,775
After 5 salt baths in a 9 and a 320 degree oven

206
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,895
This aluminum chair is 3 times stronger than steel

207
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,967
Turn of the opposite of planned obsolescence

208
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,295
Many of the designers who work with them ago

209
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,903
Want to see this elaborate process and make the trip out to Pennsylvania to meet the workers

210
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,975
Like the famous industrial designer Philippe Starck

211
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
Visit was filmed by Greg

212
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
I was obliged

213
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Call myself

214
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
I miss you

215
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
Because

216
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
Like a sister

217
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
You make

218
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
Scripture

219
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
I just got a new refrigerator you reproduce

220
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
Description

221
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,175
Everyday by Android and biceps

222
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
It's a beauty

223
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
That's why

224
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
When you see

225
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
Yorkshire

226
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
UC

227
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,719
According to Greg when designers visit the factory

228
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:11,583
I Come Away with a deeper appreciation of the workers and the value of the chair

229
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
Beyond its shape

230
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
When I take it architect

231
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,239
The one thing that they always say is

232
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
You should charge more

233
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
For this chair

234
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359
A lot of Architects must have a pretty big chair but

235
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,663
Because emeco chairs are not inexpensive

236
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
Anew 1006 Navy chair will set you back

237
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
About $550

238
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,087
But you can get an emeco look-alike chair

239
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
For a lot less

240
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
There are several websites

241
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
That have

242
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,511
Listings from vendors of

243
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Thanks

244
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Counterfeit

245
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Chairs

246
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
That's Madison BookFinder

247
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Greg's wife

248
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
Cheetahs price for the company

249
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
But she also has this ritual

250
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,823
Where she wakes up every morning and scour the number of e-commerce sites

251
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Perfect

252
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
And those sites are house

253
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
And eBay

254
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Amazon

255
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
And

256
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Alibaba

257
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
We have very good luck

258
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
If it's any

259
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
Exact

260
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Copy

261
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
I can get those off and

262
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Heartbeat

263
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
When companies don't comply with their requests

264
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
To take down the look-alike

265
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
Amoco can take the company to court

266
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
This is what happened in 2012

267
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,519
When Restoration Hardware started selling the naval chair

268
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
They even knocked off a name

269
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
So when

270
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
Someone is a

271
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
A counterfeiter

272
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,759
That's typically the kind of things they do in order to give their

273
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Product

274
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
Fake authenticity

275
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,391
Restoration Hardware settled with Amoco

276
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
Before the case went to court

277
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,487
Greg's also got another big box

278
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,815
Like Target and Ikea to knock it off with a knock off

279
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,143
He can do this because he has trade dress protection

280
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,799
Trade dress protection is designed to protect consumers from the look-alike imitations of name brand products

281
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,615
He's not pressing the function or use of the product

282
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,687
It's just the dress how it looks and for emeco

283
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
That means the chair shape

284
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
That shape belongs

285
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
2 m Koh

286
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,599
Nobody can reproduce that shape

287
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
So

288
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
Having that

289
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,023
Kind of protection allows us to be very aggressive when when we need to be

290
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
But I'm at a lawyer

291
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
Christopher sprigman who doesn't think Amoco

292
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
Deserves this

293
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,031
So consumers in the marketplace when they look at this chair

294
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
Unless they are real furniture aficionados

295
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
They don't think oh this is Amica

296
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
I think oh that's a chair

297
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,991
Right or that's a pretty chair that chair would look good in my living room

298
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
I don't think that the shape of the chair is distinct

299
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:45,439
It's a it's an office chair design it's been around I have pictures of it from the twenties and department stores in office

300
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,511
If the cigars litigation I think I would have

301
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
Clear

302
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
Trade dress protection

303
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
Is really hard to get for design Prada

304
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
And Christopher sprigman building

305
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
If a macaw

306
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
Ever does end up in court

307
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
It risk

308
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Losing this production

309
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,151
What really bothers Christopher is companies like emeco and Herman Miller and vitra

310
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,223
Turning to the law to take knockoffs out of marketplace

311
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,807
To the extent that that succeeds these designs become

312
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,879
The territory of the Rich and no one else can access them

313
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
But I just wanted

314
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,791
Put a fine point on this so this is a family company that's their business and I understand that they care about that

315
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
But let me just

316
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,399
Say that out there in the world are a bunch of consumers who want to

317
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,447
Furnish their homes

318
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
This is a country where not everyone is rich

319
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
If you want to be

320
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,359
Stylish and have a house that's nice and you don't have a ton of money

321
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
You might buy knockoff chairs

322
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
In his book The knockoff economy

323
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,551
Christopher makes the argument that these kinds of protection

324
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
Given to expensive things like

325
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Chairs in clothing

326
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
Is actually bad for consumers

327
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
Because for most people

328
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,255
Knockoffs are as close as they can get

329
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
To the real

330
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
One of the things that's real about them is

331
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
They're there for

332
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,959
The rest of us right they they they bring the rest of us into

333
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,359
The world of the artist right they allow us to participate in the fashion world even if we can't afford the stuff

334
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
That is paraded on the runway

335
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
They allow us to participate in the world of

336
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
Industrial design

337
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
Furniture kitchen appliances

338
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,319
Does etcetera even if we can't afford

339
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
The super expensive

340
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Browns

341
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
That's democratizing

342
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
I think it makes the country

343
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
You prettier and more enjoyable

344
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
But for Greg Amico knock-offs

345
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,631
Also make the country the whole planet worse

346
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
By filling landfill

347
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
What's with garbage chair

348
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
Oliver product is engineered

349
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
To be made

350
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
For the longest life possible

351
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
Anak office is

352
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,943
Is Shirley made to be

353
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Seoul

354
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Used

355
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
Thrown away

356
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
Great Clips

357
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,391
Probably still make nice chairs for less money

358
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
But it takes

359
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
77 steps to

360
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,255
Make a torpedo proof chair

361
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Torpedo proof chair

362
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
Will last 250 years

363
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
The goal is to

364
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
To produce something

365
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
Where it has the least impact

366
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
Environmentally

367
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
All the way through

368
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
And has the longest life

369
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,919
To me that's the very best kind of product can you do

370
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,527
Greg genuinely cares about sustainability

371
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:25,183
I spent just a few days with him but I know he thinks food tastes worse when it's served in disposable

372
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
And that he travels with his own silverware

373
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,071
This is why he wishes he could use the law

374
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
To go after

375
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
The lookalikes

376
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
And the almost

377
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Looks like

378
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
Like the popular lightweight aluminum Delta

379
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,567
The chair from Crate & Barrel

380
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
I showed him a photo of his

381
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
What is this a fake

382
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
Absolutely Frank

383
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
What they've done here is they

384
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,063
They put instead of three bars on the vertical back they put

385
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
4 bars

386
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
Instead of having a

387
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
Horizontal

388
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Or

389
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,487
Towards the bottom they take these

390
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,303
Or vertical bars and bring them all the way down

391
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
The seat bottom

392
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
But

393
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
It's the same

394
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,959
Tube-shaped it's bent the same way the legs are the same configuration

395
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,799
The seat bottom has the bomb dipping if the front legs have the taper

396
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
This is May 2

397
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Look like anime

398
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Chair

399
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
We have a good look after dental work

400
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Amazing

401
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,599
Benjamin took me to a Crate & Barrel in Manhattan to show me the chair in question

402
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:29,695
I think we have to go in this room I came in here looking for the other day

403
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:37,375
And look what these bastards did with us knock off

404
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
Of the

405
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,407
To The Crate & Barrel chair is different enough to avoid a lawsuit

406
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,991
But it retain those signature welds of the emeco chair

407
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
To give it that handcraft

408
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
To feel

409
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,111
But even if they mimic the wellness according to Greg

410
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,207
There will always be one key difference between the emeco chair

411
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
And this one

412
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:07,839
It it won't last it's not designed to last as long as our Cheerios

413
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
Greg is fairly certain

414
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
It wouldn't pass the original test

415
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
Turn off that 8 story building

416
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Of course

417
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
There's really only one way to find out

418
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,455
The helicopter noise to the helicopter

419
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:29,087
Now that I have you on my roof on the 7th floor with the knockoff

420
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
Crate & Barrel

421
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
I kind of

422
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
I think the ultimate test is throwing it off

423
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
See what happened

424
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,143
You're on your own for that when you do that on your so there's no absolutely not

425
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
Let me hear what happens next

426
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,287
You're going to have to go to The Theory of Everything Everything me

427
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:02,623
When it's here is designed specifically to be affordable and that becomes expensive

428
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,927
And then affordable knockoffs are created

429
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,719
Which is the real chair

430
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,791
Percocet and I talk more about fake chair

431
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
After that

432
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Between the beats

433
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,495
Bongs and chatter of our devices

434
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,079
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

435
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:27,711
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

436
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:33,599
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remembrall hearing that voice

437
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
Technology talk to us

438
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,439
It is a creation of Sonic trap

439
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,511
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

440
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,095
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

441
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,143
To make them more human

442
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
Turn the living room lights on

443
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Okay

444
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
Dim the living room lights to 50

445
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
80%

446
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Okay

447
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:02,783
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

448
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,599
Makes for a much more natural experience

449
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
Turn the living room lights on

450
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,231
Dim the living room lights to 50

451
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
Resent

452
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:19,167
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

453
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
About how are sounds gay

454
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
Is impacting our health

455
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,543
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

456
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,615
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

457
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
Right here on the 99.

458
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,015
We need to talk about something

459
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,575
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

460
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:42,975
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is from

461
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:48,607
Frustrating it doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

462
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,191
You don't know why and it may be time to seek help

463
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,263
Go to oh my God. Info podcast

464
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,383
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

465
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,919
Oh my God. Info

466
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
Flat pocket

467
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,551
Charles and Ray Eames were to America's most influential modern designers

468
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,415
In the mid-1900s they made all kinds of architectural products graphics

469
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Films

470
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Some toys

471
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
And

472
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Furniture

473
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,887
You probably seen their iconic lounge chair it's very distinctive features of molded plywood frame set on a metal base

474
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
And it's usually top

475
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,703
Black leather upholstery

476
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:31,103
There are plenty of knockoffs of this chair and it's matching ottoman is here to talk about another chair of their

477
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,687
I'm more utilitarian Jared like Emma goes that also get

478
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
It's copied a lot

479
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:42,367
Charles Eames once said that their 1950s lounge chair was designed to be soft and cushy because he was sick of people

480
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,183
Complaining about how uncomfortable modern furniture

481
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,023
Answer those complaints were pretty understandable

482
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,839
In response to what are the other best sellers

483
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
Design a few years earlier

484
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,167
A series of molded fiberglass

485
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
Best Chairs

486
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
So I know this one and you probably encounter.

487
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
I kind of think of it as the school chair it's a

488
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
Has metal legs that you can stock up and

489
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
Is this mean seat pieces

490
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,967
Molded into a curvy L shape

491
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,759
And then there are various account

492
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:16,159
Arms are no worms that can have different legs different thousand faces all I kind of saw

493
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:22,560
Buyers could pick a base for the home or pick one for the office you have something more minimalist or something more stylish

494
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:27,424
But the chairs weren't just designed to look nice they were also meant to be affordable and functional

495
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,728
So they were low-cost easy to master

496
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
Mapreduce

497
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
Easy to move around easily

498
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
Keep clean

499
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:38,944
Actually the first prototype was built for an international competition for low-cost Furniture Design

500
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
Which was hosted by

501
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,272
Museum of Modern Art New York City

502
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,320
And so did it actually win this compass

503
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:48,160
Actually no second place

504
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:53,792
You know $3,000 a piece or so

505
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:58,656
Jury reportedly like that modular approach but they may have taken off points

506
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,448
Because the Prototype was made a stamp

507
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,496
Still and that's a tricky

508
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
Inexpensive material to work with

509
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
Takes these

510
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,104
High pressures and high temperatures

511
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,896
24 Mass

512
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
Actually switch

513
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,480
2 fiber reinforced plastic

514
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:16,320
And because the chairs are made up of just a few pieces they were easy to assemble

515
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,392
And that sounds a lot different from the 77 step process

516
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,696
That's great the aluminum Navy chair

517
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,768
Really is and that Simplicity is by Design

518
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,840
But these different areas do actually have something in common

519
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
Knock-off companies love to make copies

520
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,520
And according to One Source I found one of these molded Eames chair variants

521
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,336
This one that has what's called the Eiffel Tower base

522
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,360
Which is the son of

523
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,920
Four legs with these criss-crossing middle connectors

524
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,712
Is actually one of the most copied

525
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,992
Chairs in the world today

526
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,040
But if they were designed to be affordable

527
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
What is the incentive

528
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,856
And make copies of them

529
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,184
YouTubers that are officially licensed by vitra

530
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
Actually self

531
00:22:54,464 --> 00:23:00,096
Over $500 emeco Navy chair

532
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,448
Given the same quote that Victor has up on their website

533
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,752
Getting the most of the best

534
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,312
To the greatest number of people for the lease

535
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,408
And maybe the real ones really are much higher quality

536
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
Einstein

537
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,712
Bill seems really high

538
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,784
And so are these copies illegal copies license

539
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
David Woodward

540
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
Deal with them

541
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
Will it varies by place

542
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
And in the UK for instance

543
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,488
Suspicions were originally protected up to 25 years from the date

544
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
Of creation

545
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,816
In 2016 they change the rules

546
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,400
Onexton coverage up to 70 years after the death of the

547
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
Creator and

548
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,752
Of course that shifted the legal status of a lot of modern classic

549
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
But also

550
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,360
Arne Jacobsen egg chair beast and Rose

551
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
Barcelona chair Le corbusier

552
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
Lc2 sofa

553
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
It sounded good cheese

554
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,600
Class table vitra the company that owns the rights to the molded Eames chairs

555
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,136
Really push for this chain

556
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Which is not

557
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
So when tears went from being protective

558
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,048
For 25 years after its creation to 70 years after the death of

559
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
The Creator

560
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,096
What did

561
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
People say

562
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:09,984
Only UK a lot of people saw the news and rushed out to buy replicas

563
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
Ahead of the new laws taking effect

564
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,104
And when all this started advertising a pair of

565
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,408
Retro style Eiffel chairs

566
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,712
440 lb it went viral

567
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,248
Never opinions on all sides

568
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,576
Some argue that these very ghetto reprehensible knock

569
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
Eames Originals

570
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:31,232
But this one architect and design critic who writes The Guardian defended the copies

571
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Asking

572
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,072
Isn't this exactly what Charles Eames would have

573
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,144
What do you think Charles and Ray Eames would have

574
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
Settebello

575
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,752
Obviously we'll we'll never know for sure

576
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
Give them their design philosophy

577
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
I really

578
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:50,432
Just keep wondering if maybe they'd have seen these affordable copies

579
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,272
As more real than fake and some cents

580
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,832
Because Max accessibility was a big

581
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
Part of the original design intent

582
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,672
So I guess it just depends on

583
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
Maybe what themes

584
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
Valued more

585
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
The shape of this chair

586
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Or

587
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:13,216
What was made to do right and it comes back to this question two of you know what makes a design is it the shape of the thing is it the

588
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
The function

589
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,800
Doing what it's designed to do

590
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,592
Hibbett

591
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,872
If it's not too expensive

592
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,408
In that case

593
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,736
It is failing to do one of the things was designed to do
