I'm Roman Mars

32
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,328
In 1883 Samuel Clemens Alias Mark Twain published his memoir

33
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
Life on the Mississippi

34
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Init

35
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,448
Queen describes his love for the Great River

36
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,264
And Howard captured his imagination from Boyhood

37
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
In fact

38
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
The pen name Mark Twain

39
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,920
Probably a reference to what a deckhand on a Mississippi riverboat

40
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
Call out

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
To indicate a depth of two fathoms

42
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,232
These are recordings Murio Steamboat worker from 1939

43
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,608
Twain would have heard this call many times

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,424
As a young man he worked as a steamboat pilot

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
On the Mississippi

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,800
This was a job that required him to learn everything there is to know about the red

47
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
That's a Ryan Kyle

48
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,408
He's a reporter at New Orleans Public Radio

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,944
Working on steamboats

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,504
When would come to memorize every Scholl

51
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
Bend Rock

52
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,648
Island Bluff Reef wind Reef Eddie snag sandbar

53
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,720
And he would learn how all those things change

54
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,024
When the river was high or when it was

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
Is low

56
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Incomm breezes

57
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
High win

00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120

00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Date

00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Wayne Road

61
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,240
The face of the water became a wonderful

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,456
Mark Twain loved working on the river but he found it came with a price

63
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:05,088
Has he gained knowledge about the workings of the Mississippi he began to lose something to

64
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
A sense of wonder

65
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
About the Great River

66
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,952
Twain writes about this in his memoir

67
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,816
I had lost something which could never be restored to me while I live

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
All the grace

69
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Beauty

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
Had gone out

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,128
But not everyone had such a complicated relationship with the river

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,456
For many people who live near the Mississippi it was simple

73
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
The river was a force

74
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
To be reckoned

75
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
When you talk about the Mississippi River

76
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
To me it's not something saying

77
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
This

78
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
Great force

79
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
I'm enormous power

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,096
This is John Berry an expert on the river's history

81
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,168
He served on the Levee Board of New Orleans

82
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
And has written extensively about the Mist

83
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
And the thing to know about the river

84
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
Especially back then

85
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
Was that it

86
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Flooded

87
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
All the time

88
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,968
A river flight or at least I know flood like the Mississippi

89
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
You can see coming for weeks

90
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Fight it

91
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,136
4 weeks in in 1927 people knew the river

92
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,536
Was coming for them nine straight months the middle of the country have been getting hit nearly

93
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,935
Non-stop with rain and the previous winter there been tremendous snow fall river in Minnesota

94
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
Who's now washing Downstream the levees were strained and in February of 1927

95
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:35,711
They started giving out y75 was probably worse than Katrina

96
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,015
Roughly a million Americans

97
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,855
Almost 1% of the entire population of the country at the time

98
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,415
Flooded out of their homes

99
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,767
That's spring 145 levees along the Lower River

100
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
Fail

101
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
27000 square miles

102
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
Penn State

103
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
Or put under water

104
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,055
It's unclear how many people died because for One Thing official counts didn't include black people

105
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,383
But the death toll was likely upwards of a thousand

106
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,479
On April 30th 1927 then Secretary of Commerce

107
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
Herbert Hoover

108
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
Discuss the play

109
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,319
On a national radio broadcast

110
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,671
Everything humanly possible is being done by men of magnificent

111
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
Courage and skill

112
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
Oncoming Rush

113
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Metal

114
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,607
The engineers are directing

115
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
You got to remember

116
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
This was enormous news

117
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
Dominated

118
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
The front page

119
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Lindbergh

120
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Flew across

121
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
The Atlantic in the middle

122
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Flood that's the only thing that

123
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
Knocked it off the top

124
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
And after the flight

125
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
Looks like Meats back on

126
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,575
In the wake of the flood Congress essentially declared war on the Mississippi River

127
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,671
I passed a law called The Flood Control Act of 1928

128
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
Apart of

129
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
28 Act

130
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,303
Involves studying basically every major

131
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
River basin

132
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:59,423
A River Basin is all the land that water flows through on its way to a river

133
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,239
Sabrina sample if it rains in South Dakota

134
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
Anywhere in the whole state

135
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,847
That rain will eventually make its way to the Mississippi

136
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,431
Which means that South Dakota is part of the Mississippi River basin

137
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,015
Even though it's actually pretty far from the Mississippi River

138
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,111
In 1928 Congress decided to study rivers and their basin

139
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,695
Especially the Mississippi and it's enormous basin

140
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
Which includes more than 30 States

141
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
And not just study them but

142
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
Also changed

143
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,143
The Flood Control Act charged the US Army Corps of Engineers

144
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
With designing and executing

145
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,495
Plan to Corral and maneuver them

146
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
To better manage

147
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Abs

148
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Lowe's

149
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,127
So that future disasters could be a bird

150
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,943
With the Army Corps of Engineers face a dilemma

151
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,551
The river control system that they had been tasked with creating needed to be

152
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,391
Huge much bigger than anything they never built before

153
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,487
And I didn't want to just jump into building something until they knew it would work

154
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,791
They started constructing scale model

155
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,095
Different parts of the Mississippi River basin

156
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,887
In order to understand them

157
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Hammocks at the river

158
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,007
The earliest ones were ditches cut into the dirt with water running through

159
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,407
The models help forecast flooding in St Louis the impact of a dam Construction in Ohio the working

160
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,967
Kings of spillways in New Orleans and Florida

161
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:21,087
But the Army Corps of Engineers wanted a way to test the entire river system all at once

162
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,743
So in 1941 they started building a model to represent all 1.25 million square

163
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
Square miles of the Mississippi River basin

164
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,655
When you think of a scale model you might be thinking of something you can peer into a museum

165
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
Not so with this one

166
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
This would be bigger than

167
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
Anything they could ever fit into a display case

168
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,615
Is a jungle out there

169
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,967
The Mississippi Basin model located just outside of Jackson Mississippi

170
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,039
Is a scale replica of the entire Basin region

171
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,623
An area that spans from Appalachia to the Rocky Mountains

172
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,951
Nearly half of the continental United States

173
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
We'll have to crawl through here

174
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,863
Check I hope we don't get your equipment

175
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,751
I went out to see the model with a woman named Jamie Vaughn

176
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
Cheese to work at the model as a

177
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
The technician

178
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,871
Before it was decommissioned in the early 90s

179
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,431
Jenny showed me how to sneak in

180
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,247
Right through a wall of poison ivy

181
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
I just always ask

182
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
Did any snakes

183
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Will

184
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,695
You know kind of runoff

185
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,279
We're also there with former project engineer Wayne O'Neill

186
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
I'm waiting on you

187
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Amici

188
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Now that we've made it through the IV

189
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
We make our way to this

190
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
Enormous

191
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
And this

192
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,847
Is the beautiful Mississippi River

193
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
Macy Mississippi Basin model

194
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,967
Wow in all its Glory

195
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Wow

196
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:00,671
Ryan is looking down in a three-dimensional map a completely man-made landscape

197
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
Hills and ridges

198
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
Big winding River bat

199
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:10,399
Every foot of the model represents 2000 feet in a real-world if you take a good step

200
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
You stepped off a mile

201
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,263
It's hard to overstate how enormous this model is

202
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,079
Is about 2 1/2 times the size of Disneyland

203
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,383
125 city blocks

204
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
I saw some pictures online but

205
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,991
This does not prepare you to Caesars thing

206
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
It's awesome isn't it

207
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,879
Just also

208
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
You just can't take it all in at once

209
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,535
Damian Wayne tell me that you can really only see all the edges of it

210
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,351
If you climb up this for story observations

211
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
There's also a water tower

212
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
Looming about them

213
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,495
Turn the pipe shooting off in every direction

214
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
In the pump houses

215
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Spigots

216
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
These big hulking machines

217
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
Strange looking instruments

218
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Dottling

219
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,687
What they had

220
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
Envisioned when they

221
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Built this

222
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
It's just

223
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Fantastic

224
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
Back when the model was operational

225
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
There were little sign

226
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
For pretty much every town in

227
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,303
That would be one for Vicksburg and Rolling Fork

228
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
And all along

229
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,935
The signs are gone now but Jamie still knows the geography of this place

230
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
Buy Hardware around Baton Rouge

231
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,591
So you can go from Baton Rouge up to St Louis in about

232
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
10 minutes

233
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:32,831
The Army Corps of Engineers started work on the Mississippi Basin model in 1941

234
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
And it first

235
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
They faced a massive labor shortage

236
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
Start of the model came about during World War II

237
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
No labor

238
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
What's available

239
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:46,143
Everybody was off at War there wasn't troops are people here to do it

240
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:53,055
So they built a bill to be Camp here to supply the labor German prisoners-of-war help with every fast

241
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
Of the construction

242
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,151
And they did the groundwork and the

243
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,223
Typography layout and the drainage system

244
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
For the model

245
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,063
By 1949 the model was ready

246
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,975
Staff of 600 engineers and technicians with calibrate the model by recreating past floods in the region

247
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,023
Then they'd forecast new flow

248
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,607
They would run thousands of gallons of water through the model

249
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
Recording the waters height

250
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
After it was all done

251
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
Did change a few variables

252
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,823
More sandbags over here open this

253
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
Spillway over there they played around with the motto

254
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,711
Gathering data on how each piece of the river system

255
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Affected the whole

256
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,319
Then they could use that data to come up with better plans for

257
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
The future

258
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
Like they did in 1950

259
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,207
When Council Bluffs in Sioux City Iowa were threatened with a

260
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
1952

261
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
The model predicted

262
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
Where the ladies were going over top

263
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,423
Overtop as in where the water would spill over the Levee

264
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,823
And so they ran the model night and day as they were fighting the flood what they were doing here it'll overtop here

265
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,871
Your put your sandbags but you working this area

266
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,711
And of a predicted stages with into tenths of a foot

267
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,783
Meaning the model mimics the actual behavior of them

268
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
Mississippi to Within

269
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
Inches

270
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,695
It was credited to saving over 50 million dollars in damage in 52

271
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,511
That's about half a billion dollars in today's money

272
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,839
The Mississippi Basin model was amazingly Act

273
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,911
Dealing with these incredibly complex

274
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
Hyper-specific

275
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Problems

276
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:29,823
The model save the government millions and millions of dollars while it was in operation

277
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,919
Inspired people from the kinds of disastrous flooding that had happen

278
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
Back in 1927

279
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:42,367
But two hundred acres of pipes pumps and machinery and Earth movers and a staff of hundreds were expensive

280
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
To maintain

281
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,231
Because got even harder to justify after the Advent of the computer

282
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,863
Late sixties early seventies there was a big push to go into numerical models

283
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
Math model

284
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,727
The numerical model playful and

285
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,031
Core looked at the mall us as well

286
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
We don't need it anymore

287
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
Expensive

288
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
Gradually the Mississippi Basin model

289
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,479
Lost its funding he saw the handwriting on the wall and it

290
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
The closing is down

291
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,831
The computer models weren't is good but they were good enough

292
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,647
And the Army Corps could not or would not

293
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,719
Pay for the gigantic River Basin model anymore

294
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,535
The muscle is used in a diminished capacity

295
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Until 1990

296
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
When it was closed for Good

297
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
Today it's

298
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
Completely Darrell

299
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
Damn this place is depressing

300
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Rap

301
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,079
Everytime I come out here at work

302
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
A lot of Labor there's a lot of

303
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Lovin

304
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
And when did this thing and it is just

305
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
Abandon

306
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,599
I feel like if I was a teenager this would be my number one

307
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
Come get high and

308
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,159
Get in trouble spot exactly

309
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Exactly

310
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,279
The pipes in the pump house is rotting and rusting away

311
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
And in the model

312
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,631
The Earth and mud and water of all dried up

313
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,447
Now it's just a disheveled mess

314
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
Concrete and

315
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,567
Wire mesh I've seen the original design drawings this place

316
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
Those engineers

317
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
I would be doing good to sharpen your pencil

318
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
You know the mind that came up

319
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
With all those pieces of

320
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,295
Equipment with the knowledge they had in the 40s

321
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
And they're coming up with

322
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,159
Ways to protect people and make the stuff work

323
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
You just don't see

324
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
Engineering feats

325
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
Like that everyday

326
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:31,935
Now in a normal public radio story this would be the part where we would bemoan the death of craftsmanship in Rome

327
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,031
Mark on all the things we've lost by choosing virtual things over physical ones

328
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
But before you get to Misty eye

329
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,639
You have to see where Jenny Wang work now

330
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,967
How's it going pretty good

331
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
Hey did you get any

332
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,831
Poison Ivy the other day I didn't I didn't

333
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:54,975
About two weeks after going to the Basin model Ryan that Janie at the US army engineer research and development center

334
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Verdict

335
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,047
In Vicksburg Mississippi

336
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:03,423
I keep forgetting that you actually work for the Army and like badge in the real deal

337
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
Mama jokes

338
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,799
Yeah walking around Arctic feels like being on the back lot of Hollywood

339
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
Studio

340
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,383
There's no after row a big hangar

341
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
Full of miniature landscape

342
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
Is hangers over there and

343
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
Hangers over there

344
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,623
Hangers with model and model and model and model just lined up

345
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
Engineer zip around and trucks

346
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
Golf cart

347
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
They test all kinds of things

348
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,815
Including a few things that and have nothing to do with what

349
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,911
One hanger I saw Engineers developing a temporary airplane

350
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,519
They were driving over it with the modified dump truck on 14ft tires

351
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
To simulate the weight of

352
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,431
Mostly Ehrlich build scale models of rivers and dams and water

353
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,783
Albeit smaller more manageable ones than the Mississippi motto

354
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
So we're looking at

355
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
Bluestone Dam

356
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
In Hinton

357
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
West Virginia

358
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
It's on the

359
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
New River

360
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,327
A place that actually did Flood recently

361
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,655
And the Army quarters models help to manage that flood

362
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,751
The Army Corps also uses the models as a public relations tool

363
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,335
Decor and bites people from local communities over to artic

364
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
So they can see how new projects

365
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,735
Like building new navigation channels or removing old dams will affect the area

366
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,855
Engineers at Artic say they take Community feedback and incorporate that into their designs

367
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,695
But here's the most surprising thing I learned about these physical model

368
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,791
The reason that engineer's continue to rely on them is because

369
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Today

370
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
In 2016

371
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,167
We still do not have the computers or the science

372
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
To do all the things

373
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
The physical model

374
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Girls can do this actually this

375
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,567
Realm of human knowledge

376
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
Physical

377
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
Behavior and how the Earth Works

378
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
That we don't understand

379
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,015
This is Stanford Gibson

380
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,831
Senior hydraulic engineer for the Army Corps

381
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,671
This is a guy with a PhD and three Masters

382
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
Even the math

383
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,815
He can do isn't sufficient to fully describe what happens in a river

384
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
I think that there

385
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,679
Needs to be a little bit of scientific humility to say

386
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Well

387
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:18,079
Maybe some of these processes are outside of our reach at least outside of the reach of Our Generation

388
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,407
Are we going to get there we'll get closer

389
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,015
Believe It or Not Hydraulic Engineering it's in the some of the most complicated math there is

390
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,599
Allegedly when Albert Einstein son Hans that he wanted to

391
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,903
Study how sediment moves underwater

392
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,743
Einstein I asked him why he wanted to work on something so complicated

393
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,655
The physics involved happen on such a small scale that we still haven't built equations complex enough

394
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
The capture

395
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
Stanford Gibson

396
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,519
A world-class numerical model

397
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,079
Is actually one of the most Ardent supporter

398
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
A physical map

399
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
Because a physical model

400
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
Doesn't require equations at all

401
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
Physical model

402
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,271
Will stimulate the processes

403
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
On its own

404
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,647
And even if Stanford Gibson develops new numerical model

405
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,975
The process is inherently tied to the natural world

406
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
When I start a new project

407
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,071
I go and I rent a kayak

408
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
I float the river

409
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,935
Because there are too many processes that you don't understand that

410
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,471
You can't represent in the equation

411
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,311
Stanford the more time you spend on the river the more you learn it

412
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Secrets

413
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
Kind of like Mark Twain

414
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,199
And all those years he spent working on Steamboat

415
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,503
Learning to read the Mississippi

416
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Like a book

417
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,367
You know it did you ever read Mark Twain life on the Mississippi by did

418
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,207
So you remember that whole like maybe a hundred Pages near the beginning

419
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,279
What are you talkin about the Mississippi for him was

420
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Like this

421
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
Magical

422
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
Mystic

423
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
Golang imbued with

424
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,703
Mystery and that once he learned the river

425
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,751
That was lost to him forever

426
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,567
I remember that moment exactly

427
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,383
Because that is exactly not my account

428
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,759
The idea that science demystifies the world

429
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
I just don't understand that

430
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:09,951
I feel like the kind of deeper down the scientific Rabbit Hole I go the bigger and grander and more Magical Door

431
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
World famous

432
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,887
And the same goes for going down the rabbit holes of history and engineering and Mathematics and Design

433
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,703
If there's one thing I believe more than anything

434
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,495
Is that knowledge

435
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
Creates Wonder

436
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,503
99percentinvisible was pretty so sweet by Ryan Kyla same Greenspan and Delaney Hall with Sharif Youssef Katie Mingle

437
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,063
Kolstad Avery truffelman and me Roman Mars

438
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,671
Mark Twain was played by Ken toys and Herbert Hoover was refused

439
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:47,583
I love the music in this episode came from some of our favorite favorite musicians including lullatone melodium and

440
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351

446
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,063
And beautiful

Between the beats

450
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,399
Bongs and Charter of our devices

451
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,983
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

452
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
If

453
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:33,407
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexa is talking to me and my wife isn't

454
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:37,503
Call hearing.

455
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,295
Technology talk to us

456
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,343
It is a creation of Sonic trap

457
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,415
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

458
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,999
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

459
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,047
To make them more human

460
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
Turn the living room lights on

461
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Okay

462
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
Dim the living room lights to 50

463
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
80%

464
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
Okay

465
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:06,687
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

466
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,503
Makes for a much more natural experience

467
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
Turn the living room lights on

468
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,647
Dim the living room lights to 50%

469
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:23,072
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

470
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
About how are sounds gay

471
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,888
Is impacting our health

472
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,448
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

473
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

474
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
Right here on the 99 pi

475
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,920
We need to talk about something

476
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,480
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

477
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:46,880
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

478
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:52,512
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

479
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,096
And you don't know why then it may be time to seek help

Before we go I want to tell you about the body Genie

502
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,440
Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

503
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,536
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a

504
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

505
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
We're looking the part

506
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,656
Might cost you your life

507
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,776
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

508
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:44,128
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

509
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,480
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

510
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,088
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

511
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,136
Actually if I'm being honest

512
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,440
I'm one of the main guys who know how to do that kind of

513
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,864
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

514
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,192
Was found dead in my private gym

515
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,520
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

516
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,872
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

517
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,200
Now I need to clear my name

518
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:24,576
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

519
