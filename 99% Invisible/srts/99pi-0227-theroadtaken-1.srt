It really is almost everything

24
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,704
Infrastructure is just about everything that makes

25
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,496
Civilization physics

26
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,520
Possible

Dams

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,432
So forth the physical

33
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,480
Part of civilization is

34
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,760
The infrastructure

35
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
Mets Henry Petroski

36
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:32,672
Well my name is Henry Petroski I'm a professor of civil engineering and history at Duke University

37
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,976
He's written a number of books about catastrophic

38
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
Failures in engineering

39
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
And also one about the history of the toothpick

40
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
So he's one of us

41
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,424
His most recent book is all about

42
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,776
The name of the book is the road taken the history and Future

43
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
America's infrastructure

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
Couple weeks ago I interviewed.

45
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896
Trotsky about his book in the

46
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
The state of infrastructure

47
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
The US

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
The first of many things that I learned that

49
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Xiaomi

50
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,368
Was that the word infrastructure itself is actually kind of new to English

51
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:07,488
What we call infrastructure today used to be called Public Works and did America Public Works

52
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Was probably

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,352
A familiar term up until the 1980s

54
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,168
But Public Works became a term

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,984
Closely associated with what was called

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
Pork barrel

57
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
Which was

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,336
Also considered

59
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,640
Rent a rather pejorative term because

60
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176
It had to do with

61
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,992
Building things that were considered unnecessary

62
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Or wasteful

63
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
Pork barrel is government

64
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,368
Spending pushed forward by a congressperson

65
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Casoli benefits

66
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
The people in their home District

67
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,256
It was associated with politics

68
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Start

69
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
Was a tit-for-tat

70
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
You vote for my poor call vote for yours

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,776
But the connection between Public Works and government corruption got even worse than trading votes it reads to

72
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
It's pecan 1973

73
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,968
There was a major Scandal that one of our vice presidents of the United States had to resign Spiro Agnew

74
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504
New because he basically

75
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
Was

76
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,880
Taking money for Road contracts in his home state of Maryland

77
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,280
Send the 1980s when shrinking government was becoming all the rage and pork barrel and earmarks were our biggest enemy

78
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Did the Soviets

79
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
The term Public Works

80
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
Fell out of fashion

81
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
Infrastructure

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,216
Became a term

83
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
That replaced Public Works

84
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
Generally

85
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,152
But the term was still so new that in the 1980s The Wall Street Journal put in first

86
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
Within quotation

87
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:38,368
Since infrastructure is the physical part of civilization it's hard to generalize

88
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,952
Which government body or private party is responsible

89
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
Fergie to individual part of

90
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,816
So when our conversation we tended to focus on the big

91
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
Well let's take roads

92
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,656
We tend to think of Rose especially Highway

93
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,472
This is one of the wonderful things that the federal government

94
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
Well that's pretty much why

95
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Rhodes

96
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Today

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
In the United States are

98
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
Largely the responsibility of

99
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
Municipalities

100
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
And

101
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
States

102
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,040
One of the reasons that that's

103
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
Complicated like this is that the

104
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Federal government

105
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
It's not authorized

106
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
Bye

107
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
The Constitution

108
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,768
To build roads or bridges are even

109
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,351
Fixing them up by itself it has to go through the state

110
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,447
Article 1 Section 8 of the US Constitution states that the Federal Government Can Build

111
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Post Road

112
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Meaning

113
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,287
Routes for the post office to operate fact

114
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,615
But no other kinds of roads are Spotify

115
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,943
In fact in 1817 when bill was passed by

116
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,991
By Congress that approve the funding of

117
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,807
Internal improvements in the country like roads

118
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Ben Canales

119
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,391
It was vetoed by then President James Madison

120
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
Cuz he felt it was unconstitutional

121
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
And you should know

122
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Because he wrote

123
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
Constitution

124
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
The federal government can give

125
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
Awards to the states

126
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,935
You give grants to the states or municipalities but it it can't do it

127
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Itself

128
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,311
But what the feds can do is put a tax on gasoline to raise money for roads

129
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
Could stay then give to the states

130
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
10 cities

131
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,943
This has been the case since the Revenue Act of 1932 which was

132
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
Pacify her

133
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Hoover which re stacks

134
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Sazon pretty much ever

135
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
Presently it's 18.4%

136
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Per gallon

137
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
And that gives the federal government

138
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,999
About 30 billion dollars a year to distribute to the states

139
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,815
And that distribution the federal government X

140
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
Exercises Sun control

141
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:30,751
And enables it to provide some standardization to the roads which I consider a good thing

142
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,615
Me too because he don't really want to drive from one state to another and fun at the roads

143
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
Are completely different

144
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
It was the federal government that

145
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
Brought all the states

146
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
Into unification with

147
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
The

148
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
Colors of the

149
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:49,439
Lines on the roads yellow lines divide traffic when different ways white dashes divided Lanes

150
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
The same way

151
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,815
Federal government making money contingent on following a standard

152
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Is what

153
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
Make that happen

154
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:02,495
But the 30 billion dollar Federal Highway trust fund which is fed by the national gasoline tax

155
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,311
Isn't keeping up with our current needs

156
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,127
One easy solution of course would be to

157
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,431
Increase the gasoline tax

158
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,223
It hasn't been increased since

159
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
1993

160
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Quiet

161
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
While

162
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
Because the federal gas tax has been so stagnant

163
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,719
State state upon themselves to Levy their own State gas.

164
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
And funder road projects that way

165
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,839
Increasing the federal gas tax is not popular

166
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,375
So politicians have trouble

167
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Will doing it

168
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
But even if they could

169
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
It isn't a great solution

170
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:39,103
Obviously if you're going to depend upon the tax on gasoline per gallon

171
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
Or replenishing the fund then

172
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
You have to project how

173
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,807
Many gallons of gasoline are going to be used in weather

174
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
That

175
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,695
Volume of consumption is going to the Be steady or increase and generally we

176
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
Expect things like that to increase

177
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,351
Right now people are driving more electric and hybrid vehicles than ever before

178
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,679
They still use the roads but they spend less money at the gas

179
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,751
So Prius owners maybe saving the environment

180
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,055
But they are mooching off our roads

181
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
It is so hard to do right

182
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,455
So now there's an option to separate the collecting of taxes needed to maintain the road

183
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
From the consumption

184
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Can of gasoline

185
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
Instead of

186
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,575
Taxing the fuel that used

187
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
You text

188
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,391
The mileage that the vehicle

189
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
Travels on

190
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
State roads

191
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
Regardless of

192
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
Weather at uses fuel or not

193
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
And just to be done in a variety of ways

194
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,631
At present there are a number

195
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,679
Of pilot program

196
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
That are trying this out

197
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,335
There are pilot programs that involve self-reporting the number amount edry

198
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
But the obvious

199
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,175
Is David gps-based tracking device

200
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
Inside each car

201
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
And we'll see if that goes anywhere

202
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
Because if you're someone who gets freaked out about

203
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,879
The constitutionality of the federal government building roads

204
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:00,255
I'm going to guess that you're not going to be too keen on the federal government installing a tracking device in your

205
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
Cardizem

206
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:07,167
I suspect it will take at least a decade to replace the gas tax entirely

207
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,215
But it will probably come

208
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,031
Infrastructure is all about choices

209
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,567
When a new bridge is proposed

210
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
There are countless discussions about whether the bridge

211
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
Purely functional

212
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,807
Cheaper or if it should be a signature piece of architecture that attracts International attention

213
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,367
Their cases to be made on either side

214
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
Signature

215
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Myself

216
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,791
But even mundane features like roads involve choices that reverberate for decades

217
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,351
Most roads today that are Interstate roads

218
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
Are made of asphalt

219
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,215
Asphalt advantages of course is it at seamless

220
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,287
There is a real pleasure and driving on a new

221
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
Black asphalt road

222
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
Plus asphalt can be laid down quickly it's relative

223
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
Cheap and it's easy to patch and repair

224
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
The downside is

225
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
It's not especially durable

226
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
You actually have the patch repair quite a lot

227
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,391
Alternatively you can build a much more durable concrete road

228
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,975
Concrete doesn't offer that smooth seamless ride that ass

229
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
Does because

230
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Physics

231
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
With concrete we need

232
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,399
What are so-called Expansion Joints what appear to be

233
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Cracks

234
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,983
What are really deliberate lines

235
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,031
Cut into the concrete to allow it

236
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
The crack in a controlled way

237
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,943
The cracks are there so the throat doesn't break into pieces in the concrete contracts and expands due to Bigfoot

238
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
Fluctuations in temperature

239
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
But the tires of a vehicle

240
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
Going over there making noise in

241
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
Vehicle feels it when you're driving on a concrete road

242
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,511
And the ride is not as smooth as quiet as a

243
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,815
Can be on well-laid asphalt

244
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,887
In addition concrete roads are more expensive than

245
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
Send it to repair and they take long

246
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,799
But they aren't is prone to potholes and can last a lot longer than asphalt road

247
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
So decisions have to be made

248
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,943
Do we go with the cheaper quicker easier method and save money now

249
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
I'll go with the more expensive

250
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,831
Slower and less pleasing method and hope to save money on repairs and replacement cost

251
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Overtime

252
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
Since so many of these

253
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,951
Decisions are made in a political context

254
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
By people who

255
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,535
Know that they are going to

256
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
Probably move on

257
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,631
Before the Patriot Paving has to be

258
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Done

259
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
Will generally opt

260
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
For the Lesser expensive

261
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
Choice which means ask

262
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,591
Asphalt is simply cheaper than concrete

263
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
And therein is

264
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
One of the main reasons

265
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
That we have so much Asphalt in the

266
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Country

267
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,807
But there is a more radical choice

268
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,111
In Montpelier Vermont there was a road

269
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
Call Bliss route

270
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
Which was in a terrible

271
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
State of disrepair

272
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
For many years

273
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,767
It'll finally in 2009

274
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
Unpaved the road turn it into a dirt and gravel road

275
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
It's in 27 States

276
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,959
It's have also unpaid some of their roads for the same reason

277
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
I wondered if it was a clever solution or just

278
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
Demoralizing

279
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,847
I've heard about that

280
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:58,687
And that it does seem like a pretty clever solution it's

281
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:02,527
Probably not a very popular solution among the paving contractors

282
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
For example

283
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,975
It would it would depend on the nature of this road if this is a road that doesn't have especially heavy traffic

284
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
Not a lot of heavy truck traffic

285
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,815
It might work from an engineering

286
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Point of view

287
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
When the Eastern span of the Bay Bridge

288
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,959
It's about to open in 2013

289
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
They set aside a day

290
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Pedestrian

291
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
It's to walk the bridge

292
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,359
What's like people did in 1883 when the Brooklyn Bridge

293
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
I was all set to bring my kids

294
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,479
Celebrate this new massive piece of infrastructure

295
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,063
But because of last-minute repairs the event was cancelled

296
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,111
And the Bridge open to traffic with

297
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
Much less public involvement

298
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,023
And I really didn't get a sense that people were all that upset about it

299
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,327
We collect we just don't have the feeling that

300
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
Infrastructure warrant celebration

301
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
North Central Pride like we Once Dead

302
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Is October 12th

303
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,495
Why he thought that is

304
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
Oh I think

305
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
We

306
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
The electorate has

307
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,199
Your garden naturally lazy about the affair structure like we have

308
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
About a lot of things we tend to focus on

309
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
WhatsApp immediate concern to us

310
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
We we might worry more about our driveway

311
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,463
Dundee Highway that is nearby

312
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,023
I do think that celebratory events

313
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
Are important

314
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,887
And that do help generate that

315
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,471
Pride and almost responsibility because everybody's up

316
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
Part of all this

317
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,127
Different things that we we vote for in pay for in our our taxes in

318
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,711
And fees we're really part owner of of all that stuff

319
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
After we should worry about it is

320
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
As much as we do our

321
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
Our neighborhood

322
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,135
What do you think about the idea of reclaiming

323
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
The term Public Works

324
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,999
You know to reflect the fact that it is owned by all of us and that is is

325
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Public

326
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
That's a good idea

327
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
Haven't given it a great deal of thought but

328
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,655
That would make it more explicit

329
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
It's for the publican

330
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,287
By the public in in a in our way infrastructure is sexual

331
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,335
What is it a latinate word that

332
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127

335

So yeah that's that's an interesting idea

336
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,039
Well

337
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,623
I just thought about how good I have a proposal

338
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159

Turn the living room lights on

It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

374
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,807
