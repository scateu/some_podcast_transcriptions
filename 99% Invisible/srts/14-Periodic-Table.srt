Different than other

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
A scientific I

72
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
It's hard to get

73
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Take a look at it and get in

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
Information at a

75
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
Lance from it

76
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:19,424
Even though it probably hung in front of you every day that you went to school my guess is

77
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,776
Very little of its information really sunk in one of the bad design

78
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
It's not something that's

79
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Intuitive

80
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
Until you've done a lot of work

81
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
But the bad part

82
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,272
The impenetrability is far outweighed by

83
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:39,136
Precision and predictive power and here's where we should introduce

84
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
The hero

85
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
Of the story

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,792
All the hero of the story is Dmitri Mendeleev Russian science

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,912
Mendeleev was the first to come up with a periodic system there were five others before him

88
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,496
Still periodic table Mac Daddy

89
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,544
He came up with the design and

90
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Incorporated

91
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,128
More elements than the other scientist

92
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,736
He also knew enough to predict that there were

93
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
Pools on the periodic

94
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,064
You left gaps

95
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,368
That would be filled by later Elam

96
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
Discovered

97
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,512
I said he knew enough to be able to predict the properties of new elements

98
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
Based on

99
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,095
Where exactly the holes were at this was

100
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,631
Huge that's why he gets home

101
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Credit

102
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
A scientist

103
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,287
I'm in the way of love his table but everyone else was about to discover how awesome it was

104
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,847
When the first gap of the table was filled in

105
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,663
What element newly-christened galleon

106
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,759
This was discovered in 1875 by a Frenchman

107
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,343
The Galleon filled in the Gap right below aluminum and because of that

108
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,743
Mendeleev said should have properties like aluminum for the French scientist who discovered and named gallon found at the melting point

109
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
Was different

110
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
Then what Mendeleev predicted using the table

111
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
Check your results

112
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,007
Which is pretty insulting to say to another scientist

113
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,311
I'm in the lab is not about Consulting anybody

114
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,175
And I after another year or so it turned out that Mendeleev was correct

115
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,735
And the Frenchman had to retract his results

116
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,063
The entire scientific world of chemistry was astounded

117
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,671
That Mendeleev sitting in his office in St Petersburg

118
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
For he knew nothing about the

119
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,071
But he had been able to see the properties of gallium more clearly than the person who would actually do

120
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:29,471
Discovered it in Paris who actually held it in his hand just because of the table because he knew exactly where it was on the table

121
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
And what

122
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287
Properties it should have

123
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
That's when the periodic table

124
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:39,967
Stop to pee just a clever and nice looking arrangement of elements and really became a scientific

125
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
Tool that had real

126
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Predictive power

127
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,831
But for most of us who know nothing of the Alamo

128
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
What's on the table

129
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
Most of us

130
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,951

136
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,191
This moment right now is especially

137
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,263
Intriguing you're looking at the design of the periodic

138
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,567
Table because last spring

139
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,407
Scientists announced the discovery of an element on the bottom row

140
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,247
What was element 117 whose temporary name is inceptia

141
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
117

142
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Classic

143
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
Annette actually

144
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Pleated

145
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
The seventh row of

146
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,511
The periodic table is sort of squared it off in the bottom right

147
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Corner

148
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
And this is the only time

149
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,887
In history that we've ever had eight

150
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
Complete and full periodic

151
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,031
Tables the rest of the elements were discovered in pretty haphazard order

152
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,079
Asador always gaps or holes

153
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
But right now we have a

154
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,663
Full complete and Berry

155
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
Attractive.

156
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,039
So if you like your periodic table squared off in Thai tea

157
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Well this is

158
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
The time to be alive my friend

159
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,903
And given the fact that the

160
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,463
Elements along the very bottom row

161
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,999
Are very fragile

162
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,303
Scientist don't know if they'll be able to

163
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:05,215
Plead the eighth row if that ever gets started to create one or more elements

164
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
To start a new row

165
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,263
Increase accuracy

166
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
The correct word because

167
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Do you bake new elements

168
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,639
Are made by Smashing together other elements in a lab

169
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
The same King doubts that they'll be able to

170
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
Manufacture one that will fit into

171
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,783
Each and every column

172
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,879
So so right now is not only the only time we've ever had a complete

173
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
What it could be

174
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
The only real complete

175
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

189
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,199
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

190
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,551
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

191
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,903
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

192
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
Actually if I'm being honest

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,591
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

198
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,943
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

199
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
Now

200
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,015
I need to clear my name

201
00:08:54,527 --> 00:09:00,415
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
