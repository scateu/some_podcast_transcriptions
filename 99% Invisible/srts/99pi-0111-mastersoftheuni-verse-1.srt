When it comes to sports

38
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,536
The uniforms matter a lot

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,008
Who won the Giant

44
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,288
You know what I mean

45
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
You know what I mean it's different guys every year different guys right teams will move from City

46
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:00,320
The city the players come and go they get traded they retire they leave via free agency

47
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
But you keep

48
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
Rooting for those colors

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
And that logo

50
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
And that uniform

51
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,584
You're rooting for clothes when you get right down to it

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
I want my change clothes to beat the clothes from the Pacific

53
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,104
There's nothing really wrong with that laundry

54
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,760
And the measure of its according to Paul Lucas the creator of uni watch website devoted to the obsessive study of Athletics

56
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Is this

57
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,600
Passionate New York Mets fan

58
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
And I really really hate

59
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
The New York Yankees

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
But if the entire

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,208
Mets team

62
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
25 guys

63
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,536
Is traded even up for the entire Yankee

64
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
25 guys

65
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Today

66
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:50,496
Who do I root for tomorrow and tell me the answer is obvious it's a no-brainer I root for whoever is wearing the Mets uniform

67
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,824
No matter who it is even if it's a bunch of guys who were wearing the Yankees

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
Uniform the day before

69
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,552
To the identities of the players are almost irrelevant is the uniform and that is an unusual

70
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Strong form

71
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
Of brand loyalty

72
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
Because if I like say

73
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
Certain brand of cereal

74
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:16,096
What's that like Cheerios while I identify with the box and the logo and the colors and all that the package design

75
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,888
But I also presumably like the

76
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
The product

77
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,448
And if I

78
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
Find that the quality of the product has changed if it doesn't taste good anymore or if it's some aspect of it. If it doesn't

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
Stay crunchy in milk or whatever

80
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
I may give it one or two more tries based on my my brand loyalty but eventually I will leave that for and I will

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
Banded it if I find the quality is no longer there

82
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
But in sports

83
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
The content of

84
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,976
The product and the quality of that content

85
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
Meeting the players

86
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
Is changing all the time you can be really good one year really bad the next year your roster can turn over so the content of

87
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
The product

88
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
Is constantly in flux

89
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,264
But we stay loyal

90
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,056
To whoever is wearing that uniform

91
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,128
And that is an unusually attempt to my mind it's a unique

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,944
Form of brand loyalty there's nothing else like it

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,224
In our consumer Alliance

94
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:09,600
Like Paul Luke is my friend Jesse Thorn also obsesses over baseball uniforms

95
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
Although he didn't make a career of it

96
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
He has another job

97
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:19,839
I'm Jesse Thorn I'm the owner of Maximum plan.org and the host of the NPR show bullseye

98
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:26,239
There are certain things about a uniform that serve a purpose by being uniform

99
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,079
They help the players identify each other they help us rally behind our team

100
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,871
They give us something cool to buy

101
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,687
But there are certain things on the uniform that aren't uniform

102
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,503
Things that a player can choose

103
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,879
The number of things that a player can choose are very very small I mean it was a big controversy

104
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
When I was

105
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
A kid when Ken Griffey jr.

106
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,023
Shag balls in the Outfield during batting practice

107
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
With his baseball hat on backward

108
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,631
It's a big controversy now when a baseball player

109
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
Where's his

110
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
Cap brim totally flat

111
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
In what you might call the hip hop style

112
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,567
As opposed to curved kind of like

113
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,919
Is that what you mean yeah well I mean that literally make a device that you can

114
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:11,295
Buy at the sporting good store order via mail order that will give you a quote on quote the perfect

115
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
Curve your brim

116
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:16,159
And I I mean I remember as a little Leaguer obsessing over getting the

117
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Brim of my

118
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,535
Hat to curve exactly right and I was not the only one

119
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:29,471
We had Jesse Thorn talk with Paul Lucas I mean you watch any discovered that Paul also zeros in on the settle Express

120
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,543
Tiana baseball players uniform

121
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
I'm always very alert for any glimpse

122
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,919
Of the underside of a players

123
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
Cap Brim

124
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:44,319
Because over the years a color of that element is called be under brim or the under visor

125
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
Has changed when I was a kid they were green and they changed to gray for most teams and now they are mostly

126
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Black

127
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
And some players

128
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
Will write something

129
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
On the under Brim

130
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,983
Fewer players do it now that they're black because you have to use with a white or a silver Sharpie back when they were gray players

131
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,663
And players with ripe unusual things their inspirational messages with a name for their children or whatever the case might be in.

132
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
I always Timmy was an inch

133
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
Startup stealth area

134
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
Of uniform world with a universe

135
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
What to call it

136
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
The other thing

137
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,719
You like that continuity in the universe

138
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
But when you get to baseball uniform aficionados like Paul and Jesse together in conversation there is one area of the

139
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,191
The baseball uniform that they truly get out about

140
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,751
The intersection between the pant leg

141
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
And the sock

142
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
Basically the whole area

143
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
Below the knee

144
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,663
And it's the the least legislated

145
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,503
Least regulated and released uniform

146
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
Part of the uniform

147
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,183
Even though baseball teams have been historically named after the color of their socks there is no rules governing the

148
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,255
The length of the pants or whether or not you will actually see

149
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
And that has really changed

150
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Last generation

151
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
Tickle a lot over

152
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
You know the last century or so

153
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
Early baseball uniforms

154
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,007
Had essentially knickers

155
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
And what do you wear with knickers you wear

156
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Stockings

157
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
And that's what really baseball

158
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,943
And over the course of the 20th century

159
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,527
Those knickers started getting longer and longer and they said

160
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,831
Tripping a little lower a little lower and then

161
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
What's a mid calf

162
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
Pain in lower calf and then

163
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,719
Little lower and now we have so many of the players

164
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
Who wear their pants all the way down

165
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
Are there shoe tops like footie pajamas

166
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,631
And then you have a handful of players like

167
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
Say Alex Rodriguez and

168
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:42,079
Curtis Granderson Ichiro Suzuki Hawaii to hike their pants up high so there are minority but there is a faction of

169
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,127
You do that but there's no uniformity

170
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
And I think it's a shame

171
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
Tragedy

172
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
That we got the

173
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
Is players who wear the

174
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,575
The pants all the way down to the shoe tops because when you cover up the socks

175
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
You're basically dishonoring

176
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
Baseball's hosiery

177
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Heritage

178
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
So let's break it down

179
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,583
Today baseball pants are stretchy polyester they used to be wolf lamp

180
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
So

181
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,399
The pants that they have now

182
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
You can wear them kind of tight or loose

183
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,031
And you can wear your pants at a variety of different lengths

184
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
So

185
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,455
They can go down all the way to the top of your shoes and in fact some players have gone so far as have a strap

186
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:24,063
That goes underneath their shoes to keep it keep from showing any socket all

187
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,135
You can wear your pants up swerve at the bottom of your calves

188
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,999
Which shows a little bit of sock that's probably what most players do and they just kind of let him sit there

189
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,631
You can wear your pants up all the way over your calves

190
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
At the top of your calves

191
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Like they were

192
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,311
You know sporting pants from the early part of the twentieth century you know like they were

193
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
Greek store

194
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Plus user plus

195
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
And if you wear your pants in that style with the bottoms all the way up to your knees you can either wear song

196
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Colored socks

197
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,623
You can wear socks with a stripe up the side

198
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
It's meant to simulate a stirrup socks

199
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,487
Or you can wear actual stirrups

200
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
These choices

201
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:10,143
Stirrup socks are the ultimate in baseball Hosiery for the die-hard old school fans

202
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
If you need help a tree in a stirrup

203
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
They're basically

204
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
Two layers of socks

205
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,055
There's a bottom layer that's a normal Old Sock

206
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,383
There's also an exterior socket that's a different color

207
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
At the bottom of that song

208
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,527
Is just a strap that goes underneath the arch of the players foot

209
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,855
The idea behind stirrups goes back about a century

210
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,183
Baseball pants used to be just knickers and you would wear stockings

211
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,999
With them but in the early days of baseball

212
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:41,119
Baseball is a pretty rough-and-tumble game players with off and get spiked and there were some players like the Great Hall of Fame

213
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
Cycop would famously sharpen their spikes

214
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
So that when they slid into second

215
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
Enter third day stay with

216
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Cut up the infielder

217
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
And if you got spiked in the shin

218
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,151
You get cut in your stockings and

219
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,943
The fabric dyes

220
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
In those days we're not colorfast

221
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
And so if you got spiked

222
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
Die from your stockings could get in the wound

223
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
How to get blood poisoning

224
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Orsova

225
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,207
I don't know if there any documented cases

226
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
Got blood

227
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,071
ISO someone got the idea and we don't know who someone

228
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:16,191
Unisom great hero who deserves a statue or the statue to the great unknown stirrups

229
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
Innovator

230
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
That

231
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
If you

232
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
War on under sock

233
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
An extra layer of sauce

234
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
You would have an extra layer

235
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
Protection of sanitary Ware

236
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,479
What is under sock

237
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Became known as a sanitary

238
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
Aorta pair of socks

239
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
Became known as sanitaries or Sani

240
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
And then

241
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
The / stocking

242
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
Great Wall Beijing one you have to wear

243
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,607
Does the stocking over the under sock because now you be wearing two pairs of socks

244
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Your shoes wouldn't

245
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,191
And so they decided to

246
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Cutout

247
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
The foot area

248
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
The Overstock

249
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:57,919
And creative Little Stirrup opening and that's how baseball stirrups were born and originally

250
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
That opening with

251
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
Tiny was just enough for your foot to fit

252
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
And almost immediately

253
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Players began

254
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
Pulling it and stretching it higher

255
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
And so

256
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,719
More and more of an opening appeared and Mattox

257
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,791
Exposed more and more of the sanitary under sock with

258
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
Usually White

259
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,887
So you started having the sort of interplay of color

260
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,703
Of the ever-widening opening up the colored stirrup

261
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,287
And white Under sock and by the 1960s they were players

262
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
Like Frank Robinson

263
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
Baltimore Orioles

264
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
Who are actually

265
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Cutting

266
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
The bottom part of the Stirrup the park

267
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
The loop under your foot

268
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
And adding more fabric to it

269
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:38,879
So that they could pull their stirrups even higher higher than the manufacturer head-to-head intended

270
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,743
Well Service may have had this functional origin they quickly lost that

271
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,583
And they just became incorporated into the visual language of baseball

272
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,143
I think from many people myself included

273
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
It's what we think of

274
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
When we think

275
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:57,311
Pick up a baseball player it's interesting to note that in the pages of the New Yorker

276
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Weekly Magazine

277
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
They run a lot of

278
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,431
Cartoons that are a baseball team

279
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
And they're cartoonist

280
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
Almost invariably

281
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:10,367
To pick baseball players wearing stirrups even though most actual baseball players today

282
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Do not wear

283
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
I played in

284
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
Kids baseball league and

285
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,815
I remember how official seeming

286
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,887
And functional Stirrup seem to be

287
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,287
Despite the fact that you know with contemporary soft technology they are rendered essentially function with

288
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,639
But it seems that the romance is gone by the time you get to the big leagues

289
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,711
Shadowsocks

290
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,551
Why do you wear your pants down and in the answer I often get is

291
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
It's just so much less work

292
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,647
You know if you leave your pants any shoot oxy.

293
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Leaf blower maintenance

294
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
Essentially

295
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
You don't have to worry about your socks be

296
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,071
You don't have to worry that your stirrups are both started at the exact same

297
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
Hi Tor level

298
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,191
You don't have to keep looking and checking to make sure that they're just so

299
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
Just like most of us know when we walk around with

300
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,031
Get out slacks or jeans or whatever

301
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:04,383
Pants that you wear your pants love you really have to worry about what's going on underneath them

302
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,455
And so it's it's just easier and I understand

303
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,295
If there's a villain in the story of baseball hosiery

304
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
That role would be filled by George Hendrick

305
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:20,255
Who played for the Cardinals and A's and some other teams in the 70s and 80s he's now the first base coach of the Tampa Bay Rays

306
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,815
He's the one that's most often credited or blamed

307
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,143
As the most influential player in the move towards long pants

308
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
And he White

309
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,215
To wear his pants down

310
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:35,615
Toward his ankle which by today's standards is pretty tame but by the standards of the year he played in

311
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
Wisin is radical

312
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,479
He showed very very little of his socks are stirrups and

313
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
Some people thought it were

314
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Weird

315
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:48,159
Dumpy your dignified or whatever but there were other players who thought it look

316
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,719
Different and therefore Innovative and therefore

317
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Cool

318
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,863
What major league baseball players

319
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,911
As sock style do you most admire

320
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:06,079
At this point I mean it's pretty Slim Chickens In terms of Hosiery Heroes nowadays because there aren't

321
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,871
Many players who wear stirrups

322
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,943
Begin with N and even fewer who wear stirrups

323
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
The way I like to

324
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
I like the style I like

325
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,575
The best I would say is a pitcher named Josh

326
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Outman

327
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,391
Which is a great name for baseball right out now

328
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
He's a picture

329
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Fires out

330
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,535
Where's a real 1970

331
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Freestyle stirrups

332
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
I love

333
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
What about the people don't

334
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
How much but he's number one

335
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Reed Johnson

336
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,311
Who's an outfielder you wear Stirrups in a not too shabby way

337
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,639
But the fact that I have to search my

338
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
Medical database

339
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
To come up with three or four players

340
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
It's just not that great interns

341
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,295
It starts now there are other players who do

342
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
Hike their pants up high and just

343
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,927
Wear solid color socks and and do so pretty nicely

344
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
Play Curtis Granderson

345
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,999
He looks great in uniform

346
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,815
Stephen Strasburg of the Washington Nationals

347
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
What's the young Phenom pitcher

348
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
Does something great called blousing

349
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Is he doesn't just hike

350
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Pants up butt

351
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Stocks under the

352
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
The cop in a way where it just sort of

353
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
Blouses out a little bit

354
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
Sit under

355
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,687
Instead of just watching them up the way Alex Rodriguez does for example

356
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
And that sort of a lost art

357
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
Clausen Jim Thome

358
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
Retired Slugger

359
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Play from any team

360
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Great great browser

361
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
All-time browser

362
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
So

363
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
There are lots of little elements here

364
