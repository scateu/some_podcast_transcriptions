I'm Roman Mars

27
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,024
Imagine you're in a hospital room

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,328
Waiting to hear the results of a test you at

29
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
The doctor comes in

30
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
Apps

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,432
You might Sense on some level what's about to happen

32
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
I got the results back

33
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,208
The muscles in your shoulders tense up

34
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
Your hand suddenly feel clammy

35
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,816
They found a mass in your descending colon

36
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
Biopsy

37
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
I see if it's positive

38
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,360
And then you get some very bad news

39
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,456
Results came back that is invasive adenocarcinoma

40
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504
And what that means

41
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,904
The cancer is basically untreatable

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,576
Then after about 10 minutes a timer goes off

43
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
And the encounter is over

44
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,008
Okay when take a deep breath

45
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,336
That was not actually somebody being told they had terminal cancer

46
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,944
It was part of an exam for Med students at Rush Medical College in Chicago

47
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,016
I do remember that student and I thought he did a really really nice

48
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
PetSmart para who played the patient he went the whole day being told by medical students that he was dying and then

49
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,000
Henry acting as if that was actually happening

50
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
Is CS difficult it's a it's a long day

51
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
About a long day

52
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
The little Like A demented theme park

53
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,192
Job

54
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:57,824
But as difficult as it is Mark is playing an important role for Med students like Rd Missouri

55
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,432
It's never a good feeling to break bad news to patients but I understand that

56
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,040
No matter which field I go into or which specialty of this is something that we all will have to

57
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Andorra some point

58
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
In medicine bad news is defined as any information that drastically and negatively Alters a patient

59
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Outlook for the future

60
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,351
John Cecile is a radio reporter and part-time Medical School videographer

61
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,751
TXU set up cameras to film that encounter between Mark and Hardy so that RT could be evaluated

62
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
On his communication skills

63
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,895
And I was really surprised by how calm and compassionate already was

64
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,711
Many doctors struggle with Breaking Bad News

65
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,087
I've heard stories about a doctor leaving a voicemail to tell a patient she have cancer

66
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,719
I heard another story about a doctor who used a sports analogy to deliver difficult information

67
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,815
As in it's the bottom of the ninth and there's one out left

68
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
Breaking bad news is as delicate a procedure as a knee surgery and there can be serious consequences if they

69
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
Things go wrong

70
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,823
If the patient doesn't understand their diagnosis or

71
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
What the next steps are

72
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,687
They could end up making an informed decisions about their treatment

73
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,759
Which is why many medical schools now offer training

74
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
They bring an actor's to help

75
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,599
Students learn how to navigate this

76
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,415
Critically important and very high-stakes moment

77
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,975
A moment that most of us will experience

78
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
One way or another

79
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,887
But that's not the only connection between acting and this particular facet of Medicine

80
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:31,775
Goodbye

81
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,895
It turns out one of the first doctors to recognize this problem

82
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
He wasn't just a physician

83
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
There's also a comedian

84
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
And he actually Drew an attic

85
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,855
Experience to transform the way that doctors break bad news

86
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,207
There are ways of doing this they're always of Breaking Bad News

87
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
His name was Rob Buckman

88
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:59,167
And his very unusual life prepared him perfectly to tackle what might be the hardest part

89
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
Of a very hard job

90
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,871
In 1968 Rob Buckman was on stage in London's West End

91
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
Striptease

92
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
I think the essence of it is that it was a

93
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,855
The strip routine that you might have expected a female burlesque.

94
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,463
To come out and do with rub it in this extraordinarily physically unlikely

95
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Guys

96
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
Going through all sorts of

97
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,351
Gestures getting his head stuck in his

98
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,399
Pullover

99
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,263
This is Pete Atkin and Russell Davies

100
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Two of Rob's best friend

101
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,615
They were all students together at Cambridge University

102
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,919
And they were all members of the footlight

103
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
A theatrical Club

104
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,039
It was a big deal to be in the Footlights then and it still is today

105
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,439
The group has turned out tons of famous comedians like half the comedy troupe Monty Python and more recently peep

106
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
People like John Oliver

107
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,559
The Footlights put on reviews each year that featured comedy and music

108
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
And back in the late 60s

109
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
Rob strip routine was a highlight

110
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
He did

111
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Take it

112
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,495
Absolutely seriously hate

113
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
Came out and did it as if

114
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
People were meant to be

115
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
Aroused by this routine

116
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,967
Play with your moving as watched as if this was especially in Russia

117
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,015
Ocala FL

118
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,087
Except taking off your watch like will do

119
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
There was no real punchline to it was there except

120
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,511
Except that he had a flower painted on his stomach

121
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
And that was robbed that.

122
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,471
Robert going to Cambridge with the intention of becoming a doctor

123
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,799
My day he said he medicine and two classes in Biochemistry

124
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,383
By night he wrote and performed sketches in the Footlights Club room

125
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,199
House in the second story of a local fish shop

126
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
He slept only three or four hours a night

127
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,831
After Cambridge Rob went to a teaching Hospital

128
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,207
And it turns out that he answered medicine just as a big shift in medical culture was happen

129
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,791
One that changed the way doctors thought about their patient

130
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:09,215
Around the same time Rob was on stage in London West End doing a strip routine

131
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,823
His name dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross was working on a pretty radical project

132
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:18,431
She was spending time with dying patients at a hospital in Chicago

133
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
Listening to their stories

134
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,295
I just sent them listen to dying patients

135
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,855
I'm try to be their spokesman

136
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,927
You can only sit and listen and hear

137
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
What they say

138
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,535
They teach you nothing about dying but about living

139
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,935
In 1969 Kubler-Ross published a book based on her research called on death and dying

140
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
You know the five stages of grief

141
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
That's where that come

142
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,895
The book became an international bestseller and brought conversations about dying into the home

143
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:54,527
Google Ross also encourage doctors to speak more frankly with their patients about death

144
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,855
She said they needed to stop tiptoeing around the subject

145
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,951
Which is what doctors had done for most of the history of modern medicine

146
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,095
The original code of ethics established by the American Medical Association in 1847 sed

147
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,655
It wasn't the role of doctors to make

148
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Quote

149
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959
Gloomy prognostication

150
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,823
Instead they should be Ministers of Hope and comfort

151
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,943
Doctors were afraid that disclosing a bad diagnosis would actually be damaging

152
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
They could even drive patients to suicide

153
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,575
This attitude remained unchanged through much of the 20th century

154
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,903
In the fifties the word cancer wasn't used

155
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,047
Dr. Walter Bell is a psychiatrist and a professor at the MD Anderson Cancer Center

156
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,863
It's part of the University of Texas in Houston

157
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,447
There was a lot of deception that went on around

158
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
How sick people really were

159
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,311
You couldn't talk about the patient died so you can imagine

160
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
Nobody

161
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,127
Really was able to say goodbye

162
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:59,039
In 1951 the Journal of the American Medical Association actually published methods for deceiving cancer pain

163
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
Patients and their families

164
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:05,183
They recommended giving evasive answers or using confusing euphemisms

165
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,975
Like calling cancer and ulcer

166
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
Or an infection

167
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,655
The same article recommended that cancer patients who learn the truth of their diagnosis and reacted badly to it

168
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
Be given lobotomies

169
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
And this attitude was

170
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
Pervasive

171
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,919
In 1961 a survey showed that 90% of doctors prefer not to disclose

172
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,711
Cancer diagnosis the patients

173
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:33,087
Despite another study showing that the vast majority of patients wanted to know the truth

174
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,647
But then things started to change

175
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,231
In the 1960s doctors develop effective treatments for cancer

176
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,815
The two big advancements for chemotherapy and radiation therapy

177
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
The

178
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
Research just exploded

179
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,727
Patients have a lot more to hope for

180
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,847
And around the same time palliative care emerged as a concept in medicine

181
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
We began to

182
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
Realize that

183
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,991
Controlling pain and other symptoms

184
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,295
Could give people a peaceful death

185
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,903
The modern palliative care movement together with hospice

186
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
Has

187
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,975
Really made death

188
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Less fearful

189
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
4 people

190
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:21,727
These developments along with the work of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross all started to change the way our culture talked about death and

191
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
Dying

192
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
And it was in this context

193
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
That Rob Buckman became a doctor

194
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,663
A Doctor Who's totally irreverent take on medicine

195
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,479
Would ultimately help him transform the field

196
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,463
Rob's work in the Cambridge Footlights got him noticed by the BBC

197
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,071
Was still training at the doctor he wrote and performed on radio and TV

198
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,191
In 1978 he and his writing partner or given their own comedy program

199
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
It was called

200
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,007
The pink Medicine Show

201
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,223
I think medicine show was like SNL or Mad TV but all medical

202
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,807
It was actually a lot of comedy about medicine at this time

203
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
Especially in Britain

204
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:15,487
Doctors were seen as the stodgy and distant authority figures so they made a good Target for satire

205
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,815
One of Rob's recurring characters on the show was a malingerer

206
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
A guy pretending to be sick

207
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,703
Who keeps showing up at the hospital with different ridiculous excuses

208
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
It's a bat mug

209
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Bowels

210
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
What's the regular

211
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,367
Every morning

212
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,159
I don't wake up till 9

213
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,023
Rob success caught the attention of another Footlights alone

214
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,839
Mostly we lost a lot because he was funny

215
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
We was one of the

216
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,703
Half dozen people that I spend most of my time laughing

217
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
That's John Cleese

218
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,311
You know Monty Python Fawlty Towers

219
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
A Fish Called Wanda the James Bond movies

220
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,247
I think he's in one of the Harry Potters anyway when I reached him he was getting ready to go on Safari

221
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
Well I'm off tomorrow for 3 and 1/2 months

222
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,415
Simon the usual stage of wondering what I forgotten to pack

223
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,279
In 1979 John Cleese was producing the secret policeman's ball

224
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,095
A comedy show that benefited Amnesty International

225
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,679
Any ask Rob if he'd appear in a sketch with him and Michael Palin

226
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
The old Monty Python been known as

227
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
The Cheese Shop sketch

228
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,943
How about it

229
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,135
Yes it's a very silly python sketch in which a man goes into a cheese shop

230
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,743
To buy some cheese and it slowly becomes obvious

231
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
That they don't actually have any

232
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
Any cheese in the shop

233
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
Parmesan

234
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,751
As the man puts

235
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,079
Seems to be shopping toddy uncontaminated by cheese

236
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,575
The whole time this ridiculous exchange is taking place

237
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,903
A Greek Bouzouki band is playing in the background of the

238
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,231
The shop and there are two guys doing a weird dance

239
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,535
With their arms around each other shoulder

240
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
One of those guys

241
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Was Rob

242
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,423
And there's a certain point my character goat soap

243
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,239
Irritated by the lack of cheese

244
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
The tide turned Snapchat

245
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,663
At the Greek goddesses

246
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
Then stopped in slang.

247
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,111
Rob's appearance with Monty Python mark one of the high points of his comedy career

248
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,951
If you look close that you might notice his face looks pale

249
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
A little puffy

250
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,071
That's because after finishing his medical training and establishing himself the comedy

251
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Rob

252
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Country Way

253
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
Really sick

254
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,007
Soon firsthand what it was like to be a dying patient

255
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
And this role reversal

256
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
From Doctor to

257
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
Stick person

258
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,175
Would transform how he thought about his work as a physician

259
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,479
And the process of Breaking Bad News

260
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,039
April 1978

261
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,135
I contracted a very interesting and very rare disease

262
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
Interesting not just

263
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,487
Because he defected me and turned me from

264
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
A doctor into a page

265
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,351
But also because it's one of a group of disease

266
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
In which

267
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
The body's defense

268
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
The body itself

269
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
And in which you become

270
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Literally

271
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
Euro

272
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
That's Rob

273
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,431
From a TV documentary he made about his illness

274
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
As he was becoming sicker

275
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,527
It's called Your Own Worst Enemy

276
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
It began

277
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,855
Very simply and very mildly

278
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
With pain

279
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
In my right wrist

280
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,207
And when I move my wrist

281
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
It Creek

282
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
Rob had dermatomyositis

283
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,351
Very rare autoimmune disease

284
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,447
The disease causes your body to malfunction and attack its own muscle

285
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
The Robb wasted away

286
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
He developed these rashes all over

287
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
His body

288
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,383
At one point I couldn't actually put my hands behind my head

289
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,711
Because so much of the skin was inflamed it was like wearing

290
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,271
A leather jacket that have been shrunk in them to you

291
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
Encased in

292
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,367
Rob was married at this point and had two daughters

293
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,975
One of the more poignant moments of the film captures Rob trying and failing

294
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
To pick up one of his girls

295
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,815
He talks about how weak and vulnerable

296
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
Bully fails what happens

297
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,631
Is very very simply

298
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,655
The color

299
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
Trains out of everything

300
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
It's the same scene

301
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,287
It's the same family as the same house

302
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
But

303
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
The color the things you enjoy

304
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
Have simply

305
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
Play the tone

306
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,247
All film is about the

307
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,367
While Rob condition was so bad that his doctors thought he might not make it

308
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,951
And the experience of being that close to death was profound

309
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:07,071
Years later he broke all and especially important encounter with one of his Physicians

310
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,863
And I was sitting on my way

311
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,471
Very altruistic and I had all kinds of problems with the skin and bowel trouble

312
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
And I was feeling lousy

313
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,103
He said you got miss you girl. You go the other you look skinny but the muscles

314
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
It must be awful for you

315
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
I am sorry

316
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
It must be awful

317
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Fall for you

318
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
I'm sorry

319
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,087
I very nearly burst into tears and hugged it

320
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
Because he gave me

321
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
Permission to feel

322
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,535
The doctor was telling Rob that it was okay to have feelings about being sick

323
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,119
But the negative emotions were a valid part of the experience

324
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,447
The doctor was paying attention not just to Robbins physical state

325
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,751
But also his emotional state

326
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
And while this might seem obvious

327
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,871
It wasn't especially common for doctors to

328
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
To do this back then

329
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,967
This moment was simple but important

330
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,295
It would go on to become the Cornerstone of Rob's approach

331
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
The doctor-patient communication

332
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,511
And then little by little

333
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
Rob started getting better

334
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,119
He was having blood plasma replacement therapy

335
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,679
And a new drug he was taking started to work

336
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
The last 4 weeks

337
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Something like

338
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
I can drive my car

339
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
I can

340
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
Straighten my elbows

341
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:29,247
I can dress myself I can put any kind of sucks on even really sucks by May of 1980 Rob's condition had

342
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
I turned around

343
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:35,391
I can go for walks in the park with the kids and don't feel too bad about it and I can stay awake all day

344
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:40,767
I watch television in the evening or whatever like go to bed at midnight and then live

345
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,471
Normal life Med going back is incredibly intense work schedule

346
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,615
He was more successful than ever training as a specialist in oncology which is the branch of medicine that deals with cancer

347
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,967
While simultaneously co-hosting a popular TV science show called

348
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
Where there's life

349
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:07,391
Where there's life returns as doctors Miriam stoppard and Rob Buckman explore such topics as cosmetic surgery

350
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
Unwed mothers and the nursing

351
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,255
But that intensity wasn't good for his marriage

352
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,351
He and his wife ended up getting a divorce and in 1985

353
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,887
Rob move to Toronto

354
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
To take a job at a hospital

355
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,007
In Canada ROM had to restart his life completely

356
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,127
It was there he would end up making his most lasting contributions to the field of Medicine

357
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,735
He started studying the way that doctors communicated with people they were treating

358
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
Specifically

359
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
He was interested in how doctors interact

360
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
Dying patient

361
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,183
Because he himself had recently been a dying patient

362
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,255
This is from an interview he gave in 1999

363
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,559
The great thing about

364
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,863
Being able from my point of view

365
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,727
Was that I found out that I could tolerate mean I did

366
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
But I didn't come

367
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,103
I didn't have my hero by any means but I wasn't a different person

368
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:07,039
His big realization was that doctors didn't need to hide information from their patients and tiptoe through tough subject

369
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,599
Sick people could withstand a lot

370
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,135
So when I recovered

371
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,463
I was thin able to say okay I've been on the phone

372
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
And I stayed the same

373
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,815
No I can be brave when talking to the patient

374
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
He walked in my room like

375
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
A breath of

376
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,495
Not fresh air I was sort of like a

377
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
Wind

378
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,311
Is huge energy

379
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,383
Exploding into the room and I've never actually

380
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
Met anybody quite like him before

381
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
I think most people haven't

382
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,647
Dr. Patricia Shaw was a cancer researcher at the same hospital where Rob worked in Toronto

383
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
She goes by Pat

384
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:51,327
Patton Robinette in the most dr.lee meet-cute scenario imaginable

385
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
Why didn't you ask me

386
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Crisco

387
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
And so we came into

388
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Kisimi

389
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
And that's how we really

390
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
That's our first conversation

391
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,103
One thing led to another and they got married in 1988

392
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,663
It was around this time that Rob started writing more

393
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,967
He had a large piece of

394
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
Solid mahogany

395
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,063
They brought with them from England

396
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
And

397
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,647
His favorite spot was just sit at this desk

398
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Cache of computer

399
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,744
So even though he's really busy

400
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
At the hospital

401
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,328
He's been a huge amount of time

402
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
After those hours

403
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,888
Working in a study

404
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
Rob wrote a book

405
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,216
Called I don't know what to say

406
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,288
How to help and support someone who is dying

407
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,104
It's kind of like What to Expect When You're Expecting

408
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:39,200
If what you're expecting is that somebody close to you is going to die

409
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,064
It's a very Frank but easy to read book that covers everything from

410
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,160
Basic listening skills to the sexual needs of the dying to survivor's guilt

411
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
And then in 1992

412
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,536
Rob published the most important book of his career

413
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
It was titled

414
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
How to break bad news

415
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
The first medical textbook

416
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
On the subject

417
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
When Rob Buckman

418
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,288
Wrote the book on how to get bad news it was from his

419
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,128
Experience as an oncologist having to give it

420
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
Several times a week

421
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,480
That's dr. Walter Bale again

422
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:16,320
He was also studying doctor-patient communication when Rob's book came out

423
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
He understood that

424
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,952
Bad news was a series of steps that could be broken down into series of steps

425
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:27,072
Walter and Rob would eventually write a set of guidelines based on route

426
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
Book

427
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,376
They called their strategy

428
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
The spikes protocol

429
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
Spike's was an acronym

430
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,984
That's good for setting

431
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,776
Reception invitation

432
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Knowledge

433
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
Emotions

434
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,848
Stratagene summary

435
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:43,456
It's a mnemonic device that doctors can use as they prepare to give bad news

436
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,528
And then during the actual conversation with the patient

437
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
So that it doesn't

438
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
Fly off the rails

439
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,904
Eden worried that it was sounded too I don't know Spike

440
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,720
We didn't even

441
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,024
Think about it because it was so elegant

442
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
Everybody remembers that

443
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:04,448
Soon Walter and Rob were giving presentations on spikes at hospitals all over the world

444
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,848
They made videos for medical schools which demonstrated have spikes could help doctors navigate these difficult conversations

445
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
And some of the videos robbed

446
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
Performs improvised scenes with actors

447
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,224
Explain patience or family member

448
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,552
Just like you heard already doing with Mark at the beginning of this episode

449
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
Not real but

450
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Really intense

451
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,416
Here is the six

452
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Step protocol

453
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,232
Which has the robbery in Allegan

454
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
Threatening acronym

455
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
Texas stencil

456
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
Getting the physical context write

457
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,008
Sit down relax

458
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
Eye contact

459
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:45,408
If the patient is either angry or crying

460
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,456
Wright-Patt perception

461
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,992
Assessing the patient

462
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,320
Perception of his or her medical

463
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
When you got back chest

464
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
When you found that lump in your breast

465
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
What did you think

466
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Quiz

467
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,768
Then comes the pivot of the whole interview

468
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
When you ask

469
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
The patient

470
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,376
What he or she would like

471
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
I

472
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:13,568
Invitation you want to know the exact results of the bones kind of know what is going on is that the kind of

473
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,128
Where you'd like me to handle the information please

474
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
Giving the medical facts

475
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,528
Belk Wilson

476
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,344
Cumberland microscope

477
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,648
I can't tell you what it wants

478
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,696
Give me information in small chunks

479
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,488
Whois check

480
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,816
That the patient understand what you are saying

481
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:39,424
After each small chunk of the girls was malignant

482
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
In other words of the law

483
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
I have cancer in my lung

484
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
4 ml

485
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
Acknowledge

486
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,712
Name the emotion

487
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
But the patient is expressing

488
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,392
If this is obviously a great shock to this is difficult this must make you feel overwhelmed

489
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:03,232
Your ability to empathize with the patients emotion

490
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,072
Is the single most important characteristic

491
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
A good

492
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,144
And supportive newsbreak

493
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
Insensate

494
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Indivisible

495
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
And then

496
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
S

497
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,336
Strategy and summary

498
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,128
Why we do from here

499
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,200
What we do from here this is very important

500
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,528
Whatever it is that's going to happen next

501
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Make It Clap

502
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,952
As you can hear from those scenes Rob with master

503
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
Breaking Bad News

504
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
He was calm

505
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,584
Present compassionate and clear

506
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,912
And not just because he been a patient

507
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704
But because he been a comedian

508
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,544
It's the ability to put yourself in your audience's shoes

509
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
And understand

510
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
What makes them

511
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,688
Check right so if you're comedian

512
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,968
You want to know

513
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
What you can do

514
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
To make people laugh right

515
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
If you're a doctor

516
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
You need to put yourself

517
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
In people shoes

518
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,976
And imagine what they need

519
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,792
In order to make sense out of

520
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,584
The process of giving bad news

521
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,168
Even though Rob had recovered from his illness

522
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:19,520
It has taken a toll on his body and he had health problems for the rest of his life

523
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,360
A case of shingles left him paralyzed on one side

524
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,920
Your difficulty dressing himself in Wok

525
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
He couldn't drive a car

526
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
And that was

527
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
Pretty devastating

528
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
Again Rob's wife

529
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,952
This insult leaving him with his permanent episode I think was

530
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,792
Really really damaging any other hard time coping with that

531
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,912
But in his typical robway he kept working on his many projects

532
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:51,520
In 2011 he flew to London to film a series of health videos with Terry Jones

533
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,824
Another member of Monty Python

534
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,896
Then he got back on the plane to Toronto

535
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,688
Afters light Garden

536
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
You didn't arrive any wasn't answering his

537
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
Text messages

538
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,344
Wasn't too unusual he's travel so much flights

539
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
. delayed

540
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,904
I went to bed

541
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,464
Panda boat midnight

542
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,048
There is a knock on the door and there was a policeman at the

543
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
At the door

544
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,144
Doctors aren't the only ones who have to break bad news

545
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,240
Talk to bit of nonsense and then asked if I was

546
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288
Mrs. Pacman

547
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,640
And then eventually got caught around saying that the prophet passed away

548
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:33,760
Robert died in his sleep on the plane from an undiagnosed heart condition

549
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
He was only 63

550
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,368
It took Pat a long time to get over the shock

551
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
There was

552
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,184
So much boo

553
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,584
Missing Rob there is so much about having to deal with the realities of what happens when somebody dies

554
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,936
And even though Raab himself had talked openly about death and dying

555
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:56,288
Even though he'd spent years writing books that encourage people to be frank about the

556
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
These subjects

557
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,872
He wasn't actually ready for his own death

558
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:04,992
In real terms you know like finance and insurance and all that kind of stuff

559
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
What was there was hard

560
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,368
Even though it's 6 years later and it still makes me

561
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,976
Bacteria thinking about it

562
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,328
Beyond Rob's death

563
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
Spike's has endured

564
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,192
It's been absorbed into the mainstream of American Medicine

565
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:30,848
Just recently the American Society of clinical oncology started recommending that doctors use a protocol

566
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
Call when giving bad news

567
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
Therefore spikes is a good example

568
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,272
And spikes is taught in many medical schools in the US and Canada

569
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
As well as schools in Europe

570
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
Asia and South America

571
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,184
You remember Artie the medical scene from top of the show

572
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,512
He has spikes navigate his encounter with Mark the actor

573
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:55,168
Yeah I think if I hadn't had this beforehand I would have been

574
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,216
Completely lost I would not have known

575
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
Can I where to go next

576
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:06,176
Spike's isn't the only set of guidelines for Breaking Bad news and it may not apply to every bad news situation

577
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,992
In some scenarios like an emergency room

578
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,576
Doctors might not have the time to be that delicate

579
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:18,208
And time is one of the main things working against doctor's as they try to do their jobs

580
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488
Thoroughly and compassion

581
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,328
These days the average physician visit last

582
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
About 21 minutes

583
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,656
More than half of visits last

584
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
15 minutes

585
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Charles S

586
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:32,544
It can be really stressful to try to convey necessary information in that amount

587
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Time

588
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,128
Especially if somebody is freaking out because you know

589
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
They're dying

590
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:43,808
And throughout the course of their careers many doctors will have to break bad news over and over and over again

591
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,112
It's emotionally exhausting

592
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,464
Spike's helps doctors do what they need to do in the limited time they have

593
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,840
It turns the awful task of Breaking Bad News into a clear and simple set of steps

594
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
What it really is

595
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,960
Is a protocol that can help doctors be more like Rob

596
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,752
At least the person he tried to be

597
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,544
Open honest

598
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,312
An empathetic

599
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
Cheers John Cleese

600
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,152
I think it takes empathy

601
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,968
How can you talk to someone

602
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:17,600
Whether it's a group of people or a single person how can you talk to them if you don't have

603
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,160
Lymphocytic feeling of Bay City

604
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
Who they are

605
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,024
What they know already and what they need to know

606
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,608
Rob's funeral was held in Toronto

607
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,680
The same Minister who married Robin Pat leather

608
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
Honda service

609
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,240
Before Rob died

610
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,824
He requested that this song be played as people exited

611
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,920
What a day for a Daydream

612
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,856
I want to record a message

613
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,136
Which is played

614
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,928
Ask the people are leaving

615
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
It's just me and I got to say

616
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,768
Thank you so much for coming

617
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,072
Unlike the rest of you

618
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,632
I don't have to get up in the morning

619
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:08,288
I'm going to

620
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,968
That message wasn't actually played at Rob's funeral even though he choked that he wanted to be

621
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,552
But you'll hear more from Rob and from Monty Python's John Cleese

622
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
Right after this

623
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:32,352
Between the beeps bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made

624
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
Sound

625
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:39,776
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis talking to me in my

626
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:44,384
Wife isn't another room in a kid is in another room and we're all hearing that voice

627
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,176
Technology talk to us

628
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,480
It is a creation of Sonic trash

629
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:55,136
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

630
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,928
To make them more human

631
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,024
Turn the living room lights on

632
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
Okay

633
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,120
Dim the living room lights to 50%

634
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
Okay

635
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:13,568
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

636
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,384
Makes for a much more natural experience

637
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,432
Turn the living room lights on

638
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
Dim the living room lights to 50

639
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
2%

640
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:29,952
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

641
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,024
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

642
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,328
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

643
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,400
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

644
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
Right here

645
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,448
Npip

646
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:49,152
We need to talk about something constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad

647
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:55,552
You take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating but doesn't have to Define you

648
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:01,952
If your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why and it may be time

649
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,976
Nancy kulp

650
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,048
Go to oh my God. Infos Life podcast

651
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:12,448
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast oh my God.

652
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
Flat pocket

653
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,360
So I'm back to the reporter John Basile to talk about some of the remarkable

654
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:24,224
Beautiful pretty much unseen comedy that he found while he was reporting on Rob Buckman

655
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,296
But we can fit into the new story itself so

656
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,856
Is a little extra bit for you Monty Python fans

657
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,208
So are you a Monty Python fan

658
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
I would say it went to a Monty Python face

659
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:40,608
Efface in junior high

660
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,912
You find them and you think

661
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:47,776
I'm really special for liking this when no one else liked it cuz it was just on PBS

662
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,848
Add that was my face why I watched all of them and

663
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:54,432
I love them but I haven't kept my Phantom alive

664
00:33:54,688 --> 00:34:00,832
I'm a huge Monty Python fan and when I started reporting the story had no idea there was any connection between Robin

665
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,112
Monty Python so

666
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,672
Finding that out was like a big deal

667
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,536
Found all this rare stuff

668
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:15,936
That hardly anybody has seen like stuff I got from tapes that Rob's Widow pulled out of storage

669
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:22,592
Like Mike what would give me example so right around the time Rob was writing how to break bad news in the early night

670
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
90s

671
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:27,968
John Cleese got in touch with him and he had this idea for a series called videos for page

672
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:32,320
I said it always seemed to me that it would be a very good idea to make

673
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:38,208
Videos for people who had just being told by the GP

674
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,864
That they had some sort of medical problem because when you told that you always get anxious and then

675
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,656
Absolutely the worst time

676
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,704
To take in information

677
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,104
The idea was to make a bunch of videos describing various medical conditions in detail so that patients with

678
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,688
Weather conditions could replay them whenever they needed a refresher

679
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,760
And almost all of them start with this little sketch that kind of

680
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,808
Deuce Breaking Bad News

681
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,112
And some very beautiful music

682
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:13,792
90s CD-ROM music

683
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,728
Or I don't owe

684
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:25,056
What's my problem leg ulcers

685
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Leg

686
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:34,016
Chris plays a patient inquiring about his condition and Rob the doctor precedes to lay some head

687
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,552
Heavy medical jargon on him

688
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,648
What exactly are leg

689
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,000
Is the consequence of tissue hypoxia

690
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,024
Ischemia

691
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Stacy

692
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Evidence

693
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,144
Proximal varicosities and incompetent

694
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,680
Cost you loitering

695
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
This food

696
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:59,104
So as Rob's talking

697
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,456
Increasingly confused and upset leans in

698
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
Squints looks over his shoulder

699
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,136
By the time the camera lens and close up his face is slack and his eyes are wide with Terror

700
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
Are there any questions

701
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
Naruto

702
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
Yep

703
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
Then I'll see you in

704
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:31,104
Bye-bye bye-bye then please gets up and walks off stage revealing to the audience that he's on a set

705
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,128
Hasn't happened

706
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,176
I haven't

707
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,992
Dr. Tisdale

708
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,528
Really told me that

709
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,344
Sometimes it can feel a bit

710
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
The time I get home

711
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,208
I always realize that I haven't

712
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,232
List of everything that the

713
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
Always something

714
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
I should have asked

715
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
For some reason didn't

716
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
And that's

717
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Exactly

718
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,704
Why we've made this

719
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:03,104
So then the rest of the video is just Rob going over the conditions slowly and in painstaking.

720
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,872
Detail

721
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,688
Lego Elsa is what happened

722
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,224
When the skin

723
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,040
Over a part of your leg count Grove

724
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:16,672
They made almost 50 these videos on everything from breast cancer to something called

725
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,232
Glue ear which I've never heard of

726
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,024
But they ran into a problem

727
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:29,216
A major problem which none of us had anticipated and I'm not entirely sure no one could have anticipated

728
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:33,568
And what was the problem

729
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,872
We set up all sorts of schemes

730
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:41,760
Couldn't pretty shift that we could never find a way of getting people to give us

731
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,552
12 of 13 quid

732
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
4

733
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,880
But 25

734
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Minutes

735
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
Lecture

736
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
People

737
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,976
What's the pay

738
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,768
So that's why you never seen them

739
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,584
But now you can see them on our website

740
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:59,424
Yes you can you can see one of those videos and can also see

741
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,472
Footage of Rob's

742
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,776
Strip routine from the Footlights days

743
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,080
And stuff

744
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:12,480
Right so Rob Buckman also work as a videos with another member of Monty Python the Terry Jones can you tell me a little bit of

745
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
About those

746
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:20,160
It was literally the last thing he ever did he died on the plane on the way back from working with Terry and London

747
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:25,280
And these videos you can see online already there called the top 10 tips for health

748
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:30,400
The goal was to provide practical tips for staying healthy although really

749
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:35,008
When you're watching it just feels like you're watching two old men Goof Off

750
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,312
Here's Robin Terry in Drag

751
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
2 old ladies

752
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:44,480
Actual law.

753
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,760
No ice

754
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,296
Straight off the wall

755
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,368
Did you recognize the spam lady voice roaming

756
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,672
This reminds me of one of my favorite sketches

757
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
Michele watches

758
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:04,448
Piston engine what you thought that's what it was about

759
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,104
That one I know by heart that was good

760
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
Video series they actually

761
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,456
Directly make fun of Breaking Bad News

762
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,272
Type 2 diabetes

763
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
Nice

764
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
I said

765
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,672
Buhach

766
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,464
Type 2 diabetes

767
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Is the Robins

768
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,608
I think I saw in the cinema the other day

769
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,424
At the diabetes 2

770
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:41,568
The Terry Jones is still alive but unfortunately he's suffering from dementia so we were able to interview on

771
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,200
He dropped a really close though Terry actually wrote Rob's obituary in the guardian after

772
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
He died

773
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,528
I remember when you're putting the story together

774
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:56,928
When you got the interview with John Cleese I was just shocked that he was to be that he talked to you

775
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,720
How hard was that to to manage

776
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:04,096
Oh man so actually got that interview through Rob's daughter Joe

777
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,680
Joe Bachman is a screenwriter in Los Angeles and

778
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,752
She participated in the interview to I think it

779
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
It meant a lot

780
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:16,384
To her you know Rob's death was so sudden that I kind of got the sense

781
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:20,480
From his family that the wounds of Never Fully healed

782
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:27,392
Ferjo the chance to hear John Cleese talk about her dad in such glowing terms

783
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,696
I think it was really meaningful

784
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,024
For her and any parent and it felt really good to be there in

785
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
To hear that

786
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,328
That's so nice

787
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,608
What's the weather that happened

788
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:43,776
Yeah Rob's family has been really great and supportive of the story but particularly Joshi was really my part

789
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

835
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:43,071
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

836
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,399
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

837
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,423
A dad

838
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,775
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

839
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:56,127
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that.

840
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,151
Nothing

841
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:03,551
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

842
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:07,135
Was found dead in my private gym

843
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:11,487
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse

844
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:15,071
The cops think that I had something to do with it

845
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
Now

846
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,887
I need to clear my name

847
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:24,287
