My name is Erica Everhart and I'm the creator of the site you are listening to Los Angeles

30
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,496
And you were listening to Chicago you were listening to New York you listening to Montreal

31
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
And you are listening

32
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,176
To San Francisco

33
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,576
Azure color

34
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,648
Last year after the Giants won the World Series

35
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,000
I was out in the streets of San Francisco checking out all the different celebrations going on

36
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,864
And when I got home I was looking on Twitter I saw other people are posting links to

37
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,936
What's happening in their neighborhood people out

38
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
Lighting bonfires and

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
One thing that kept coming up was

40
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,848
Hey check out the San Francisco police radio on

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Soma FM

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,176
So I started listening to it

43
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,296
It was cool and got bored after a couple minutes and started putting on some of my music in the background

44
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,112
And something about that there was like a Synergy between

45
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,928
The police scanner and like the music I was playing

46
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,000
That really sounds cool I want to find a way to share that

47
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
Oh that's right

48
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
And since it came online on March 6th 2011 I've spent what might be considered an indoor

49
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,008
Amount of time listening to

50
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
You are listening to

51
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
Some people think it's

52
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
Peaceful some people think

53
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,408
It's creepy I think it's mesmerizing

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064
And it's elegant is in its Simplicity show me load the page there's a little Javascript file that pulls in an audio stream from Radio

55
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,136
Reference.com they provide the police radio audio

56
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,536
A playlist from SoundCloud which is music sharing site which has been screened by Everhart so that the playlist only has the

57
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,936
He's dreamy ambient soundscapes that complement the police scanner audio and also loads the background images

58
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,752
Coming from Flickr those are three main parts and they're all

59
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
Coming from site other than Maya and only possible because each of the companies provide

60
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:07,808
Simple web API application programming interface

61
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,904
You can create something new that might not be what the Creator intended

62
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:17,536
The design is being made by these sites the thing that you are listening to is exploiting

63
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Is a relinquishing

64
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:25,471
A little bit of a control of their data in order for that data to spread across the web in ways that they

65
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
He never could have imagined

66
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:31,871
In this way outside an independent developers like Everhart can act as a kind of

67
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
R&D Department

68
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,063
Radio reference and Flicker and SoundCloud and the artists offering Creative Commons royalty free music on SoundCloud

69
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,463
Well did not imagine misuse of their content but they do have an API they just created a shareable architecture

70
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,023
Sure that Taps into a remix and culture

71
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
Or new ideas can flourish

72
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
Since the site is launched and

73
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,935
It word gets around it's been very popular

74
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,007
I've been contacted by lots and lots of artists from SoundCloud

75
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,335
And they all want to be part of it they all think it's cool

76
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,407
And they're asking me can I have my music included on your site

77
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,015
You know they're not getting anything out of it they're not getting paid there's no royalties there's nothing like that

78
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
But they are getting exposure I think these are people who

79
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,391
Posted their music out there because they wanted to share it with people

80
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,207
And now they're finding their sharing with lot more people

81
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
So

82
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
It's kind of like a virtuous

83
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,559
Cycle I got Square

84
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
I created something

85
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,679
I'm not looking for anything in return the artists are getting something out of it

86
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,007
SoundCloud and radio reference are getting something out of it because there are

87
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
More people are becoming aware of their services

88
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,151
Surreally at zero cost to me or to the artist

89
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,479
We're all building something together that kind of enhance is everyone

90
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:48,159
Designing for openness allows others to answer the questions that you don't have the answers

91
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,815
Did the greatest power maybe that it allows others to ask the questions that you haven't even thought to ask

92
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,871
99percentinvisible was produced by me Roman Mars with support from lunar

99
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,983
Hey guys it's Roman Mars again and we're done with the

100
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,799
Radio portion of 99% invisible Ron to be

101
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,359
Podcast bonus content of the show

102
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Fat people

103
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:47,039
I seem to be pretty happy about so I'm going to try to keep doing this if I can add another question for Erik everhard

104
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
What about future plans

105
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
And he brought up

106
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
Are old radio piece that I did until we're going to listen to his answer about these Revolution and things he wants to do

107
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
Weather

108
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
You are listening to

109
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,143
Then he going to mention something very special to me here at the end of this clip

110
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Eagle

111
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,239
Moving forward I'd like to find a way for

112
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,031
People to be able to contribute to this

113
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,359
Some experiment with more apis more

114
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,663
Servicesonline that allow people to

115
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,247
Share audio post their thoughts in their writings about stuff

116
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,599
And then I want to find a way to be able to integrate those into the site into the audio stream

117
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
So then ultimately Maybe

118
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
You can choose between

119
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
Police radio or

120
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:33,375
Maybe like the audio equivalent of Twitter what did you have for breakfast what was the last thing that you watched on television before you went to bed

121
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,215
Because I think it's all those things mashed together would create an even more interesting kind of

122
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
Mashup of experiences and sounds

123
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Textures

124
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
I was looking at your website

125
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
And one of the things was

126
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
The Sting radio net

127
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Which

128
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:51,039
That kind of I'm like oh look someone's already done this and it with different technology 20 years ago

129
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,623
But that kind of was right where I was aiming which was like

130
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,927
Be able to take people's little short

131
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
Snippets of speech

132
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
And just throw it in there and see what happen

133
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,375
So that thing you mentioned radionet which is by Max neuhaus

134
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,447
I was obsessed with especially

135
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,543
Inta 2005 I was working for the Third Coast International audio Festival

136
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
I had to track Max new house down

137
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
And interviewed him about his various public engagement art projects on public

138
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,903
Radio that he did decades before and so here's the piece I did for the program ReSound and so the voice

139
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,951
You're going to hear is the host of ReSound

140
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
Gwen Max I

141
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,815
And I'm and you're going to hear me talkin in pinot it's a

142
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,167
Was that six years ago so a little looser

143
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:45,311
It's a little you know it's not a perfect radio story

144
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,919
Anyway I hope you enjoy it and doing it at the other side of this piece

145
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Basically

146
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,575
Radio is a one-way medium

147
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
We talk

148
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
You listen

149
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,231
Sure there public radio call-in shows that are meant to sound live

150
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
But more often than not

151
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,815
They're highly edited and reproduce

152
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
I hate to hear that

153
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
But it's true

154
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,215
The different brief moments in the history of the medium

155
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,775
Which Airways really were a free-for-all

156
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,591
Wheatley new forms of sound were born

157
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
Max neuhaus make sound work

158
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,455
Neither music nor events

159
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
He coined the term

160
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
Sound installation

161
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,087
Is Beni engine hide all sorts of new ways

162
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,647
The thinking about experiencing sound

163
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,951
A producer Roman Mars

164
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
Trent new house down in Italy

165
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,303
That Roman is responsible for the sound

166
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
Ivory sound

167
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
All music

168
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
Voices odd sound effect

169
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
Did you hear in between pieces

170
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
And that

171
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
I can tell you

172
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
Is no

173
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
Small desk

174
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,103
But when you actually hear Roman

175
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
On the air

176
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
Caulking

177
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,711
You know it's because he's become obsessed

178
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
What's something

179
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
To the show I create these mixes the sound collages

180
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
Comprised of layered elements that relate to the themes of the program and one of the elements in this mix.

181
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
Right now when I use a lot but to be able to hear it

182
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:22,079
Turn down some other stuff let's take down Transmissions from Saturn I don't know if you recognize those those are transmitted

183
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,919
The Yankee Hotel foxtrot Willmar

184
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
And the music

185
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
Right there

186
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
That's radio net

187
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
For 2 hours

188
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,327
Displayed on 200 National Public Radio affiliate stations

190
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,959
On a beautiful Sunday afternoon

191
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
Decomposition

192
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,079
With ten thousand contributing musicians

193
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
It's a sound entity really

194
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
I'm getting ahead of myself

195
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
What unit is part of the continuum

196
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
Broadcast works

197
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
By Max neuhaus

198
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
Starting with public Supply one

199
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
In 19

200
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,279
IMAX new house work with sound

201
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
Is an artist

202
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
And doesn't it

203
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
Sometimes even

204
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
I have done so for most of

205
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,983
My adult life so the last

206
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Almost 50 years

207
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,503
I was asked to do an interview radio interview

208
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,807
WBAI New York

209
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
And I thought

210
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,927
Rather than doing an interview why don't I try to do work that way

211
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
For the radio

212
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
This is a knife

213
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:48,863
66 at that time there were no radio call it shows for the idea of connecting the

214
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,703
Telephone Network to the radio station

215
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
Which I wanted to do

216
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
Make it to a space out of the radio

217
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
Gastritis

218
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:05,503
Was unheard of and it was difficult to do in fact the engineer was so sure that we would have

219
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
So

220
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
So many bad words broadcast

221
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,135
That he refused to consider

222
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,183
Project accept an interview

223
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,999
So he said in the end he would put the

224
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,815
A microphone in the studio for 2 hours

225
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
And what

226
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,655
I put into the microphone was up to me

227
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,495
So I got 10 telephone lines installed into this

228
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
WBAI Studio

229
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
And built a kind of

230
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
Rube Goldberg automatic

231
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Answering

232
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
System

233
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Because they're

234
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
Waxing machines

235
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Which allowed me to

236
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Trauma

237
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,903
Homemade box I'll make mixer

238
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
Control

239
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,255
Pick up the phone and mix

240
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,631
Which I put into an amplifier and put a loudspeaker in

241
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
Front of his maker

242
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
When it came time to go in the air

243
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
Do it on the air

244
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
Call Oxford 7

245
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
85060

246
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,407
Or Oxford 79526

247
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,455
Depart of public Supply

248
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,927
Give me a funny kind of parties that everybody that wasn't

249
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,719
Seeing each other everybody was listening

250
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,559
The word describing now is kind of a life

251
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Was a wild

252
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
Live sound collage

253
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
People

254
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
Also hearing their own voices

255
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,239
On the radio was

256
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,287
Startling thing at that time

257
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,639
Not many people had type recorded So hearing your girl voice

258
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
Was

259
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Revelation

260
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,759
Turn it it quite excited yes I mean

261
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
It was raw

262
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Swearing

263
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855

264
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:56,607
Do a couple iterations of Max new houses Publix

In addition to coming through

269
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
You clearly so that

270
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
What they were saying could I

271
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
Be understood

272
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,271
And what do people say when they're given the opportunity to be on the air for the very first time

273
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
The answer is

274
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
Kind of the same

275
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:24,255
Hi Mom hand-waving Goofy's or two things that they do when they're given the opportunity today

276
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,959
Years later a fairly new and compared to

277
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Today

278
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
Much more experimental NPR

279
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,871
And OfficeMax the opportunity to do the exact same thing

280
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Nationwide

281
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Which brings us back

282
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Tu radio net

283
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
National Public Radio prevent

284
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319

287
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Radionet is B the music

288
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
In the case will be using

289
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,071
The National Public Radio Network

290
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,655
To actually generate a piece of music from

291
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Found

292
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
Sewing material found in by

293
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,079
Anyone from anywhere

294
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,687
I think the most important thing for the listening to realize is that we're making a piece of music

295
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,783
And all one really has to do is listen with an open mind

296
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:25,183
NPR now invites you to become part of radionet dial any one of the following telephone

297
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,767
The point I was really fighting

298
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,143
Music could be made another way of this idea of really

299
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,983
Activating ale public in inventing their own music

300
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
You know it is from Mars

301
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,199
Radionet sounds different from Publix apply for a number of reasons

302
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,295
New house took advantage of the NPR distribution system of the time

303
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
Kafka round robin

304
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,623
Connected all the 200 station

305
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,439
This was normally used was that a station would feed

306
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,023
Program tell the other is by breaking into this round-robin telephone line

307
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,327
And sending it around the loop

308
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Five cities

309
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
New York Dallas

310
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,215
Atlanta Minneapolis

311
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
And subdivided the networking

312
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
Each point having its own

313
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Automatic mixer

314
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,895
Selected fractions

315
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
Of the sound

316
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
Toe beans fat in

317
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
By the phone call

318
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,295
Join the broadcast

319
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087

Pass-through itself mixer

321
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
I started losing

322
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,463
With each cross country path

323
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
Each sound mean another layer

324
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
Overlapping itself

325
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
A different pitches

326
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
The Graduate

327
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,495
What is the activation of an entire continent into a sound transformation box

328
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,335
I was literally 1500 miles wide by 3000 miles long

329
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
5 ins and outs

330
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919

CarMax new house at

332
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
And mix them all together

333
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Employment

334
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807
5 headed animals

335
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
But it didn't

336
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
Spin off into a massive

337
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Feedback loop

338
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
It was fantastic movie

339
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
I need to go from

340
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
1 station

341
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,911

Continental

343
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,287
Amazing

344
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
What was NPR steak

345
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
Because it was live

346
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
Never heard it before

347
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Imagine

348
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,087
It was risky and they were really in shock after

349
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Is over

350
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
They didn't

351
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
Want to do it again

352
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
They were really terrifying

353
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,767
In the beginning there

354
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,631
Terrorize people because they are afraid to speak

355
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
One minute

356
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,871
30 seconds

357
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Panic

358
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
Semi-regular

359
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
He's really quite

360
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,735
Pizza Hot

361
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
To listen to

362
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
But still 2 hours

363
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
For them

364
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,391
Primetime Sunday afternoon

367
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
But anyway I

368
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,839
I had them and they had me

369
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,655
If we were there for two hours

370
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,495
What day is it

371
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,103
Nobody talkin about a Repeat Performance 1978 is like God

372
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,711
We live through it we could have to cover I have to somehow but

373
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
They were in shock

374
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,807
NPR

375
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,599
Rihanna was definitely

376
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,159
A moment in time along with public Supply

377
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
But do you think they're

378
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Tigger

379
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
Lessons for radio

380
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,351
Shoot Lee radio did take this idea

381
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,911
And it shaped it to fit it

382
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Have you ever called a joke

383
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,287
It's on the other end of the spectrum at least

384
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
Two-way in a trillion

385
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Jania

386
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,895
But out of call for college

387
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
You get

388
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
Immediately

389
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
What

390
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,551
Certain people who are willing to call in or thinking about

391
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
Even though it's it's very

392
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Gold

393
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,463
Did moderated and that I think is very positive

394
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,559
I don't need all this work is that at the time Max neuhaus

395
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
Furbabies compositions

396
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
From being recorded

397
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
Who's idea was that

398
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,959
They existed as entities

399
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,031
That any listener should be able to modify

400
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,591
What they're hearing by contributing to the composition

401
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Something that

402
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Couldn't happen

403
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
It was a music

404
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
Courtney

405
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967
He was very strict about the

406
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,503
No recording

407
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
Was to be married

408
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
Annie's best I can tell

409
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,111
Not one engineer

410
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
WBAI wfmt

411
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
Or national public radio

412
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Listen to

413
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,303
Which is the only reason why they're available to be heard today

414
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,863
Because you can violate a lot of rules

415
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,007
You can turn a one-way medium like radio into a two-way communication device and synthesizer

416
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,591
You can put people's voices on the air unmoderated and unfiltered

417
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
But under no

418
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
Circumstances

419
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
Can you stop

420
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
A radio engineer

421
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:10,367
Recording a sound producer

422
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,951
I'm in Mars talking with sound artist Max neuhaus

423
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,279
The next Evolution Max neuhaus is broadcast work

424
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Called Oracle

425
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839
AU

426
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
Racl

427
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,935
And it's sort of an online version of radio net

428
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,007
But it's 24 hours a day and anyone can play

429
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
You can find a link

430
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079

433
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:52,095
Died a couple years ago I think he's just the greatest and so I'm really sad that he's gone

434
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,959
I have a link to IMAX new houses website as well as the Third Coast International audio Festival

435
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,543
That I work for 4 to 2 or 3 years

436
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,687
And other great and they have a program called ReSound that I helped work on for a long time

437
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:13,087
The website is amazing and they're just a great group if you want to stay on top of all the really amazing

438
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,440

Take care

444
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:46,368
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

445
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
The body genius is a dark

446
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
Comic mystery

447
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,768
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

448
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,048
We're looking the part

449
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
Might cost you your life

450
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,960
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

451
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,312
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

452
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:09,664
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

453
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,016
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

454
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:20,416
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of thing if you

455
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,048
2 days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

456
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,376
Was found dead in my private gym

457
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:35,776
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had something

458
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
Nothing to do with it now

459
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,480
I need to clear my name somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do what
