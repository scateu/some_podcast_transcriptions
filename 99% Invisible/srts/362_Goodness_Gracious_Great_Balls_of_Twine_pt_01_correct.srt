1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,048
This is 99% invisible

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:09,984
We are waist-deep in summer right now which is a great time of year

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,776
You're in the podcast business

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:12,800
Because

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:16,384
It's road trip season time to hop in the car

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:23,296
You of your favorite podcast

7
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,576
And hit

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344
The road

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,464
That's pretty sure Vivian Lee and we recently sent her on a 1200 Mile Road Trip

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488
Through the Midwest

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,304
They saw a lot of things along the way

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,936
Bob Dylan's childhood home a guitar made out of a bedpan the inside of about 400 boxes

13
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:44,800
The chicken McNuggets lots of horses

14
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,616
But we didn't send Vivian out to look for horses

15
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,920
Order check a few States offer bucket list

16
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,272
She was on a mission that require two equal parts science philosophy

17
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,040
And Dairy

18
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,624
In search of something that's been hotly contested four-decade

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392
Gates

20
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,672
The world's largest

21
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
Ball of twine

22
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:07,328
I began my quest by following in the footsteps of the great Weird Al Yankovic

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,984
I heard about in Minnesota

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
About an hour away

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,712
Best of St Paul is a tiny little city called Darwin

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,808
It isn't the kind of place you'd expect to find a great Wonder of

27
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,136
The population is only about 3:50

28
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:36,000
I accidentally circled the entire downtown in about 2 minutes while looking for parking

29
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,560
The main street is only three blocks long

30
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
There's a bank

31
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:44,448
Water Tower and a 9-10 ball of twine entombed in a plexiglass gazebo

32
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
Hotels

33
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,568
World's largest ball of twine made by one man

34
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
It's very round

35
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,712
Very round and nicely shaped

36
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,576
It's hard to get a good look from the outside because of the reflection of the class

37
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,904
But once you press your face up against those windows

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,440
Will see this enormous

39
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,512
Perfectly round orb that's comprised of brown twine

40
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,328
The ball is the pride of Darwin

41
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,400
But before Courtney Johnson milk here

42
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
She had never even heard of

43
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
When I first

44
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,824
To the area I didn't know anything about the twine ball

45
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
Johnson's husband grew up in Darwin

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
So she asking

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
I was like what is this

48
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
And he's like

49
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,296
It's the twine ball and I kind of laughed at it be

50
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Because

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,184
It is kind of silly if you think about it and he's like don't laugh because we're related to them

52
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
Courtney's husband is a distant nephew of France

53
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
Chris Johnson

54
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,072
The man who rolled the Darwin twine ball

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,912
Is she and her husband actually inherited the Johnson family farm

56
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:52,032
Which is where the story of great great uncle Francis and his giant ball of twine

57
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Begins

58
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,920
I'd like to tell you that Francis Johnson had a vision of doing something Majestic

59
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,248
Rolling the largest ball of twine the country ever seen

60
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
But the truth is

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
He just had too much

62
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
Find lying around

63
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
Johnson was a farmer

64
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,928
And his farm like all Farms really

65
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
Lousy

66
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Which wine

67
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
And one day in 1950

68
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,072
What cleaning up after his nephew Harlan

69
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,888
Johnson started rolling some of that extra 20

70
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
Into a ball

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
So he

72
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
Of course

73
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
Pick up the twine yelling at Harlan

74
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
That is just

75
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,360
Young and needs to start picking up after himself wall

76
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,408
Before you know it he had

77
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
You know it was 6 in twine ball

78
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,016
Well the 6-inch light bulb won't get into a foot

79
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,576
For reasons unknown even to himself

80
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,880
Johnson roll that ball of twine

81
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
The next

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,184
29 years

83
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,024
Between ball was easy enough to run its early stages

84
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
Johnson would work on it in the basement

85
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
But as it got bigger

86
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,936
She had to move the ball outside or it gets stuck down there for good

87
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,288
Here's an interview with Johnson from an early eighties TV show called real people

88
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
I had to roll it out of the basement

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,968
I can still get it through a 30 inch door and it's been Outdoors ever since

90
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
And it was Outdoors on his front lawn

91
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
They rolled it for 4 hours a day

92
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
Every single day

93
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,976
It became an addiction in on possession and it was something that he wanted

94
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
To do because it

95
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
Spark something inside of him

96
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
Princess Johnson was a perfect

97
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
And he was Adam

98
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,959
That is twine ball should be a perfectly round sphere

99
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,775
Has it got bigger he rolled it around the yard

100
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
To make sure he added 20 evenly

101
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
So it remained beautifully

102
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Symmetry

103
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
Especially

104
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:39,039
The ball got so big that he couldn't roll it around his yard anymore with just his body weight

105
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:44,159
Johnson invented an ingenious method to rotate the volume using railroad Jack

106
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,511
A jack under the ball and use it to nudge the ball forward

107
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559
And then the ball would roll

108
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,167
Intercourse on the other side of it he would have something to stop the ball from Rolling completely

109
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,983
He repeated this process over and over

110
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,055
Rolling a ball of twine rolling the ball

111
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
Adding more twine

112
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,967
Roll it around his yard change it to a tree so no one would steal twine ball at me who wouldst

113
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
Still trying Ball but that was the way he was

114
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,183
The ball attracted a lot of attention both in and out of Darwin it appeared on television that written about

115
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,511
Newspapers and Weird Al would eventually write a song about it

116
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,375
The ball had made Johnson's famous even if he wasn't willing to admit it

117
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,191
Well I don't know about that

118
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
About being famous

119
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,591
Alamar this little guy from Michigan

120
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:40,735
They got they got to take me to Cheyenne

121
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,831
Princesses toy ball was absolutely massive

122
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,903
It had to be the largest ball of twine in the world

123
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
So that's what he called it

124
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
Biggest ball of twine in the world

125
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
There's no one come forth with the bigger one

126
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,119
Until

127
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
Someone dead

128
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
I'm Linda clover

129
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
I live in cawker City Kansas

130
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,079
And I'm a caretaker of the world's largest ball of twine

131
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,663
Cawker city is about 500 miles south of Darwin

132
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
They too have a massive ball of twine

133
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
And it's Linda's job to look after it

134
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
The Wall Street Journal calls me the Bell

135
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Of the wall

136
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,415
Bet a twosome

137
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
Local people I think I'm the crazy

138
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
Sweet wine lady

139
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,815
Cawker City population is a little larger than Darwin

140
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
But walking around you wouldn't guess it

141
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,679
It almost felt like an empty set of a western movie

142
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,239
And in some of the windows of the abandoned storefronts

143
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,543
There's twine ball inspired artwork

144
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
The Mona Lisa holding a twine ball

145
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,663
And what of Georgia o'keeffe's flowers with the twine ball at the center

146
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
We have things going on

147
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
But not match but that's okay

148
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,319
We have beautiful sunrises and sunsets

149
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
And

150
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
The wonderful Lake

151
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,791
They also have an absolutely gigantic toy ball sitting under an open-air gazebo right in the center of town

152
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
And unlike it

153
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,631
Counterpart in Darwin which is trapped behind glass

154
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
This one you can walk right up to InTouch

155
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,751
We want people to be able to smell it

156
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
Because twine has it

157
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
It sounds ragrets

158
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
It certainly does

159
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
Who's got a smell

160
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
Food smells moist

161
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,671
Linda Clover may be the caretaker of a Cocker City twine Ball but it was ruled by a man named Frank stauber

162
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
Stober started in 1953

163
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,351
Coincidentally right around the same time that Johnson was getting going up in Minnesota

164
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
Amazingly

165
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,935
Two men about the same time

166
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,495
One in Minnesota and one man from Kansas

167
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
Did twine balls

168
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
Sober was a farmer

169
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,967
That's like Francis Johnson and he got started rolling his ball of twine and basically the exact same way that Johnson.

170
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,527
He started it because he was cleaning up his

171
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,599
Barn and the man just was picking up

172
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
Which wine because it was on

173
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Kiss Barn floor

174
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,231
Thinking he would roll it into a ball

175
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Put it into a

176
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
Have to get it out of the way

177
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,143
Dover and Johnson were both raised with a depression-era reluctance to waste

178
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,167
Anything at all

179
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:12,287
Suppertime super may not have been the first person to try to roll the world's biggest twine ball

180
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
But he certainly had a talent for it

181
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
My 1956

182
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
6 to 3 years in

183
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,223
Stober's ball was already seven and a half feet tall

184
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,271
And weighed over 4000 pound

185
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
Nearly the size of the Darwin

186
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Football

187
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
I think it starts with people

188
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,743
Maybe making fun of them because it's such a ludicrous thing but then

189
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,351
You quickly realize there's something about them that you know it's somebody who took

190
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
What should have been insignificant little pieces of

191
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
Twine or string or garbage

192
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,519
And they made something that's essentially made them immortal

193
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,591
This is Doug Kirby the co-founder of Roadside America

194
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,663
Which is a website dedicated to documenting the court

195
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
Cookies

196
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,735
Kitschy roadside attractions along our highways

197
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
The balls are pretty much a pilgrimage site for different groups now because you really can't go through

198
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,975
Minnesota Arkansas and not detour to see those walls

199
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,559
Herbie been tracking the status of the balls for a long time

200
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:11,167
And when I went to meet with him he even sketched out a little cartoon timeline for me

201
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,799
He says that for a stretch of time it looked like stober's ball in cawker City might have taken the lead

202
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
There's no record and we'd have our speculation on the website which was that pucker cities hit 11 feet and 8

203
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
61

204
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
By this point stober's ball have become

205
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
Popular attraction in Central Kansas

206
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,159
He would take it to local fairs and people would try to guess the weight

207
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
It was such a hit that town officials asked over

208
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,583
If you could bring the twine ball into the town to put it on permanent display

209
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
And then finally

210
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
After Decades of speculation

211
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,239
The world's largest ball of twine became official in

212
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,055
Pretty much the only way these sorts of things can

213
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,919
Yes it was in the Guinness Book of World Records

214
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
Officials from the Guinness Book of World Records

215
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,039
Kima cawker City Kansas in 1973

216
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,647
Declared stober's ball the official world's largest ball of twine at 11 ft

217
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Diameter

218
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
Fortunately

219
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
Glory was short-lived

220
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,767
Because he died the following year and then

221
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
74

222
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,095
Meanwhile up in Darwin Minnesota

223
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
Johnson was still alive and kicking

224
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
And rolling

225
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,775
He kept going until he surpassed over his ball and Dethrone cawker City

226
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,847
For the Guinness World Record just a few years later

227
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,431
And without anyone left to challenge his place in history

228
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
Johnson retired

229
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
220 ball rolling

230
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
He died 10 years later

231
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
Promethazine

232
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
At the age of 85

233
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
It was a long disease

234
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
That didn't

235
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,975
Kill him and

236
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:44,095
We look at family history there's no history of it so a lot of people say is inhaling twine

237
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:48,703
In chemicals in all that throughout those years that probably was the reason of his death

238
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,287
It's family contends that Johnson's lifelong passion

239
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Ultimately killed

240
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,223
Yeah but I don't think you change anything if someone were to tell him you know you're going to die from SUV looks old and you keep doing it

241
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
In the story could have ended there

242
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
With two dead twin men

243
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,719
Largest ball of twine in the world and the second largest ball of

244
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Wine in the world

245
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
But

246
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
Cawker City wasn't finished yet

247
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
Stupid left the twine ball to the city after

248
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
He died

249
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,727
Infer few years it just sat there in the downtown gazebo

250
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
A tribute to the

251
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
The second greatest twine ball roller in history

252
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
But then the town decided

253
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,151
They didn't want to settle for second-best

254
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
We decided let's have some

255
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
Sean

256
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,759
And we started having

257
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
What we call our annual

258
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
Resident of cawker City decided to jump in and start adding more twine to the Stover ball to see if they could beat the

259
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
The record again

260
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,303
But this time it wouldn't be the product of one man

261
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
But an entire community

262
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:52,703
The town had what was a brilliant idea which was let's let the community keep rolling it

263
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,519
Here's Doug Kirby from Roadside America again

264
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:02,175
He says that cawker City started holding twine Athens once a year where everyone in town would gather to help grow the twine ball

265
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
And eventually

266
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
They started allowing visitors to wrap

267
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,039
The twine ball on a daily basis

268
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
Give me the ball

269
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,903
Became be reason to visit cawker City

270
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
What's the weather was townspeople

271
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
More visitors and let's just have it

272
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
The ball set up so that

273
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,351
All the schools ready you can add to the

274
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,167
The ball you'll see immediately that you're

275
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
Adding to this world records

276
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
So it's a

277
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
It's a different

278
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
If it's a different approach

279
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,663
When did Clover literally keep spools of twine on her at all times

280
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,967
On the off chance that she runs into someone

281
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
She wants to add to the ball

282
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,807
If you go to my car or my pickup

283
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,391
Either one has twine that I have ready to let

284
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
People add twine on to the ball

285
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
Anyone else in town

286
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
Carrie's twine with them

287
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,607
But Linda Clover does

288
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:58,239
So many people participating the cawker city ball continues to grow bigger and bigger

289
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
The latest estimate

290
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
How to get 20000

291
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
500 lb

292
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,407
Over 2500 lbs heavier than Johnson

293
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
And when you see it in person

294
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,039
It's unquestionably larger in circumference

295
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,159
But not everyone agrees that rolling 20 balls

296
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
Should be a group project

297
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,743
Especially in Darwin

298
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,351
Courtney says that Johnson's ball is particularly impressive not just because of its

299
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Perfectly round shape

300
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,959
But because it was the soul accomplished

301
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
The one man

302
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,079
It needed to be done by him cuz it needed to be perfect and need to be solid

303
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,895
Needs to be done with only a certain type of twine

304
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,711
You know he was just so particular needed things done

305
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
By himself

306
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
And remember

307
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,879
Johnson had his own special technique for rolling a perfectly symmetrical sphere

308
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
People of cawker City

309
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Don't have that

310
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
They have no way to wrap the top

311
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,071
In the bottom of the ball so it just keeps getting wider and wider

312
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
In fact

313
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
It's not really a ball anymore

314
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
Moreauville with a flat bottom

315
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
So

316
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
Cawker City Spa

317
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Bigger

318
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,847
But the Darwin ball is definitely nicer to look at

319
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Darwin

320
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,711
Is by far my favorite ball

321
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
This is Edward Meyer

322
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
And he's currently retired

323
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,599
But up until a year ago

324
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
He had probably

325
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,183
The coolest job I've ever heard of

326
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
My primary focus

327
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
What's the by Xzibit

328
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
Put in the museum

329
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,887
Ripley's calls Auditorium spelled o d d

330
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,935
Around the world

331
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,543
Where was vice president of exhibits in archives with Ripley's Believe It or Not

332
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:41,407
Wing it was literally his job to find the weirdest things in the world and put them on display

333
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
And back in the early 90s

334
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,015
Zion Darwin's giant twine ball

335
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
The Darwin ball

336
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,719
It's almost romantic as it's one man's dream and it takes him a long time

337
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:59,583
And he has certain Rules by and doesn't break

338
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:07,519
Getting silly I guess but now it's it's an accomplishment like climbing Everest

339
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,615
Meyer had been interested in the Darwin twine ball for years

340
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
And as luck would have it

341
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
Johnson's nephew

342
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
If you had inherited

343
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
His entire estate

344
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Including

345
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
The twine ball

346
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,671
Johnson's nephew caldemeyer up one day to ask if you wanted to come to Darwin and possibly purchase the ball

347
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,279
He invited me and I said sure I'd love to come

348
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:34,399
Meyer was asked to pitch the town on the idea of putting Johnson's twine ball in a Ripley's Museum

349
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Personally

350
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
He thought

351
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,007
What better way to honor Johnson's accomplishments

352
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,567
Going to put it on display or possibly thousands of

353
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
People of week would see it

354
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,663
I gave a presentation

355
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,223
But I wanted to buy

356
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,319
The reaction was all over our dead body

357
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
I was

358
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
Probably one of the most

359
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,463
Uncomfortable evenings in my entire life

360
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,071
I was literally in fear of my life

361
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
Not sure how this was going to end

362
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Weather alert

363
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,215
He wasn't murdered by mob of angry townspeople

364
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
But they were pretty upset

365
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
For 1

366
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
The people of Darwin thought the

367
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Twine ball

368
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
Could bring in Torres

369
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Come to the area

370
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
The more important

371
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
The ball had become

372
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
Part of Darwin's identity

373
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
Slimeball is a good analogy with say it

374
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,599
The twine that binds represents

375
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,671
Do you know not only are we support that but

376
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Support of each other

377
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,231
This is Josh Johnson

378
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Send the mayor of Darwin

379
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,095
The town had adopted the ball is there around so much so

380
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
But they even started an annual tradition

381
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
Call Darwin twine ball day

382
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:44,799
Which includes a number of twine ball related activities like at Wind Cave which is

383
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Kind of like a 5K

384
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
It starts out with

385
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039
A 17400 400-foot run that's 70400 foot run to celebrate us

386
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,087
17400 pound twine ball

387
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,879
They pass out candy to kids

388
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,719
Roll miniature versions of the twine ball down the street and have a parade

389
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,583
He probably last round 35 minutes which is the right length for a parade these days in my opinion

390
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:11,167
Francis Johnson ball had become Central to life in Darwin

391
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,775
And that we made it clear that if Meijer wanted a giant twine ball for Ripley's

392
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
He would have to get it from some other town

393
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103
And that's exactly

394
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
What Edward Meyer dad

395
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,455
Well I literally read it in an airplane magazine

396
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
At this guy in Texas

397
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Had been inspired

398
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,623
As much by cawker city as he had been by a Darwin

399
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:36,511
As it turned out while Darwin and cawker city were battling it out in their public twine ball arms race

400
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,071
A third ball was rapidly growing in

401
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Texas

402
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,655
The hands of a man named JC Payne

403
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,495
Paint was retired Brick Mason who was the type of guy

404
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,799
Who was always in search of a new project

405
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
And in the late 1980s

406
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
Hefei

407
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,967
Pain had read about the Battle of the balls in Darwin and cawker City

408
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,271
And have a clear favorite in the rain

409
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,903
From the beginning JCPenney did not want cawker City to beat Francis Johnson

410
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:10,559
Apparently pain was not a fan of the fact that the cawker City Community effort was about to beat Johnson solo Pro

411
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,631
Paine believed in the great man Theory

412
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
20 Barbara Lane

413
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
E-thot

414
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
You know that it was a shame the cawker city was going to be bigger than Darwin's cuz the whole town was involved in it

415
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:29,759
He thought that this was no I use the word cheating but that's my interpretation

416
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,623
And said y'all if Francis isn't going to be the world's biggest then I'm going to be

417
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,487
Can you start rolling his ball until 1987

418
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,791
Apple 37 years after

419
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,935
The by 1992 the Guinness Book of World Records declared it the largest ball in the world

420
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
In a few short years

421
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,055
He managed to create a ball that was 42 ft in circumference

422
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
13 ft tall and weighed six

423
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Tons

424
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,711
Part of it is that he had a tool used

425
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,087
Technology to add the string to it he had a tractor he had a hook type

426
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
Implemented

427
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:13,791
Prevented him from getting his hands wrecked that he wasn't literally even touching it at some point

428
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:19,679
Part of it was the euro used whatever he could get in terms of string nylon specifically

429
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,007
Which bothered a lot of twine ball Pier is to like to think of

430
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
Twine anymore traditional

431
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
More natural scent

432
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
I seen the pile of

433
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,895
Is that plastic

434
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,199
You're Linda Clover from cawker City again

435
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,503
They're complaining were talking apples and oranges

436
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
You know complete

437
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
Something completely different

438
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,135
The main gripe about JC paintball

439
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,951
Was that he used artificial colored nylon twine

440
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
Well Johnson and Stover

441
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
Both used sisal twine

442
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
Sisal is an earthy color

443
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
Plant-based material

444
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
It has that classic

445
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,727
Whereas nylon just looks like City Slicker twice

446
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:58,847
Nylon also weighs less making paintball much lighter than both cawker City and Darwin

447
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,431
The end result was a multi colored artificial

448
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
Lighter weight

449
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
Monstrosity

450
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
And Edward Meyer from Ripley

451
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Had to have a

452
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,647
My buying it was a backhanded

453
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,951
No I'll buy this because

454
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,767
You know I've missed out the one I really wanted but

455
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
I can still get one

456
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:22,655
So he flew to Valley View Texas to meet pain in person and see the ball for himself

457
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,215
Nice band salt of the earth

458
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,031
A little bit on the competitive side

459
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,591
But

460
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Basic

461
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,991
Football when I first saw

462
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
Pretty darn good

463
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
But it didn't look good for long

464
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,927
Pretty soon they realize that they have to move this 6

465
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,255
Tongue ball Ripley's Museum being built

466
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
In Branson Missouri

467
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:56,191
Well we dragged it out of the barn and that messed it up a little bit and then we had to

468
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Rain

469
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,567
Which messed it up more and then it was

470
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,383
Drop onto a flatbed tractor

471
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,199
Flattens

472
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,343
And then it was driven 3000 miles to Branson Missouri from Denton Texas

473
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:19,232
Build this misshapen monster of a ball was going to be the PS2 resistance

474
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
Of the new Ripley's Museum

475
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:25,632
And the ball was so huge that the building had to be constructed around it

476
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
If for any reason

477
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,960
They ever need to move it out of there

478
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,264
So either need to take the roof off

479
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,056
Or blast a hole in the wall

480
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,640
Oh wow

481
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,200
Yeah it's huge

482
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,296
I went to see pains twine ball for myself at the Ripley's in Branson

483
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
A person

484
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
It's a little Blobby looking

485
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,672
Like a ball of cookie dough that's been sitting out for

486
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Too long

487
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,280
It's comprised of shiny nylon strands every color of the rainbow

488
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
Pretty impressive

489
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:00,704
But it's it's on display between an ornate miniature Palace carved out of camel bone

490
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,520
And a 6-foot ship made entirely of jade

491
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
Honestly

492
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,592
Those are so beautiful that

493
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,640
They make the ball look a little bit

494
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
Not to mention something else I noticed

495
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
So

496
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,296
I'm just noticing something right now which is that

497
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,136
On the sign it doesn't say the world's largest

498
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,720
20 wallet says world's largest string ball

499
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
So it's not even

500
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,816
Technically designated as twine

501
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
Here at Ripley's

502
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
In this

503
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,264
Might be why the Great American twine ball contest

504
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,312
Or string ball contest

505
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,640
Is never going to get a satisfying clear-cut winner

506
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:45,248
Because no one is ever going to agree on the rules of the contest

507
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,296
But at this point

508
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:52,416
All the contestants seem to be okay with the version of the story where everyone wins

509
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,744
Which town has the largest twine ball

510
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
Depending on what you mean by that

511
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Darwin

512
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376
Is the largest twine ball rolled by one man

513
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
Copper City

514
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
Is the largest ball of sisal twine

515
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,544
NGC pains is the largest nylon string ball

516
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
It's a three-way truce

517
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Except

518
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Hi

519
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
Is it okay if we come over

520
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
This is

521
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,952
Very impressive

522
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
Of course it is

523
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,792
Yep there's a fourth ball

524
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,096
And this one is in the Northwoods of Wisconsin

525
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,936
The man whose rolling it is named James Franco Terra

526
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,728
But he prefers to go by JF

527
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,848
I visited him at the end of my road trip

528
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
And

529
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:49,760
He doesn't talk a whole lot but he has handmade signs posted all over his property with the story of his ball

530
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,552
He writes that one night

531
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,344
1975

532
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,928
And told him that he was going to stop drinking

533
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
Turn his life around

534
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,256
Become the world famous

535
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Quiet Man

536
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
And that's more or less what he did

537
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:08,960
Is anybody help you with it at all

538
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,288
JFK's ball is a little different from the rest

539
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
Small segments of

540
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,432
Colorful twine and weaves and Tux the individual pieces into the ball

541
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
So the surface resemble the net

542
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
Don't do a lot harder for

543
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
Trying to reach the top

544
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,600
So the balls lot wider than

545
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,184
It almost looks like a modern art

546
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,512
Multicolored Funfetti but

547
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Potato

548
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,120
Try to make it as loud as you can but it's hard

549
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,960
In JFK claims that his ball is the largest by using a

550
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Different metric

551
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Wait

552
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,568
23375 pounds

553
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,176
JFK thinks his ball is about 20 3375

554
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,968
Based on his calculations

555
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,040
Nearly 3000 pounds heavier than conquer City

556
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,880
He says he knows this because before adding twine to the ball

557
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,672
He puts it in the garbage bag

558
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
Waze it

559
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,000
And then adds the total to his overall measure by

560
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,536
If he's correct

561
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,072
Kiss is definitely

562
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
The heaviest

563
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
Of the 420 balls

564
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,752
But Gypsies not looking for official records

565
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,104
Doesn't need some Outsider to come in and tell him what he already believes

566
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,920
Have you heard of The Guinness Book of World Records

567
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,992
Are you interested in having them come to measure it at all

568
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
No no I do it myself

569
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,600
So you don't you don't really care about what they have to say

570
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,904
This is my this is just for you

571
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
So for now

572
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,536
A careful balance is intact

573
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,096
The four largest twine balls exist

574
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Peacefully

575
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
Alongside with

576
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,728
Each content with their own version of superiority

577
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,056
Because there are so many ways to have the biggest ball of

578
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Something

579
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,896
Like the largest ball of stamps in Boys Town Nebraska

580
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
Or the largest ball of VHF

581
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
Steven Kent

582
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,528
Where the world's largest disco ball in the UK

583
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,808
Let It Go video

584
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,368
What about the world's largest ball of paint

585
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Indiana

586
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
It's time to come home

587
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,640
I talked to Vivian about other roadside attractions on her death-defying Midwestern tour

588
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
After this

589
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,856
So I'm back in the studio with Vivien Leigh and in addition to

590
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Scene

591
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Many many

592
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
Balls

593
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,232
When we were following a lot

594
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,560
We were deeply concerned about your

595
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
Your safety and well-being

596
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,424
I was actually very I was very concerned about my C

597
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
Taking over being at the same time

598
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,752
And it's not because it's wine it was

599
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,776
Because the weather

600
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
Apparently

601
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,408
If you're going to if you're going to plan a reporting trip

602
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,016
To a part of the country called Tornado Alley you should probably check

603
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:08,416
When tornado season is because I happen to be there during the peak of tornado season and there's the most

604
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,440
Tornado activity

605
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
11 or 12 or so

606
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,328
Yasso tornadoes where

607
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:21,728
We're Landing all around you

608
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:26,336
Don't open at all times and I was tracking the storm and being the exact opposite

609
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,896
Bill Paxton in the movie Twister

610
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,992
Track the storm and go as fast as I can the opposite direction

611
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,040
But it was a bummer because

612
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,832
I figured I've never been in this part of the

613
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,416
The country before so I can see I can make a list of all these

614
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
She said I wanted to

615
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
Cecile on the way

616
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,048
I'm so I really want to see the Frank Lloyd Wright

617
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
Gas station

618
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
In Minnesota

619
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,120
And

620
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,680
I want to see like the world's biggest banjo but I do

621
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,496
Cuz I was like rushing from place to place

622
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,664
But one of the places

623
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,224
That I really really wanted to say but just

624
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
Could not

625
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
Gets you in time

626
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:11,904
It was in Lucas Kansas and it's called the world's largest collection of the smallest versions

627
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
The worlds large

628
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Sphinx

629
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,280
You said the worlds

630
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
Largest collection

631
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Of the

632
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,680
Smallest versions of the world's largest chain

633
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:30,080
Understand everything you need is in the title has a lot of different types of roadside

634
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,408
Most popular in the biggest category is

635
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
World's largest

636
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
Things

637
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,528
Basically a collection of miniature eyes

638
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,344
Versions of all the world's larges

639
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
Just things

640
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:46,208
In the country so there's this probably about 400 in the

641
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
Fattest States

642
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
And

643
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,584
This woman named Erica Nelson has been basically traveling around

644
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,632
And making

645
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:57,216
Small versions of all the world's largest roadside attractions

646
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,384
And up she's an independent artist and educator in Lucas Kansas so I was so fascinated by this that I decide

647
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
Cited to call her and ask her a little bit about how it works

648
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:12,320
I go to a world's largest thing photographic Gatherings background story

649
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,624
Then I make a world smallest version

650
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,696
At world's largest thing and added to my collection

651
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,488
And since I've been doing this

652
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,024
For 15 years now

653
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,584
I now have the world's largest collection

654
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,168
Of those world's smallest versions of the world's largest

655
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
Goodness

656
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,568
Oh I like her

657
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,408
So why in the world did she start doing

658
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,480
So she would visit these roadside attractions

659
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
I'm in a lot of times they wouldn't

660
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
How to gift shop

661
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,576
Had to bring home a souvenir Sochi

662
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
She started

663
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,392
Making her own souvenirs

664
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,720
I'm in the form of these miniaturized version of these worlds

665
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,328
Just for herself and she just made her own thing

666
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,168
So now she has no over 200 miniatures

667
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
In her class

668
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,544
She still doing it so she still goes to world's largest things

669
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,104
And still makes me want to see

670
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
Awkward

671
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,944
But she has a process where she goes

672
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,064
All 400 like that's the that's the number of world's largest things inside of America

673
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,136
Fluctuates so there's always more popping up

674
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
And there's some that are just

675
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,720
Disappearing from lack of care or

676
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,512
Don't want to maintain them anymore

677
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,560
So Nelson Has

678
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,400
Like a special affinity for the world's largest things like these types of roses

679
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:35,520
But she's also fascinated with Roadside Attraction culture as a whole

680
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,824
And she was telling me that

681
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,896
You know if you look at it from a historical standpoint

682
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,200
You can see the ways in which infrastructure

683
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:47,552
And a push towards car culture have created this environment for roadside

684
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,344
Add fractions to really flourish

685
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,208
In that 1950s 1960s it was also not just our

686
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
Good roads policy

687
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,792
Des interconnectedness

688
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
That we suddenly felt

689
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,376
Witter automobiles

690
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,912
What's really salty

691
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:07,520
This is how you get your own personal freedom is by having this machine that can

692
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:12,128
Take you as far as you're willing to take it so all these little towns popped up in

693
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:16,736
In just the right distance to fuel up again or get water again

694
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,808
Use the bathroom again or asleep again

695
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:24,672
But then the interstate system kind of bypass everything and all these small towns.

696
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,000
Search become dependent on slow travel

697
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,840
We're being bypassed and I think those roadside attractions

698
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,376
Word that

699
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,656
Way to get people to

700
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
Stop again

701
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,264
The whiskey if you don't need to stop at town for gas

702
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,056
Or water or to use the bathroom

703
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
You have to create something

704
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,944
Gorditos the reason why. That's why you create

705
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,344
The world's largest Paul Bunyan statue cuz I just didn't pull people off the road

706
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,368
You normally just beat

707
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,392
Completely bypassed

708
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,696
I'm so it's just a way to take

709
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Keep your economy

710
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,256
I'm kind of curious about this

711
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,816
World's largest phenomenon like is this just

712
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,632
An American thing that we like to make

713
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,912
The largest

714
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,984
Things are possible

715
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
Very distinctly

716
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:17,408
The world's largest ball of twine I don't think I could do anything

717
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
Go to Switzerland to get the worlds

718
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,088
Actually ask Nelson about this

719
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,648
And she says it's not

720
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,232
Specifically like an American thing but it's kind of like a new world

721
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
Country swing

722
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:38,656
I think part of that is that love of superlatives does seem not just an American

723
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,216
Something that is very young country kind of see

724
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:45,824
Because Australia and Canada also have that sort of need

725
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,616
To make a mark

726
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:54,016
Because we're kind of lacking in that old old old history of our built environment because everybody who

727
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,368
Here was much more in tune with nature and didn't make giant monuments

728
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,160
To themselves so once we

729
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:03,744
Started making our own history we realize we don't have much

730
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,536
So we started doing these

731
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,072
Superlative things

732
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,376
The kind of loudmouth show offi

733
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,168
Say hey we're here

734
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:11,936
This is

735
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,216
Look at our chicken

736
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Look at it

737
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,944
Who is because we don't have something like that

738
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
The pantheon

739
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
We have

740
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:30,880
The world's largest frying pans or something like that

741
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,720
What I think I like most about

742
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
The world's largest

743
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,512
Question

744
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,792
Of the smallest versions

745
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:42,656
Of the world's largest things project isn't isn't just that it's

746
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,960
You know a catalog of the biggest things

747
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
It's

748
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,776
Also wait for Nelson to really explore the

749
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,800
Stories behind

750
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,384
You know The small-town Monuments that aren't traditionally valued from an

751
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
Academic standing

752
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
Right I mean I guess

753
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
There isn't the same sort of

754
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,552
Academic rigor applied to

755
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:04,672
Roadside attractions as there is other forms of vernacular architecture but there's no reason why

756
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,952
Yeah exactly

757
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,744
Nelson actually says that this

758
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
Attitude

759
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,792
Kind of ship

760
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,560
Lately

761
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,376
I think there's a growing number of people who are

762
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,448
Who are taking them seriously and I've had those

763
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,008
Debate since learning from Las Las Vegas

764
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:22,336
Just came out and ended up being such a tone for architects

765
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,896
They address that very thing is

766
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,200
When is when is Kitchen Bouquet

767
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,016
When is populous architecture okay

768
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,368
And so with that introduction into scholarly debate

769
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
People started

770
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:39,232
Looking at then again all of these things that they grown up around

771
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,072
The built environment and re-evaluating them in

772
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,864
The lenses that they were taught

773
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,656
To look at more serious

774
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
And we covered a lot of this stuff in it

775
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,800
Story Avery dad about Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi about

776
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
Gallery from Las Vegas

777
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:54,848
I mean this

778
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
Idea that

779
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:59,200
Yeah they became really advocates for the architecture of Las Vegas

780
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:05,344
That most people and even people like I performed in Las Vegas for the a conference and somebody wrote me

781
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,160
To say I can't believe we're doing it in Lost

782
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
Guess there is nothing of value

783
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
And I was like

784
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:17,888
It was a whole book about it

785
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
Around the stinking

786
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,192
You know in

787
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,216
In general

788
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
We should

789
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Think about

790
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,032
What people go to

791
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
You know because

792
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,152
You know that's worth evaluating why they want to be in place

793
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,200
Lake Las Vegas I mean really does Tita

794
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,504
Yes exactly like that that demand is

795
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
There for a reason

796
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,600
Giant fiberglass pheasant

797
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:41,952
Or a twine ball might I mean yes it's silly and it comes off

798
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,256
It's too late but people are drawn to these stories

799
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
Stories behind them in the

800
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,072
People who made these objects

801
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,632
Because it tells you a lot about you know the region

802
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
And people live there

803
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
I mean since

804
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,008
They were a reaction

805
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,568
To the way that we travel

806
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,384
Embed we will be getting to bypass a lot of these towns

807
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,200
Kinecta came attractions for this reason

808
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,016
A Roadside Attraction continuing to evolve

809
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
As travel of all

810
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,624
It now and I I asked

811
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:15,744
I asked Nelson this question because you know we're not in like the rapid expansion

812
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Face

813
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,072
Petoskey decades

814
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:23,936
We've been doing air travel and with climate change what kind of more aware of

815
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
Carbon footprints

816
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:30,080
And also this Wednesday

817
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,896
Okay

818
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,712
World

819
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Largest

820
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
Ball of carbon

821
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
I asked her about this

822
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
Cuz I was kind of curious and

823
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,464
Still it's still a little bit of a question

824
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:53,120
I'm not sure yet I mean will there be a whole new set that surrounds Mass rail or

825
00:36:54,144 --> 00:37:00,288
Artwork in airports has really exploded to artwork is happens in that controlled environment

826
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,104
Attractions don't really have an inlet there yet

827
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,872
Because they're

828
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,408
You're so control

829
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
Will there be a

830
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,248
A slow version in cities that

831
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:13,088
It's just Alleyway embellishments at the new roadside is the sidewalk

832
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,880
A little tiny thing

833
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,952
To the next Starbucks

834
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,488
I think that that's

835
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
Right on the money

836
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:25,632
I mean it just because like there's all these types of little artistic

837
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,168
Interventions in Urban Land

838
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,240
Landscapes and maybe they've always been there I don't know if 8

839
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,312
A function as attractions exactly but

840
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,616
They are about embedding art

841
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:38,432
In the world in that seems like that impulses there

842
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,736
Airport

843
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,040
Yeah I travel a lot these days

844
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
And Airport Rd

845
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,952
Exhibits at SFO and accept in the mural

846
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,256
At the Oakland Airport

847
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
R destiny

848
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,816
I love

849
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,864
And I look forward to seeing them

850
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
For a while there was like

851
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
Old board game

852
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,240
I'm just like a exhibit of old board game

853
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,264
Games in SFO

854
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
End

855
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
I would totally stopping at Museum

856
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:10,944
I would if it was like on the side of the road in Kansas I totally would

857
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,224
Go to the Old Port

858
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,344
That's great I'm glad you didn't I

859
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,672
I'm really glad I didn't die to thank you for saying

860
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,976

861
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,512

00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,816
Version

863
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096

864
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,120
