Hey

29
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
I'm Roman Mars

30
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:39,584
I'm going to graduate school in Athens Georgia which is a great place to be from the 80s

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
Have about

32
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,144
18 to 25

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,192
If you like going out to bars

34
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
And listening to live music

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,544
You know Athens is a fairly small college town

36
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
It's hot

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128
Huge an important music scene for decades

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
In the most famous band to come out of the Athens scene

39
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,224
Undoubtably

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
Was REM

41
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,072
Be provocative right from the start I'm going to say that REM out of time

42
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:15,168
Is the most politically important album in the history of the United

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,728
Is reporter Whitney Jones

44
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
Do I have to say

45
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,872
I don't think at a time is even the most important album in the history of REM

46
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,688
Actually my argument here has nothing to do with the music

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,784
This isn't one of those oh it's a soundtrack to a generation or anything like that

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,856
Out of time made such a huge impact because of its

49
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Packaging

50
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:39,488
The box out of time originally came in led to a bill being passed in Congress

51
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,792
An actual concrete law

52
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
Let's go back to 1985

53
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
The pop charts were full of Prince

54
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
Sheena Easton

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
And the Youth of America

56
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
Or being corrupted

57
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:57,152
Tipper Gore in a few other Elite women of Washington form of the parents music Resource Center

58
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
Where the pmrc for short

59
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,040
They put pressure on the creators and Distributors of quote on quote

60
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
Objectionable music

61
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
Musicians and labels called the censorship

62
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
There were Senate hearings about this

63
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,536
And eventually those little black and white Parental Advisory sticker started appearing on albums

64
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
This set off a wave of sensors

65
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Step across the country

66
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,496
In 1990 a federal district judge in South Florida ruled that the rap group 2 Live Crew album

67
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
As nasty as they wanna be

68
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,640
Was so obscene that it couldn't be sold or performed within his jurisdiction

69
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,184
3 days after the ruling 2 Live Crew played a show in Broward County Florida

70
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,000
And after the show two members of the group got arrest

71
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
And it was a live performance

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,144
That they found obscene with you know girls doing what would be

73
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
Like what

74
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,752
Twerking I think it would be a very early version of the

75
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Twerking

76
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,872
Jeff ayeroff wasn't there he saw it on TV and I just it was just

77
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
So offensive

78
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Jeff was an executive at Virgin Records

79
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,784
And to be clear he wasn't offended by the raunchy lyrics or

80
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
The twerking

81
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
He was offended by the arrest

82
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,392
And a blatant censorship of the artist work

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,744
Just spend the next couple days mulling this over and then he had a revelation

84
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
One of the reasons why

85
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
Politicians get away with things

86
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
Because there isn't an anti constituent

87
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,191
There was never anything to lose by

88
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Baiting

89
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,543
Rock and roll because there was this

90
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
Canard that young people didn't vote

91
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,991
And you know within the next two days the idea came to me like fully formed in some way

92
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
And I came up with the

93
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
This damn Rock the vote

94
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
Progesterone

95
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
The idea behind rock the boat was simple

96
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,975
Get young people to vote for politicians who wouldn't censor music

97
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,279
That was that simple it was the idea of you put

98
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,071
Kids in the game

99
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
The game becomes differ

100
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,447
Politicians can no longer scapegoat music they can't keep

101
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
Keep using us as a

102
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Excuse

103
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,639
Jeffy Rap God about 60 people together in a Los Angeles hotel to talk about launching Rock the Boat

104
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
Frank Zappa was there

105
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,247
Past and present California Governor Jerry Brown was there

106
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
As we're a bunch of other record exec

107
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
So there we are

108
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Part of this

109
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
Virtuous circle of record executives

110
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,583
Who have spent a lot of their career being criticized for destroying the Youth of America and it was sort of like an affair

111
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
Very altruistic way

112
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,959
I think we could do something positive we can get kids to vote we can

113
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,543
It's cool also in attendance was Jeff's friend

114
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
Also record label executive

115
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Also named Jeff

116
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Jeff gold

117
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
He was working for Warner Brothers

118
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,479
And one of his major project of the time

119
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Was trying to figure out

120
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
How to package CDs

121
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,183
Compact disc packaging was the Hot Topic in the record world in the late eighties and early nineties

122
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
CDs have been around for a few years at this point

123
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
But record stores still didn't have a good way to display them

124
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,095
Here's Jeff gold

125
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
When

126
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
CDs first came out on the market

127
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,215
Record retailers

128
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
Were kind of angry about

129
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,079
Got them because their stores were formatted

130
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,383
To display

131
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,711
12 and 1/2 inch for 12 and 1/4 inch squares album

132
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,319
In other words they didn't have any stands or display cases for these new CDs

133
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,879
So somebody in the record industry said look

134
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:24,255
If you put a CD jewel case inside of a cardboard box that's as long as a vinyl album

135
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
And only half as wide

136
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
You can fit

137
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,911
Two of these longbox CDs side-by-side in an LP rack

138
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
Problem solved

139
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,007
Retailer set flying perfect

140
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,103
So millions of these things out of nowhere started getting made

141
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,687
Record people loved the long box

142
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
They thought it was the future

143
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:51,391
A head honcho at am I wrote this opinion piece in billboard magazine in 1989 entitled why we should

144
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
Keep the CD longbox

145
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
Your rights quote

146
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:00,863
I want to see the music industry continue to thrive and prosper as one of the cornerstones of entertainment

147
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,519
And I think making full use of the 6 by 12 CD carton is one way to help us do just that

148
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
But not everyone

149
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
Artist

150
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
I said wait a minute

151
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,687
We don't want you cutting down millions of

152
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Trees

153
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
To put

154
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
Are CD's in

155
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,575
And then having people throw these things away it's

156
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
Incredibly wasteful

157
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
And bad things

158
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
Because the thing about the longbox

159
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
Is that it was never meant to be collected

160
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
Had the feel of a big Mike and Ike

161
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
When you bought a CD in a longbox

162
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
You open it up

163
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
It take out the

164
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,239
The jewel case which had the actual CD in the album art in it

165
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
And you toss a long

166
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
There's no reason to keep it around

167
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,383
So Re Mi record coming out

168
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
In 1990

169
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
And they're saying

170
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,271
To me and to Warner Brothers there's no way our record

171
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Long box

172
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
We're sensitive to the environment

173
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,671
This is a ridiculous thing forget it

174
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
And where better sales Park

175
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Singing absolutely

176
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
Ask about a long box

177
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
Or record retailers

178
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
And that's when Jeff gold got this idea

179
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,191
He could merge the two projects He was working on

180
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,031
They could use the CD longbox to advance The Rock the vote camp

181
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,871
But first he needed a concrete political, so connected

182
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
And Jeff are all fat found just the thing

183
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,015
We were sitting there looking for a raise on death row to get us

184
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
Send a political situation

185
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
I'm reading this week

186
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
The time and there's this column article

187
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
About the Motor Voter bill

188
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
We just said

189
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,303
We're going to help these people from the Motor Voter bill

190
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,703
This was going to be our first thing we're going to do but so there's this Motor Voter bill that's been bouncing around Congress since the 1970s

191
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:46,079
If past

192
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:52,479
It also allowed you to register by mail or when you apply for social services like welfare or unemployment

193
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
Basically making it easier for lots of people

194
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
Including Rock living young people

195
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
The register to vote

196
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,695
By 91 a few States had already adopted it

197
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,511
But Congress has never been able to get it passed nationally

198
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,351
Jeff gold went to a political event in Hollywood about the Motor Voter bill

199
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,191
And one of the speakers was Columbia sociologist and political activist

200
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
Richard cloward

201
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,543
He said that writing to elected officials could help sway them on the issue

202
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,127
After clouds talk Jeff gold went up and spoke with

203
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
What happened I started

204
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,783
What amount of letters would a senator of Congress

205
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
Richmond take note of

206
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,391
650 200

207
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
That would really have an empath

208
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Really that

209
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Few

210
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
You said yeah that people don't write so

211
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,351
Getting 150-200 letters

212
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,679
About an issue would would definitely make them sit up in

213
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Take notice

214
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,775
That weekend Jeff gold was riding his bike around Santa Monica

215
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
Can I have this moment where

216
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,383
It rushed into my mind this fully formed idea that

217
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
We could

218
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
Take care of REM

219
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
By turning their long box into a positive

220
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,111
If we put a petition on the back of the long box

221
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,207
That would go to Rock the vote saying I support the Motor Voter bill

222
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
And we could distribute it to

223
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
Their respective senators

224
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
And I knew

225
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,655
We could generate an unbelievable amount of mail.

226
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,471
Jeff gold got on the phone with Jeff Tara

227
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,519
And they agreed that this would be the strategy

228
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,615
They would turn the album long box into a piece of political machinery

229
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,943
And they would flood congress with support for the Motor Voter bill

230
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,527
That Monday Jeff called Ariana's manager with the plan

231
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
It's alright Lily call the guys

232
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
I'll call you back

233
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
I probably heard back from him

234
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Within an hour

235
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,951
Bernie said great idea they're totally into it let's do it

236
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,535
So out of time hit the record stores on March 12th 1991

237
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,095
And then the petition started rolling in

238
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,911
Can I remember vividly

239
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
Beef for 5 days

240
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,495
After the record come out

241
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
I mean a very short period of time

242
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
And they had bags

243
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
It was really incredible

244
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,967
Nobody can seem to put their hand on what the exact number of

245
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,783
That we got of these were but I remember thinking

246
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:09,183
Well after 3 weeks we buy 10,000 I mean that's that's

247
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,999
Already half of what Richard cloward said would make an impact

248
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,607
And he sings just kept coming in and drove their canvas bags full of them coming in

249
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:23,775
About a month after REM release the album Rock the vote political director plus two members of the hip hop group KMD

250
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,895
Will the shopping cart full of these first ten thousand petitions into a senate hearing

251
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,479
And they just left them there for senators window Ford

252
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,783
And a very young looking Mitch McConnell

253
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
It may have 1992 after thousands of petitions and

254
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Senate testimony

255
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
The Motor Voter bill passed

256
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Congress

257
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
But then president HW Bush vetoed

258
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,863
This was in July right in the middle of Bush's re-election campaign

259
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,703
Bush's opponent Bill Clinton took up Motor Voter as a talking point

260
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Bashing Bush over here

261
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Is Vito

262
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
And the rest is basically history

263
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
Clinton wins 92

264
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:03,455
The bill comes back before the house is actually the second bill that the house takes up in January of 93

265
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
Motor Voter passed the house and passes the Senate

266
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
And then Bill Clinton signed it into law

267
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
As the national voter registration Act

268
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
1993

269
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,767
At the White House earlier today President Bill Clinton signed into law

270
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
The voter registration Act

271
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,863
Commonly referred to as the Motor Voter bill

272
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
Can we get invited to the White House

273
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
For the signing set

274
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
Totally surreal scene

275
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,543
His wife are there and I'm there

276
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
With my wife

277
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
All the people

278
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,711
Clinton at the signing talks about how Rock the vote really help to make the difference

279
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
To get this built

280
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
As I said I have

281
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
Long supported the idea of

282
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
Motor Voter

283
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
More than a year ago I promised

284
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Does president

285
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,975
But I would sign hr2 and fight for its Passage

286
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,047
I'm pleased to be able to keep the promise today

287
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
That I made on this rock

288
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
The vote card would still has my signature

289
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
Back in New Hampshire

290
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,311
Shaking his hands after the bill-signing we are gonna fight ourselves Rockville you said you guys got this past

291
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
It was really one of the most surreal

292
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
Moments of my life

293
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,367
I want to stop a Minit in point out just how bizarre this scene is

294
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:21,023
Remember Rock the vote had formed an open protest against the censorship group that was started by the new Vice

295
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
President's wife

296
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Tipper Gore

297
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:27,167
You know those little black and white parental advisory stickers those were nickname

298
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,751
Tipper Gore's husband was now praising Rock the vote

299
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,383
And it's a tribute to one group whose voice and organization was apps

300
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
Absolutely unprecedented

301
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
America's young people

302
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
They Rock the Boat

303
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
I got this time

304
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
Sew-in Jeff gold says

305
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Was really one of the most

306
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Surreal

307
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
Moments of my life

308
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,487
Yeah I think so real is probably the right word

309
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
What's interesting here is that this campaign

310
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,911
Really could have only happened during a very brief period of time

311
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,239
Because before Clinton that even signed the Motor Voter bill

312
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:06,079
Jeff gold at actually found a way to kill off the long box for good

313
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:11,455
He hatched a plan and he went to talk about it with the Chief Financial Officer at Warner Brothers

314
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Murrieta

315
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
It's Mari how many of these things do we make a year

316
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
I don't know 90 million between the

317
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Something like that

318
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
Niacin how much do they cost

319
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
$0.25

320
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
I said Okay so

321
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
You talking about

322
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,143
20 to 25 million dollars a year were music

323
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Expense on lombok

324
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
He said yeah

325
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
I said so what if we stopped making long box

326
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,895
And we took that 25 million dollars and gave it in the form of rebates

327
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Trek retailers

328
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,271
Just to pay for them to reconfigure

329
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
There been

330
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
And we did it as a one-time

331
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
Yo Discounters payment

332
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,511
And they got all the money we saved for the first year

333
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
And then

334
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
For the rest of time

335
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,399
We're saving 25 million dollars

336
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,519
A jackal tell that the other Warner Brothers Executives liked his idea

337
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
They took it to the distributor

338
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Distributor went for it

339
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,407
And that was the end of the long box

340
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,503
Some stores got new racks to accommodate the long box for Jewel cases

341
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
Others held onto their 12 inch bins

342
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,391
Started putting CDs inside of these reusable plastic

343
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
The cartridges

344
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,999
And record companies have been profitable and solvent ever since

345
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
So long boxes

346
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
The Motor Voter bill

347
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,423
Which after it passed became the national voter registration Act of 1993

348
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
That's still very much a thing

349
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,311
Between 1995 when the law went into effect in 2012

350
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,919
The percentage of the voting age population that is registered to vote went up more than 10 points

351
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,479
From 69.5%

352
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
279.9

353
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:55,903
And in that same time span more than a hundred and fifty million voter registrations have been filled out at the DMV

354
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,255
That doesn't even include mailing registrations or registrations through Social Services

355
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
As for what's the law also

356
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,911
So I think that proves it know album is as important to politics in the US

357
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
As REM out of time

358
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:14,079
But we lie their most important album important of other things that actually really matter

359
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Is murmur

360
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,711
Musically of course it's not their best album automatic for the people their best musical album

361
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
What how old are you

362
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
I'm 30

363
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
You're a child

364
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
You don't know anything

365
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
Murmur

366
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:56,831
We could go

367
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:03,231

368
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255

If you're fat

374
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:26,015
The reason I'm presenting the story again is that is nearly time to vote and I think that this election represents the most

375
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
Important we've ever had

376
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,647
Currently over 40% of the voting age population does not vote

377
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
And this is a

378
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Tragedy

379
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,279
That 40% and set the entire agenda for the whole country

380
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
And they don't

381
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
Some are systematically disenfranchised

382
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
And that is disgusting

383
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
The mini just don't vote for reasons that are mystery

384
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,311
Voting should not be viewed as an obligation

385
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
It is a joy

386
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,639
It makes you feel good

387
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431

Bongs and chatter of our devices

406
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,095
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
