Is a special joint episode between my friend here Roman Mars

27
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,304
It's election season as you know

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,656
And I found out we had a lot of the same questions about the political events

29
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,448
That are everywhere right now

30
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
Questions like

31
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,824
How much of a debate or a press conference is genuinely spontaneous

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
And how much is pre-planned

33
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,176
Who designed the theater of politics

34
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,248
Why do speeches in town hall meetings look the way they do

35
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,064
And what message are the campaign's trying to ask

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
With their design

37
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,648
Answer some of these questions

38
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,488
We tracked them to the most interesting people I've ever talked to

39
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
Solitaire

40
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,304
Let me ask them for their secret

41
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
Cigar number one

42
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
Every campaign has a brand

43
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:18,240
This is probably not a huge secret that anyone is paying close attention

44
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,336
It's more than just a politician himself as a brand is an abstraction that

45
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,408
Float on top of the human being that's running for office so

46
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,456
Obama in 2008 it was hope

47
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
And virami right now

48
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
I don't know I can't read

49
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Put my finger on it

50
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Tommy's brand is like a

51
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Competent

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
This man who can bring back jobs

53
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:42,048
That is the message that the campaign is selling and every detail is arranged the market that brand

54
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,888
The politicians clothes how he walks what he says where he goes

55
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
A sense of humor

56
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
His wife

57
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
His haircut

58
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
His watch

59
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,056
Which brings us to secret number

60
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
2

61
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616
Every campaign has a

62
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
Team of people

63
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
Who are in charge of making every event

64
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Fit that brand

65
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
The called the advanced

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Team

67
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,600
From campaign headquarters

68
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
They're giving a location

69
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Update

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
A type of event

71
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,864
Donnie Fowler is a longtime Advanced guy he worked for Bill Clinton Al Gore John

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
Scary Barack Obama

73
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
Very much Democrat

74
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,616
And Fowler says that for every campaign event there's something you have to have on the stage

75
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
But it's a different thing in every place

76
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
Whether it's the flag

77
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,016
And I with a hay bale or

78
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,832
Nicole matter standing behind you in Ohio

79
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,904
Orange Beach Florida

80
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,952
The Naval Yard here in Virginia

81
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
So you want local color

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
You want sound of America

83
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
Americana

84
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
And you won't real people

85
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
The keys

86
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,192
She says is making the event look genuine

87
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,496
The politician look more human

88
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
Included relating to

89
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
Regular mirror

90
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,360
So you rarely are going to see

91
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
Even Mitt Romney

92
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,992
In front of a boardroom with a bunch of white guys in blue suits and red ties

93
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,600
His background to his benefit

94
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
To his credit

95
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,440
Is from the corporate Barbarian

96
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,536
That's not the kind of images you want to choose when you're when you're running for president

97
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,375
John Seaton a republican Advance guy agrees

98
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
Having a bail of hay or corn references

99
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Something like that

100
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Kind of gives

101
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
Clear the air

102
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
Somewhere awesome

103
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,711
Here in Iowa

104
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
Seton work

105
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,295
Republicans like John McCain

106
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087
Sarah Palin Tim pawlenty

107
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,391
Injustice secret number 3

108
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,975
The advancing to run their campaigns pretty much the same way

109
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
Summer better funded than others

110
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:54,143
But they're all doing the same thing marketing their brand Day by Day event by event

111
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Fowler says the advanced team

112
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,519
Flies into the event location a week or more

113
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
Before a speech

114
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Torelli

115
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,895
20-minute event requires several dozen people

116
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
Campaign staff

117
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Secret Service

118
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,551
They start from zero and work hundreds and hundreds of hours

119
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
Put together what might be that

120
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
20 minute campaign stop

121
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,255
The advance team is responsible for the staging of the event from the flowers to the backdrop

122
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
To the security and the audience

123
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,887
The first big decision is where to have the event

124
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
And that's the Feller can

125
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,215
So easily go wrong

126
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Like in 2004

127
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:36,127
When John Kerry went to the key primary state of South Carolina to announce his

128
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Candidacy

129
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,271
Pictures of Vietnam war hero and he gave his speech before the USS Yorktown

130
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:48,415
A massive aircraft carrier did the time seemed like a good idea

131
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
It's not fair

132
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
The crowd was Tiny

133
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,791
Especially in front of a huge aircraft carrier

134
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
And fair

135
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
Once and for all

136
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
Is a big lesson in this one

137
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
The Statler

138
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,895
Don't put the candidates in a situation where he looks diminished

139
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
You can't build a crowd

140
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,343
Economic speech this year where he put it in a football stadium

141
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
About the economy

142
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
I want to take the folks at 3 at Ford Field

143
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,023
After making this a space available for us I guess we had a hard time finding a

144
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
Large enough place to meet and this

145
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Certainly is

146
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
The Republican Advance guy Seaton

147
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,751
Also talked about that Romney speech and he too says

148
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
Choosing a venue that

149
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
Two large

150
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
Can be disastrous

151
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
Immediately

152
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
Texas stadium

153
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,503
People tweeting and blogging about how

154
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
Support in this County because

155
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
Venue is

156
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
And then remember those week

157
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
The Plaza

158
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,327
The cameras pan of the empty Stadium will be played over

159
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Over

160
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
And over again

161
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,215
Romney's campaign couldn't even fill all the chairs

162
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
In the audience

163
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,591
Secret number for is a corollary today

164
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,151
Every campaign these days send out

165
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
Spies I guess you

166
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,247
You could call them to every one of their opponents

167
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,807
In politics they're called trackers

168
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
Sissy

169
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,671
Gentilini motors have trackers from the other campaigns

170
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,559
Here's the half Secret

171
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
Advance staff

172
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
One candidate

173
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Robin becomes

174
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,959
Friendly with the trackers of their opponent

175
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,823
I mean hey there in the same line of work

176
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
If each other

177
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
They're like

178
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
Well

179
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
Better luck next time

180
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Timeout

181
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
Oh Sherrie

182
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
You can't win them all you know

183
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Thanks

184
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
Nice day outside

185
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
To be alive

186
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
Secret number 5

187
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
Everything

188
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
Is staged

189
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
I cannot

190
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Stress this enough

191
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,191
And the longer in advance an event is planned

192
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,007
The more granular that staging become

193
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Take the debates

194
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
The Statler

195
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,663
So here's what you're seeing is not an extemporaneous debate

196
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Between two

197
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
Very smart people

198
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
No it didn't

199
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
Credibly

200
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
Finally staged

201
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Theater

202
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,647
Every little detail about that stage how they're standing

203
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Is it

204
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
Litigated really

205
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
And if you watch carefully Sisseton

206
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,119
You can tell look at how the candidates

207
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,983
Each other what they're doing when the other person's talking

208
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
Then there are the convention

209
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,663
Also incredible dramaturgical feet

210
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,967
From the message of the speeches

211
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
The timing of the balloon drop

212
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,319
Even the chance of the crowd

213
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
The teams so spontaneous

214
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
Completely pre-planned

215
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
The campaign staff

216
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,959
Seton says each section of the convention floor have a campaign

217
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
Who receives instructions

218
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
Passed down from a central planner

219
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,663
And the website make sure that their sections are her chanting appropriately

220
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,991
Because left to their own devices a big group can become a big

221
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:30,623
Stupid mop like at the Republican convention this year when a bunch of people started chanting the USA

222
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,207
Preventing the committeewoman from Puerto Rico from taking money

223
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,911
Which actually brings us to secret number 6

224
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,495
No matter how carefully the Advance Team plan

225
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,823
Campaign events can and do go wrong

226
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
The biggest

227
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Screw-ups

228
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
Acetin

229
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
Are totally self-inflict

230
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,223
I think everyone remembers

231
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Turkey's being

232
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,927
It was supposed to be a pardoning of a Thanksgiving turkey

233
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
Palin's attempt to do a

234
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
Presidential event

235
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:14,655
But when she took questions from reporters she stood right in front of a slaughtering table

236
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,007
I was happy to get to be invited to 4

237
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
Participate in Miss

238
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
Panda

239
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
Behind her right now

240
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
Man is hoisting live turkeys

241
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
Into a cone

242
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
So he can slip their neck

243
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
Bleed them to death

244
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
You see this happening and

245
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
And it's just like

246
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
IFit overlap

247
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,631
Donnie Fowler remembers a fancy fundraiser for Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign

248
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,471
Harvey Weinstein Paul Newman

249
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
Big fundraiser in Connecticut

250
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
And I was in charge of telling

251
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:58,431
Paul Newman Harvey Weinstein

252
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
Any my little earpiece

253
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
I heard

254
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
Where are you in the program

255
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
We are on our way

256
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,903
So I went to mr. Weinstein

257
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,975
It's time for you to go into this present into the room

258
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,351
Play Stand Up and they say how happy they are to be there and they say will you please stand up

259
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Welcome

260
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,471
President Clinton's the room the doors in the back of the room open

261
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
Spotlight

262
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,055
The doors

263
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
Walk energy

264
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,623
He wants to look at me from the stage like what the heck is going on man

265
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,999
Tyler realize the wrong person have been

266
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
Talking in his ear piece

267
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,839
Let's get started we're on our way

268
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
He thought it was

269
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
Clinton's Handler

270
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
But it had been

271
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
Kenny G's

272
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,775
And that brings us to secret number 7

273
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:02,175
Everyone traveling with a campaign the advanced team that handlers probably even the candidate ends up loading

274
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:08,575
The music so do the reporters

275
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,439
We love America pop songs that every candidate has

276
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,279
Pain in the neck

277
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,143
God just makes me ill

278
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,751
Sometimes it's rock and roll sometimes it's country but it's inevitably

279
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Fun upbeat pop songs

280
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,871
But you come to the stage and you leave the stage and workable plan with two

281
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,735
Sometimes got this song Only in America that makes hissing used by

282
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,807
Book party since President Bush in 2004

283
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
Patriotic mix

284
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
Growler both of them

285
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,655
Serious Political Animals

286
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
Told us they do not miss that

287
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
We on for years

288
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,823
So Seton Fowler I can't remember who's the Republican and who's the Democrat

289
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Doesn't matter

290
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Putting on

291
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
Same show

We are project kalw NAIA San Francisco

294
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,727
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

295
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
We're immersed

296
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,311
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

297
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
If

298
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:40,735
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

299
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:46,367
Technology talk to us

300
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
It is a creation of Sonic trash

301
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,743
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

302
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,327
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

303
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
To make them more human

304
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Turn the living room lights on

305
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
Okay

306
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
Dim the living room lights to 50%

307
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Okay

308
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:13,759
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

309
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,063
Makes for a much more natural

310
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Experience

311
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
Turn the living room lights on

312
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
Dim the living room lights to 50%

313
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,423
