If you've ever seen an episode of the TV show The West Wing

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,424
You probably know what

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
Its trademark seeds

28
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240

I don't even know where I am right now I'm working on this side

00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,016

Talking about some government policy or

Plot point

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,696
The dialogue isn't Messi

Sara Lee exciting on its own

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,144
But at a little motion and you've got some compelling freaking television

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
From now on

41
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
Maybe our only hope

42
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,264
I don't know why they made the Oval Office a special shape

43
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,824
But if you want to view episodes you might notice some

44
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,384
The characters almost never look at each other

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,528
They mostly look straight ahead is a good reason for this location

46
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
We use our eyes to navigate

47
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
We use our ears to listen

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
But that doesn't work if your deaf

49
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,720
That's our reporter today Tom dries

50
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,072
He went to gallaudet University in Washington DC to talk to a researcher

51
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
And Robert service

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,216
Gallaudet is the only University in the world designed entirely for the Deaf

53
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
And hard-of-hearing

54
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:55,616
Robert is death himself and he's been looking into this question of how deaf people walk in

55
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Inside

56
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
He told me about his latest pics

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
So I'm doing at the

58
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:05,344
Comparative study between people who are speaking walking along H Street

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,648
Yeah that's actually the voice of Carolyn wrestler

60
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
She's an interpreter I

61
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
Gary Oldman

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
So I'm doing it

63
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,584
Comparative study between people who are speaking walking along H Street

64
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,448
And walking together speaking to one another so to hearing dyads with the same kind of

65
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
Camera on their head

66
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
And then to death

67
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
Dietitian

68
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,152
Fancy term in sociology for a pair of people

69
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,968
So Robert put cameras on these two pairs of

70
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,016
People hearing and deaf

71
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
He had them walk down the street

72
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
And he did this

73
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
So we could put

74
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
Precisely monitor whooped

75
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
People look at when they walk

76
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Can tok

77
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
Verses when they walk in sign

78
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,768
You sound very clear differences

79
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,840
Securing people look straight ahead the whole time they were walking

80
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
You might see just a few

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,960
It's very rare seconds when the person would look at the other

82
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,752
Person who they were walking beside and speaking

83
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,056
If they wouldn't ever make eye contact when we look at the

84
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,384
Pause what's up people there was a continuous maintained icon

85
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,736
So because American sign language is a visual language

86
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
It requires constant

87
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
Eye contact

88
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
But maintain eye contact also mean

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
You can't pay full attention

90
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Zenni Optical

91
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
Close up ahead and that's a problem if your walk

92
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,536
I mean I guess if you can think about yourself as a person you can hear

93
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:24,191
If you weren't looking at the road as you were driving and looking at your passenger it was your driving down the road you can imagine how difficult

94
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
That might be the mediator

95
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,263
Your car down the road will the same kind of things happen

96
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,823
Deaf people but we watch out for one another

97
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:34,943
For walking and signing to work the people holding a conversation need to keep an eye out for optical

98
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,295
But it's not like deaf people make a deal at the beginning of a conversation

99
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
You talk I'll be the lookout

100
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:47,487
When deaf people look at one another there's an agreement and internal agreement unspoken agreement that's understood between the two

101
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Conversing

102
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
That was like the people

103
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
When you're in a conversation you're in a kind of dance

104
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
We are not

105
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
Discussing what's happening between each other

106
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
But you just sort of know what the neck

107
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Move should be

108
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
That's exactly it

109
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,687
When you're dancing you kind of work with your partner in the way they breathe the way they move their body and you respond accordingly the same thing

110
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
Conversation

111
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:13,599
When they're designing buildings post-hearing Architects are not thinking about providing a venue

112
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
For this dance

113
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:19,231
Robert says a lot of spaces are too narrow and confining for a good cover

114
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
There's this sense that

115
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,863
Buildings were not designed in such a way that they accommodate def

116
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
People so how does that feel I guess

117
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
The best way to say that is like weave

118
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
Feel like sardines

119
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
You know like we're all lined up one after the next

120
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
Converse in that way in

121
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
There's no he's in Arkham

122
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,455
Haitian actually also true of many buildings at gallaudet University

123
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,783
Even though it's dedicated to teaching the deaf and hard-of-hearing

124
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:48,159
It's a relatively old campus a lot of buildings were built in the mid-1800s

125
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,743
And it looks like a typical Northeastern liberal arts college

126
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
But there are signs

127
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
The school is different than your West

128
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Senior Amherst

129
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,655
Mister whatever take for example the doorbells on campus

130
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:05,567
Nowadays people use lights you can flick a light switch and let somebody know that you're at the door but in the 1800

131
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,383
Dreads before electric light that use the vibration

132
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
The university has a display of an old doorbell it's about 4 feet high with a round metal handle attached to a chain

133
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,367
And at the other end of that chain is a lead weight

134
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
It arrived at the door

135
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
And you'd simply pull the chain

136
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
With that

137
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
Hit to the floor

138
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
When we're listening to the chain

139
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
But that hit to the floor

140
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
You'd meaning

141
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Italy get it coming

142
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
The tunsel Bauman

143
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,383
He's now the director of design and planning at gallaudet Bauman is not dead

144
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
And in this case that is his

145
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,527
And this was one of the really cool but kind of anachronistic Innovations at gallaudet

146
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,159
Several years ago the university realize that some of its standards of architecture and innovation

147
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
At slipped

148
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
So the ass handle to help lead a group

149
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:59,071
Project that would rethink the campus design with deaf people in mind

150
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
They called the projects

151
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Death space

152
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
Death space really

153
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,727
Started at the beginning of time whenever there

154
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
Are deaf people there is

155
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
This idea of death space

156
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:14,431
Deaf people have sensibilities of adapting their world tour their way of being

157
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,783
The campus took those ideas and poured them into the design of a new building

158
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,855
Call the Sorenson language and communication

159
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
But everyone calls it the SLCC

160
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,463
It was built in 2008

161
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,511
And also working on a new door

162
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
Hansel Bauman showed me around

163
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,631
And I saw that there are a lot of little innovation

164
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,215
Some that come to mind immediately like the type of doors

165
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:42,079
If you're walking and signing a normal door will stop your conversation cold

166
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
United sweet

167
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,991
Just passed through two sliding doors

168
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,599
The sliding doors are purposely designed to allow people to continue

169
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,439
A signed conversation as they enter the building so you don't stop

170
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
Open the door

171
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
Start the conversation again

172
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
And then there are more subtle changes

173
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,655
One of the big Ideas behind if space is avoiding eye strain

174
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,727
That's because when you communicate all day with your eyes it's

175
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Easy to get tired

176
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
So if you have bad lighting

177
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,383
Conditions for example which is backlighting glare

178
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
High contrast between dark spaces

179
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
And white spaces

180
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,807
Air conditions in the environment which individually vibrate

181
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
Like if you have horizontal lines and

182
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
For the blind

183
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,415
You'll start getting vibration

184
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
All those annoyances in of themselves

185
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,327
May not be so bad but taken together over the time of a day

186
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
It's beginning of eye strain

187
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
And I strain really wears people out

188
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
Basically

189
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
I've actually noticed that myself like when I look at horizontal blinds and get that sort of eye vibration

190
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
And I thought I was just

191
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,687
Weird I don't think you're weird Tom

192
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,247
So the Sorenson building avoids those traps

193
00:08:54,015 --> 00:09:00,159
It has enormous windows in a lot of diffuse light to reduce Shadows while you have some direct light coming on

194
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
It's still

195
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
Can filled with this diffuse quality of life

196
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,815
There's really not a lot of Shadows on the

197
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Face

198
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,167
There's not a lot of distraction on surfaces behind us

199
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,263
And when we walked by a classroom Hanzo pointed inside at the color scheme

200
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:20,639
The color of the blue classroom that's a color we've been experimenting with his is a good

201
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
Contrast the range of skin tones

202
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,503
You can so clearly see

203
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,599
Sign language in there in that room better when you say you can the next door

204
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
Not all of the changes worked

205
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,487
In the building's design they decided to round off sharp corners

206
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
That's because if you can't hear footsteps from around the corner

207
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,631
A lot of times you won't know someone's coming at all

208
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
If people bump into each other

209
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
So they rounded off these

210
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
Again a lesson learned we didn't we realize

211
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
Two people now hug that

212
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
Curved corner like a race car

213
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
Can you still kind of have that problem

214
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,735
So our strategy now is to create glass corners

215
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,831
It allow you to kind of see through the corner but it still extend that.

216
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Time

217
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
I think you have the

218
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Before you get to

219
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,231
The building is definitely Pleasant to look at

220
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,047
The color scheme is nice the lightest pleasing

221
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
But as someone who can hear

222
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,167
Probably would not have noticed a lot of these little changes if

223
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
Hanzo hadn't pointed them out

224
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:22,335
But after walking around with Hanzo the most striking thing about the building was the level of

225
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Thoughtfulness

226
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,711
Everything in the building seems to have a specific thought behind it

227
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:32,575
Chairs are on Wheels so you can constantly rearrange them in circles

228
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
And they made benches out of wood

229
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,695
Because you can feel vibrations more easily Through the Wood

230
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
And they try to

231
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,535
Strategically place air conditioning units

232
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
So they don't make as much noise

233
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,655
That's because it turns out that hearing aids can pick up that sound

234
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
A really jarring way

235
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,263
And for honzel working on deafspace Hazmat

236
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
Becoming sensitive

237
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,591
To arrange of issues that you never thought of before

238
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
I think

239
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
The

240
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,687
The window that

241
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
The death experience

242
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
First architect

243
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,343
Is to provide us with a new kind of awareness around

244
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,135
What's working and what's not working

245
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
In a row

246
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
That we might accept

247
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
Everyday is

248
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Just kind of our condition

249
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
We're not aware of it

250
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
It's not

251
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
In front of us in a way that we can

252
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
Name

253
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,679
What's the aggravation in the room where the environment

254
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Strasser

255
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
We don't have a way to recognize

256
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,543
I think it's part of everyday death

257
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Experience

258
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,663
That's why everyone involved in the death Space Project says it is not just

259
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
For deaf people

260
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,735
Fundamentally this is about Universal

261
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,039
Designing to the widest range of people

262
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
Possible with a variety of a

263
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Because

264
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
Not only is it more inclusive

265
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
The monster we better design

266
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Regardless of

267
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,535
When oxo and smart design collaborated on make

268
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,583
Potato peeler for people with

269
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
Arthritis

270
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,167
They created a nuclear with an ergonomic

271
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Bat

272
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
Black analysts turn out to be better for everyone

273
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
Now you see that application

274
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
Designing for the Deaf

275
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
Maybe more subtle but if we mitigate eye strain

276
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Hearing aid interference

277
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Air conditioners

278
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
There's no telling how much better everyone's

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

300
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,375
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

301
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,703
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

302
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
We're looking the part

303
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
Might cost you your life

304
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:37,151
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

305
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:41,503
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

306
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,855
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

307
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,207
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

308
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,559
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

309
00:13:54,815 --> 00:14:00,959
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action

310
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
A movie called Immortal cop

311
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
Was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

312
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:15,039
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it now I need to

313
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
To clear my name

314
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:22,719
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
