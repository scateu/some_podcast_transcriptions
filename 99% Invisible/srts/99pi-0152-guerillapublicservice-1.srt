22

This is 99% invisible

23
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
At some point in your life you probably encountered a problem in the built world something that was poorly designed and the

25
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,104
The fix was obvious to you

26
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,712
Maybe a door that open the wrong way or a poorly painted marker on the road

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,576
I know this is kind of stuff all the time even more so now after creating the show

28
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm sorry if you do too because you listen to this show

29
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
And mostly when we see these things

30
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,256
Weed crumble on the inside

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
Do nothing

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,864
There are all sorts of reasons for inertia

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
We don't know how to fix it

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,216
It's not ours to fix we could get in trouble

35
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,008
That's producer David Weinberg

36
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,336
You might notice these little design flaws for years

37
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,408
Silently fuming until

38
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
One day

39
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
He called me and said

40
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
NOK we're doing it

41
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,344
It was early Sunday morning

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
August 5th

43
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672
2001 Los Angeles Califor

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,024
Richard ankrom and a group of friends were on the 4th Street Bridge

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
Over the 110

46
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
Freeway

47
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
They were about to commit

48
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,680
Give me a high-profile dangerous situation

49
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:20,032
Natalie can I get arrested I could kill somebody really I was terrified of that

50
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
But let's back up

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
About 20 years prior

52
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,480
Richard ankrom an artist living in Orange County was driving north on the 110 freeway

53
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
Is he passed through downtown Los Angeles

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,112
He was going to merge onto another freeway to I-5 North

55
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
But he missed the exit got lost

56
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
And for some reason

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
It just stuck

58
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
Years later when Richard move to downtown Los Angeles he was driving on the same stretch of freeway where he got lost today

59
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
Decade before

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,568
We looked up at the Big Green rectangular sign suspended above I realize why I missed the exit

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
It's because it wasn't

62
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
Adequately signed

63
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
Bad wayfinding

64
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,272
The exit for the I-5 wasn't indicated on the green overhead sign

65
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
There was even a big open

66
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,392
Space weather should have been a blue and red Interstate Shield

67
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
And above that

68
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
It should have said north

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
It was clear to Richard

70
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Caltrain

71
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
The California Department of Transportation

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
I made a mistake

73
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,520
Sir Richard and artist and sign painter decided to make the Interstate 5 North Shield himself and install it in the

74
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,336
The place he thought it should have been all along

75
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
High above the 110 freeway

76
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,456
He would call it an act of Guerrilla public service

77
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
All I do is to be

78
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
Certified public servant

79
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Bored

80
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
Roxy to show

81
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
What you can do with artwork

82
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:43,488
You can put in plain sight have a functioning working thing for everyone to use

83
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,584
Richard started by studying LA freeway sign

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
Holding up Pantone swatches

85
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,680
Perfectly match the paint color

86
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,776
He dangled over Bridges to measure the exact dimensions of other sign

87
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
And most importantly

88
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,384
He downloaded the Necronomicon of

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,432
California road signage

90
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
The Mad kid

91
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:09,600
The mutcd the manual on uniform traffic control devices

92
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Quotes

93
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,512
To provide for uniform standards and specifications for all official traffic-control devices in California

94
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,559
It's not a beach read

95
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,143
I have a horrible Lazy Sunday Afternoon read

96
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,215
All the specs are online so

97
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
People can

98
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
Bid on

99
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
Projects

100
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
Richard wanted his sign

101
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
To be built to the exact specifications

102
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Caltrans

103
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,199
Which were designed to be read by motorists

104
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
Traveling at high

105
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
The

106
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
Shield with a v on it

107
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
3 ft

108
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
Roughly High

109
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
WYD

110
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,463
It's less than 1/8 of an inch barely needs

111
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Stick woman

112
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
It's still pretty strong

113
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
And above that I put the word North

114
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,167
And that was all about 14 in by 5

115
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,519
And again I use the same typeface that was there in the same signs

116
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
The tried to match everything

117
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,359
Close as I could so it wouldn't be obvious

118
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
Caltrans didn't do it

119
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
Richard's brand new edition

120
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
Had to blend in

121
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
Perfectly with

122
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
The existing signage

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
Which have been collecting dirt and smog

124
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
For decades

125
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,903
I sprayed the whole thing with a really thin glaze

126
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Gray

127
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
The knockdown

128
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,535
After he finished it Richard sign his name on the back of it

129
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
The black marker

130
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
Painter signing a

131
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Canvas

132
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,423
Then came the next phase of the project

133
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
The installation

134
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
Cheap land

135
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
Decision of a bank

136
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
He bought a disguise

137
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
A white hard hat and an orange vest

138
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:41,247
So he'd look like a Caltrans worker basically looked at partes as best I could

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,599
Animal decal for a pickup truck meant to look vaguely official that said

140
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
Aesthetic deconstruction

141
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,207
The night before the installation

142
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
Richard drove out to the site

143
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Hit some of his

144
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,071
Supplies to the BET to get to the next morning

145
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
My interview.

146
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
He took me to the spot

147
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Show me

148
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,751
Stashed his stuff okay we're basically here

149
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,103
Right now the ivy isn't that fit but it was a lot thicker and I had

150
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,455
Basically behind that trade stashed the ladder and the signs and stuff

151
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
After he hit his things

152
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,783
Climbed a tree

153
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Going through everything

154
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,719
I just heard a call myself down by being there and hanging around with it tonight

155
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
4

156
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,791
Richard was worried that he might drop

157
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
The sign

158
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Or one of his

159
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
Tools part of the road below

160
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
Drivers going 60

161
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
Plus miles an hour would have no time to react

162
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
If something landed on the road in front of them

163
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Or worse

164
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Onto their car

165
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
That was a scary

166
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
Thing about hope

167
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
If somebody got hurt

168
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
Apple ID with that

169
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,295
And then the project that after scan it cuz

170
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
It would have defeated the whole

171
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Idea

172
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
But despite some reservations

173
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439
Richard was pretty confident

174
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Call the Whole Thing Off

175
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
And he gone too far to turn back

176
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,399
And that brings us back to the morning of August 5th 2001

177
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,311
Richard did not act alone he asked several friends to film the insulation from different Vantage points

178
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,151
Amy inoue was one of the friends he Enlisted the film

179
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,967
6 a.m. or 7 a.m. on Sunday morning

180
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
It was 10

181
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,295
Because we all thought we were going

182
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:27,487
Richard had chosen the Sunday morning to put up the sign knowing that there would be little traffic and The Morning Light Rising

183
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,815
In about the skyscrapers would be just right for filming

184
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,471
What he hadn't anticipated was that couch ranted also picked that morning to do work on the same stretch

185
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,543
Yes they happen to be doing some other work

186
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
On the freeway

187
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Just salad

188
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
That's fine

189
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,919
When they saw the Caltrans workers

190
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
They thought about turning back

191
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
But I had surmised after all this is

192
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
It's pretty large city there be more than one sign

193
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,879
My assumption was that think the other guy was

194
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Richard Park his truck

195
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,231
When everyone was in position with their cameras

196
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
He went to work

197
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,559
The hardest part was getting over the razor wire

198
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
With the ladder

199
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
Once he was up on the catwalk

200
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,167
Delete 30 ft above the highway

201
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,215
You started screwing in the new sign

202
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
Careful not to drop any screws

203
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
On the cars below

204
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
Halfway into it

205
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
We just

206
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
Don't like okay he's going to get away with

207
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:24,831
Amazing or what

208
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
The whole thing took less than

209
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
30 minute

210
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
As soon as it was up

211
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,999
Richard pack up his letter rushed back to his truck

212
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:37,887
Blended back into the city

213
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
I think we all went out to

214
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
Super relieved

215
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,943
Only a small group of people knew that the Interstate 5 shield with the word North hanging above the 110 freeway

216
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
Was it forgery

217
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
He didn't say to us.

218
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
Don't tell anyone

219
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
So are

220
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
Friends on new whip

221
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Happy

222
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
But it never

223
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Tweaked-out

224
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,119
For a while

225
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
For a while

226
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,983
For nine months the secret stayed within a small community

227
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
And then Richard sprengeri

228
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
Repeat the story

229
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:22,943
What the hell Gary why can't you be cool just be cool Gary Richard Secret

230
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
Without the Caltrans

231
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:31,135
And the Press from the fake magnetic sign on his beat up blue truck to a work order proclaiming rush

232
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,535
But he did is against the law to capture and says it has no plans at all to file charges against him actually found out what

233
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,095
What happened apparently they send a crew out there to inspect

234
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,935
Richard was hoping to get it signed back from Caltrans after they took it down

235
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:50,079
He was thinking he would hang it in an art gallery but Caltrans didn't take the sign down at past

236
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:54,175
The Caltrans inspection cuz that's really that the final

237
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,991
Cast of how am I how good the artwork is

238
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,039
It stayed up for 8 years

239
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
9 months and

240
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
14 days I believe

241
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
It's not exactly a coup

242
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Pretty close to that

243
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
An interviews about the incident with other news organizations

244
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
Caltrans didn't exactly

245
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
Condone rich

246
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Handiwork

247
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,655
They're pretty kind about it

248
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,519
Here's the Caltrans spokesperson at a time

249
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,359
And in fact you did such a good job that I'd like to offer him a job application

250
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:29,759
More than eight years after Richard son when he got a call from a friend who noticed some workers taking it down

251
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,879
Richard contacted Caltrans to ask if he can have his signed back by time I tracked him down

252
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,183
It already been crushed into a bale

253
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
Going for China

254
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,023
Who knows what it turned into could be a waffle iron by now

255
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
After Caltrans took down Richard

256
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
Consign they replaced it with a brand new one

257
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
But this time

258
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,263
They Incorporated his ideas into the new design

259
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,591
They out of the 5 north and the shield not only

260
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
That's fine

261
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,919
But the two additional one up the road

262
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
A little epilogue

263
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,183
Richard's highway sign is a happily Ever After Story the sign worked

264
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,255
People appreciated it no one got hurt thankfully

265
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
Even Caltrans was

266
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
Really pretty nice about the whole thing

267
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,679
There's another gorilla sign story out of New York City a group that calls itself

268
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,031
The efficient passenger project has been hanging signs in New York subway station

269
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
To tell people

270
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,895
Where they can board the train to make the most efficient transfers

271
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,247
The project is not at all affiliated with the Metropolitan Transit Authority

272
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
But the signs look just like MTA signs

273
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,111
Black with white helvetica lettering

274
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
They say things like

275
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,719
Bored here for best transfer to the 4 5 and 6 trains

276
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,023
Or board here for best transfer

277
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
F&M train

278
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,703
It's the kind of knowledge that you build up over time as a regular Subway Rider and this gorilla sign maker is offering

279
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Bring it to everyone

280
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
I know some of the plot of the signs

281
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
Not all New Yorkers

282
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,383
Are pleased these are secrets some say

283
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,735
That people should have to earn they will unbalanced the cars they say

284
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
Leave signage to The Experts

285
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
The MTA for their part

286
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,647
Is taking down the signs as fast as they go up

287
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz

288
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
Toeless in an email that quote

289
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
Posting of the signs

290
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
Is considered an act

291
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Vandalism

292
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:28,287
Point being if you decide to undertake an act of gorilla Public Service just know it mean

293
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:01,311

Between the beats

297
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,791
Bongs and chatter of our devices

298
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,375
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

299
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
If

300
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799

304
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
It is a creation of Sonic trash

305
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

306
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,391
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

307
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,439
To make them more human

308
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
Turn the living room lights on

309
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Okay

310
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,631
Dim the living room lights to 50%

311
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Okay

312
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:05,823
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

313
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
Mix

314
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127

Turn the living room lights on

317
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

347
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,535
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

348
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,863
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

349
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
A dad

350
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,239
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

351
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
Actually if I'm being honest

352
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

353
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:20,991
I think a few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an act

Was found dead in my private gym

356

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had some

357
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
Nothing to do with it

358
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
Now

359
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
I need to clear my name

360
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:42,751
