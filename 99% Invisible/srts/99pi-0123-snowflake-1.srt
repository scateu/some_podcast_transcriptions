I'm Roman Mars

26
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:36,000
Since the early 1500s when Sir Thomas More coin the word Utopia

27
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
Probably well before then

28
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
People have been thinking about

29
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,888
How to design their ideal Society

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,192
Maybe it's one that doesn't use money

31
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,216
One that

32
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,288
Drops the traditional family structure in favor of

33
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
Raising children collectively

34
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896
1 to check

35
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,760
That's producer Delaney Hall getting ready to visit a sort of utopia

36
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,064
And before she left she packed her bag

37
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
Tested her recording equipment

38
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,440
Grab a few extra packs of double a batteries and

39
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
I'm just going to fill up

40
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,816
Selected tab of water

41
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,680
And then thoroughly washed every item of clothing that she was bringing with her

42
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
Have a

43
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,008
Box of baking soda

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
Dumping some of it in this

45
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
Tub of water

46
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:27,456
Be more specific I soaked my clothes in a tub of baking soda for 48 hours

47
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,040
Showered with dr. Bronner's unscented soap for 2 weeks

48
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Before I left

49
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,160
Old pair of jeans and putting them into

50
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,560
Delaney reports for the show state of the reunions every episode is about a different place so she travels a lot

51
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,400
But she doesn't usually go to these kinds of extremes to get ready

52
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,728
But this is an unusual reporting trip I'm about to go on

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,312
I'm headed to an isolated community in Eastern Arizona

54
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,128
On the outskirts of a small town called snowflake

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,248
And the people who live there have given me very special instructions for how to get ready

56
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,296
Because for some people in Snowflake

57
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,368
Utopia just means not being physically sick

58
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,976
Community people who live just outside the small rural town

59
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
The medical condition called MCS multiple chemical sensitivity

60
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
Intolerant to laundry detergent perfume cigarette smoke car exhaust commercial cleaning products

61
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:30,176
Community designed around keeping that sort of stuff out people who have NCS can be seriously affected

62
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:36,576
Sometimes disabled by migraines muscle pain rashes nausea and fatigue

63
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,976
Studies have not shown a strong connection between chemical exposures and symptoms there's no real medical consensus

64
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:49,376
About what causes the illness and doctors disagree about whether symptoms are physiological psychological

65
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
Or both that means that people with MCS are often dismissed as well hypochondriacs

66
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:02,176
How do you find themselves without sympathetic Medical Care access to services that people with recognized disabilities

67
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
There are a subset of doctors who believe in MCS and treat it but most mainstream sza

68
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,464
Additions avoid the diagnosis and so a lot of people with the illness fall back on trial and error

69
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,536
Designing their diets habits and environment

70
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,583
Try and make themselves feel better

71
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
My first morning in Snowflake and this is really an incredible landscape very flat

72
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,735
Very dry you can see a long way in every direction and sky is very

73
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:43,135
The house is out here all built-in really simple Style

74
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
They have sheet metal walls pitched roofs

75
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:55,935
Delaney didn't go to snowflake to find out whether or not NCIS was Godin

76
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Real

77
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:02,591
She went to learn how people have built new lives and homes designed to fit their very particular needs

78
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
Out there on the remote

79
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
Grassy plateau

80
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,719
Susan Malloy has short curly hair and a wide grin

81
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,559
Below freezing but all the windows in her small house are open

82
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
For people with MCs

83
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,167
Their home is the only environment they can really can

84
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
Control

85
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
I'm suddenly very aware of

86
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
No

87
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
I'm worried I didn't prepare well enough

88
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
Susan offers me a cup

89
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Coffee

90
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Sure

91
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
And then

92
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
Just like I worry

93
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
I smell cigarettes

94
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,623
What would you like me to do

95
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
I'm not quite sure

96
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,487
Okay I'm going to get close to you for just a second okay sir

97
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Maybe

98
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
Okay

99
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
Reminder

100
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
Something else to wear no not at all

101
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
Glad you have gift

102
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,055
Okay Delaney is not a smoker but this is the level of Susan sensitivity

103
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
Susan is at the heart of this

104
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
Community

105
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,455
People have described her to me as a fairy godmother and the Queen

106
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
She works with curious Outsiders

107
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
Girls like me

108
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,807
She also attends conferences on

109
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Disability Rights

110
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,927
Spends hours each week answering phone calls from people who are sick

111
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
She's healthier than lots of her neighbors

112
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,279
But that hasn't always been the case

113
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,327
For me it was just

114
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
Real fast

115
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
I felt this

116
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
Just bizarre feeling in my head

117
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
My sinuses and

118
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
The palette

119
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
Of my mouth and my throat

120
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
Foreclosed

121
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
Cousins living in San Francisco when she first got sick

122
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Back in the early 90s

123
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
Your sensitivities began to

124
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Skate witches

125
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
Is pretty typical for the illness

126
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,207
Are allergy to chemicals go into a sensitivity to food

127
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Clothing

128
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Benelect

129
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
TriCity

130
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,839
Telephones computers kitchen appliances

131
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
How much everything

132
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Became toxic

133
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
Furniture had to go

134
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
The rug had to go

135
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,799
Had two girlfriends come over and and take my clothes

136
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
Susan slept on Friends porches Inn

137
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
In her car and her parents

138
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
At her sickest

139
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
She couldn't even drink chemically treated tap water

140
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,623
And her mom put buckets in the yard to gather rain

141
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,463
Then a friend with MCS invited her to visit snowflake

142
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
Rural high altitude

143
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,351
Community with good clean air he discovered it a few years before

144
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,959
Driving around the country trying to find a place where his symptoms wouldn't be so severe

145
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
And when Susan visited

146
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,567
For me the Improvement was so radical

147
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,383
You know what you get out of car you feel better

148
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,199
I can walk you don't need the oxygen tank

149
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
Here's your speech is clear

150
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,647
I didn't exactly want to move here but my body said yeah we're moving here

151
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Felt like a pass

152
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,231
Like a journey between two different worlds

153
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,839
Like in the old days for someone to get on a ship and go to the United States from

154
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Ireland

155
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,191
They didn't really want to leave it if they weren't able to make it

156
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,239
Anymore until they took

157
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
Switch respingada on a ship

158
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,591
Think it feels a little bit like that to me

159
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,503
Gradually more people move to snowflake they came from all over and engineer from Denmark

160
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,831
Marketing director from Toronto a chef from the Philippines

161
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
Teacher from San Francisco

162
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
Now

163
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,975
There are about three dozen household scattered across this area

164
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,023
All United by this illness

165
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,839
And they're not the first people in history to move

166
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Forever

167
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,703
15 people who had to relocate because

168
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
Of particular Medical

169
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
Problems or health reason

170
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,591
In fact the history of medical migration

171
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,895
This part of the country goes back a long ways

172
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
A hundred years ago doctors encouraged people with tuberculosis to Head West for the same clean dry air that

173
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
That brought Susan here

174
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
Ended up in Arizona

175
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,951
Attensity sprouted up across the state

176
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
And locals gave them a nickname

177
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Runners

178
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,095
Because of the hacking cough that characterize the illness

179
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
So this is not an uncommon

180
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
Experience for human beings

181
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,007
Right now it's our turn for it

182
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
For the new guys

183
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,383
But the complicated thing about this illness is that it's so unknown

184
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
Some doctors would argue that the

185
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
This place isolates people

186
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,759
Pushes them deeper into their sickness

187
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,671
All the talk about diets and remedies and building techniques only reinforces what might be better treated in other

188
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
What Susan told me this place saved

189
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
Your life

190
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
Kitchens the same

191
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
The bedroom

192
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Things the living room

193
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
I mean I basically live in wenzhou

194
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,495
Susan. This house herself with help from friend

195
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:53,407
The people here in Snowflake might be the closest thing there is to a NCS think-tank and they develop a building technique

196
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,967
Snakes that help manage their sensitivities

197
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,783
That means using quote-unquote safe materials

198
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,903
Like ceramic tile or concrete floors instead of carpeting which traps chemical odors

199
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,719
Susan also used foil-lined sheetrock

200
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
Which covers her walls

201
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
Give me the whole inside of her

202
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
Her house is silver sheen

203
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,631
I just couldn't afford to risk

204
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Paint

205
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,215
You know if you get the wrong kind of paint your whole house

206
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,823
Unlivable maybe forever or maybe at least for several months

207
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
A couple years

208
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
But maybe the most striking thing about the

209
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:29,503
This house is the way that Susan has isolated most of her Electronics in a separate room

210
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,319
What you can completely shut off from the rest of the

211
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
The house

212
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:38,207
That's because many people with MCS also experience sensitivity to electricity

213
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:43,583
You designed it pretty strategically with that room in mind of the room at the front of the house

214
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
Is the one where you electricity

215
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
Comes into one corner of the house

216
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
It all comes in right

217
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
Right over there

218
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,591
And the rest of the house doesn't have to be as effective

219
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,919
She keeps her television and a VCR in the

220
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
A separate room

221
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,527
And she's constructed a thick window to watch TV through

222
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
Well keeping the equipment ice

223
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
The television is

224
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
An ancient

225
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,975
One I mean by today's standards

226
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
And it's

227
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,559
Really nothing special other than it's the old

228
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
I don't want to have

229
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
New chemical emissions

230
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
In my house

231
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,495
You know from Plastics and so forth if there's any way around it

232
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,335
This one is old and aired out and

233
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
This glass

234
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
She in front of it is

235
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
To keep the fuse

236
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
In that room

237
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
Like an open the front door

238
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
And let the fumes

239
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Go out

240
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,487
Without contaminating the inside of my house

241
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,351
The house is modest but you can tell how much it means to suzhou

242
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,423
She shows me every corner and every adaptation

243
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,703
It's her Safe Haven

244
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,823
And there are lots of people who are desperate to move out here to live in a little place just like this

245
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
When Susan's phone rings it's usually not a good sign

246
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,015
I don't get calls from people for whom everything is going great

247
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
You know

248
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Hello

249
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
Hi

250
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Charles Place

251
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,535
Is I'm available cuz I am could not be doing worse

252
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
I've got to get out of here

253
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,703
Skin is literally burning and bleeding from the portion

254
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
Susan gets a few calls like this a week

255
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,543
From runners

256
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,151
People who are moving from place to place trying to find somewhere that feels safe

257
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
Snowflake isn't the only community of it

258
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,783
It's kind but it's one of the largest and most established

259
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,111
Don't that doesn't mean there's room for everyone

260
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,927
I'm sorry but there is someone living there

261
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,767
Susan Trax a limited housing in Snowflake

262
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
And she breaks the bad news when she can

263
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,911
How about you never know I'm waiting for a miracle to happen

264
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
I don't have any miracles

265
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
I wish I did

266
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:08,735
I know you're not asking me to get off but I need to go get some commotion on right now

267
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
I'm afraid that's what a typical College

268
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Looks like

269
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,719
You know people who are real sick where they are and need to be in it

270
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
Another kind of Housing and there isn't any

271
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:30,495
Over the years enough people with MCS have come to snowflake that the wider Community has adapted to them

272
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
At least a little bit

273
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,871
There's a real estate agent who helps people find MCS friendly property

274
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,175
There's an organic food store which

275
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,991
Just kind of unusual for a rural town of 5000

276
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,855
The owner there will sometimes shop for people with MCS and leave the groceries outside for them

277
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
I got so they don't have to

278
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
Coming to the store

279
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
Which smells like incense

280
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
And then there's the dentist

281
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:58,399
And my EI patients usually come in through the backdoor they wait in their cars

282
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,471
We have a separate and she's right here

283
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:07,103
VI is short for environmental illness another term for multiple chemical sensitivity

284
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,639
Melissa is a hygienist

285
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
. Sierra Dental

286
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,759
Sierra Dental regularly sees about 40 patients

287
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
With MCs

288
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
They've adapted their practice

289
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
To make it friendly to pee

290
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
People with sensitive

291
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,975
And I usually tend to see him at 8 in the morning

292
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
Because that's

293
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,095
I haven't wiped my room down with chemicals

294
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,399
Because I did it the night before

295
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:35,519
So I don't have to worry about him smelling the cavicide wipes which is what we use in 10 oz

296
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,359
Melissa also shuts down the X-ray machine opens the windows

297
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
And turns off the fluorescent light

298
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
Patience

299
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
As far as polishing teeth

300
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Are you playing

301
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Thomas

302
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Stone

303
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
The other thing we do share in the office

304
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Is

305
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
We don't use fabric soft

306
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
I actually use a natural

307
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,815
Laundry soap will use a lot of us to

308
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,911
No sprays no smelly lotions things like

309
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,775
Like I understand it a lot of them they're really

310
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
Sick because of

311
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,615
Chemicals and electronics in all sorts

312
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
The things

313
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,967
Lots of people are skeptical when they first hear about the illness

314
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
But mostly just kind of rolled with it

315
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
She did research

316
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
She believed her page

317
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Complaints

318
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:26,975
Chief and sympathized a little bit I remember as a kid I spent in a Vermont we went to the

319
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
Yankee Doodle Candle factory

320
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,863
And it was my only experience with a migraine headache

321
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,655
What's smelling all of those

322
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
The smells

323
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
And I don't have

324
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,055
Chemical sensitivities but being around all of those smells all day long was

325
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
What's the worst headache

326
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
My life

327
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,151
So I equate that with all the time with the

328
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,783
We're back on Seasons porch and she's looking out over the lands

329
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
She knows that this community.

330
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
Depends on the tolerance

331
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
Accommodation

332
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Have people like Melissa

333
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
All it takes

334
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Is

335
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,303
1 family building a gas station

336
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
Out there on the road

337
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,423
And a lot of acid have to move

338
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,567
In a little while Susan has a date with another friend in the community

339
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
She's going to read a book

340
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,663
Which means she'll stand outside his house

341
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
Hold the book up to his window

342
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
And turn the page

343
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,575
He's too sensitive to let her or even the book itself

344
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Oceanside

345
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
It makes life here in Snowflake

346
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
Seem sober

347
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Precarious

348
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
It is fragile

349
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
I know it

350
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
And

351
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
I treasure it

352
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
For being here at all

353
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
So I am hypervigilant

354
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
About

355
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,775
Always hoping that nothing's going to happen to us

356
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,591
Always having that we're going to keep getting away with

357
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
This life that we built here

358
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:08,607
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Delaney Hall from the public radio show state of the reunions

359
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,447
Did you like great stories about places in the communities that people create

360
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
And I'm guessing you do

361
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,031
So true is the show for you

Our show is produced by Sam Greenspan Katie mingle Avery trufelman and me Roman Mars
