The prisoner

88
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,488
Was an extraordinary television series made I think a 19-6

89
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,583
And it was during the sixties when you have the whole James Bond

90
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Secret agent

91
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,751
60s TV show about a British spy by Patrick mcgoohan

92
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,311
Mysteriously resigns and then

Called

98
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
The Village

99
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,087
The village is this odd little town

100
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,695
Where he doesn't know where it is he doesn't know what it is that it's just a very strange

101
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
Little place

102
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
To the Village

103
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,583
Like if it's very disorienting cuz it seems to be kind of removed

104
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,887
From all other countries in the world

105
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
They're like

106
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,775
Villas and townhouses are all smashed together

107
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,335
And it could be absolutely anywhere

108
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
And it's

109
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,407
Completely beautiful and perfect

110
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
Black

111
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
Superfly

112
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
Everything is relentlessly cheerful

113
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
And everybody

114
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
Has to get owned

115
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,951
Good good afternoon we're having a parade

116
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
So they're all kinds of mandatory parades and events and festivals and no one has names and everyone goes by a number and again and again the Spy

117
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
Now known only as number 6

118
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
I've no idea who imprisoned him in this relentless

119
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
Wesley Cherry place

120
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
Are the people are wearing puppies stripes

121
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
Shirts and suits with

122
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,871
White piping and they're wearing rainbow capes

123
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
Keds sneakers

124
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,455
But the greeting from everybody is

125
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
BC

126
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Be seeing you

127
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,807
Which on one hand sounds

128
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
See you later

129
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
But what it meant was that

130
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
See you later means

131
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
We're watching

132
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
So the whole village is under constant surveillance

133
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
All the time

134
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,495
And in every episode the members of The Village or kind of break number 6 in the

135
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,567
Tell him to elaborate my games and challenges and temptations

136
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
Try to figure out why he resigned

137
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,431
And the Spy can't leave the village or giant weather balloon

138
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
What come after having smothered

139
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
And the show only lasted like

140
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
17 episodes or so

141
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
It was really crazy

142
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
James Bond

143
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
Meats

144
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
Doctor Who

145
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
On ice

146
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,535
Yeah the show gets weirder and weirder with each for dressing up

147
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
Is that right yes

148
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
It'll actually sort of went off the rails

149
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Everybody just went crazy

150
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
Very last episode

151
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Doesn't make

152
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Any

153
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Logical Song

154
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
That's completely crazy

155
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
But

156
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
At the beginning of this

157
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Bonkers absurdist

158
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
Crazy episode

159
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
It was something that my dad

160
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
I'm truly shocked

161
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,343
At the beginning of the opening very last episode they reveal

162
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
The location of the village in real life

163
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
I just like oh my God

164
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
This place really exist

165
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
What the hell is this

166
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
The Village

167
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Looks like a set

168
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,887
But it's a real place in for my whole life

169
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
As long as I have been wearing that

170
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Weird shirt

171
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
My dad is wanted to go there

172
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
And this year

173
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
He finally did

174
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,847
You know it's in a remote Corner whale

175
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
It wasn't easy to get there

176
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,967
X-ray

177
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
After World War 1

178
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
Is it swelled architect name

179
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
Serve

180
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
Bertram

181
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
Clough williams-ellis

182
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:29,535
And he was kind of dismayed by how the UK was rebuilding after after World War one and all these gorgeous old buildings were

183
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Getting

184
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,143
Torn down or they just weren't bothering to rebuild in the Beautiful

185
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,679
Classical style they were building

186
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
Burlesque

187
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Concrete block

188
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
Ring and

189
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
So when he acquired this

190
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Remote

191
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,127
Plot of land in 1825

192
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
In

193
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
Home country of Wales

194
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
He decided to bring

195
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,527
The beauty of the whole of Europe

196
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,831
Back to his homeland literally

197
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:58,207
And as a zealous would travel around the world he'd find a Colonnade or building or church

198
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,767
Or maybe the top two floors of a church

199
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
Dismantle it ship it to

200
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
To Port my running rebuild

201
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,935
British person

202
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
Portmeirion

203
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,823
And from 1925 to 1975

204
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,639
Call William Ellis Williams Ellis

205
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
Hunted for all these crumbling remains of

206
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
Castles and houses in Villas

207
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
Across the continent especially the Mediterranean

208
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
And rescued

209
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,855
Vibranium to this one spot

210
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
And the kind of fund it

211
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,183
Became a resort

212
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,023
I've never seen anything like it cuz usually you think of Hotel it's a building

213
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
But this is 35 building

214
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
In an isolated area

215
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
At each building

216
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
I mean besides the other restaurants

217
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,519
Supports like a miniature Disneyland

218
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,591
Except unlike Disneyland everythingfx

219
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,919
Play real like it's all actually old architecture

220
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
But apparently

221
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,247
I mean here I have his books

222
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:58,367
But you can even look at pictures of it these are my dad's my dad's literature

223
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,487
But it still looks quite Disney ask because it's all painted these bright colors

224
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
Yeah

225
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
It really does that mean it's like

226
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
I would have never thought it was real

227
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
From what I've seen of it

228
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,263
Yeah it's crazy it's almost like why would you go to the effort of doing it for real

229
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
It looks so fake

230
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,639
But it does remind me that when we look at

231
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
Old architecture

232
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
We

233
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,295
Expect to see the weathering of it and if you really do restore it

234
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
It is bright and shiny and odd and

235
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
Brightly colored in pink and

236
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
Bright yellows and things like that

237
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
Public clock Williams Ellis County

238
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,047
The step further cuz he added

239
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
You like adding stuff

240
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,911
You put in fake windows that weren't really very like

241
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Pokemon

242
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,031
And he added stairways that didn't go anywhere just cuz he thought they looks

243
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Teaneck

244
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
Aldi's wine teapot

245
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,407
He also kind of like

246
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
Turned it into this Tutti Frutti

247
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
Playground of

248
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
Actual

249
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,599
And the cool thing was

250
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
It was post-modernism before post-modernism looks like a lot of styles that we would recognize

251
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Smashing

252
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,655
You know Colonnades on villazon Gothic clock towers

253
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
I'm painting it all bright colors

254
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,263
And so in a weird way I can mess up

255
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
Extra crazy in the 60

256
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
No one was

257
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Doing that

258
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Although

259
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,783
You may be without having gone through post-modernism you would just see it as this

260
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
A weird collage

261
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
Whereas we might

262
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Now how the

263
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Language of

264
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
Disney and cheesy post-modernism to apply to this thing like maybe it looks cheap to us because of our

265
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
Our lived experience of these things

266
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
But it might have

267
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,751
Just felt opulent amazing to somebody before postmodernism exist

268
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
How do you say that

269
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:56,127
Architecture critic Lewis Mumford wrote in 1964

270
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:02,527
Portmeirion is a gay deliberately irresponsible reaction against the Dulce realities of so much that passes

271
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Modern Art

272
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,855
Hair today

273
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,207
Shocking no one has seen anything like it and Frank Lloyd Wright went to visit it

274
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
Gregory Peck came to visit

275
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
Ingrid Bergman came to visit

276
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
Brian Epstein from the Beatles

277
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
I would stay there George Harrison

278
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
You stayed there a lot of

279
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,727
British celebrities

280
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
Shuffle Joe there

281
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:27,871
Because it was so isolated that it was so beautiful and they

282
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
Treated everybody with a sense of

283
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967
Discretion it was a place that we

284
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
What kind of separate from the rest

285
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
Save the world

286
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
And removed

287
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
Contacts

288
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
For your name.

289
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:42,719
Matter basically all the stuff that made it for number 6

290
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,815
I was there for the prisoner Appreciation Society weekends

291
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,911
People walking writeaprisoner costumes they were re-enacting I remember episodes

292
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,727
My dad was there for this thing called pork

293
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
Maricon

294
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,103
What does basically like a giant cosplay event for the prisoner

295
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,455
Where everyone they do parades and they pretend to abduct people and they the giant balloon

296
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
Putting around

297
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,527
Everyone's wearing striped capes

298
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
Mcad

299
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
Except my dad

300
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
You know it was a little

301
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
Little Matt's is a little to buy a

302
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,463
I enjoyed the spectacle I wasn't up for the life

303
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
What kind of coconut is my dad's

304
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
Favorite show

305
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
Who loves this show

306
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,375
And so for him it was kind of visiting

307
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
An old friend

308
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
Cuz like they tried to remix

309
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
The prisoner

310
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Kind of recently

311
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
They tried to do

312
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
American version of it

313
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
It was Tara

314
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Who's terrible

315
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
I don't know what else to say it was

316
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Parable because

317
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,479
My dad says it just can't work without the main star and visionary

318
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
Check my device is the one who made it weird

319
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
But it also couldn't work

320
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
Without Portmeirion

321
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
I think if the prisoner were done in like a Star Trek thing

322
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,279
It it wouldn't work but made it so incongruous that you weren't

323
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
Natural environment of these beautiful old building

324
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,167
That's what I think made it even more horrifying because it was so pleasant

325
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
It was so cute and it was so Charmed

326
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
At Owasso analog

327
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
And so that's the cool thing about

328
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,407
The Prisoner and Portmeirion itself it's not trying to be too

329
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Attributed

330
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
The past

331
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
Or a vision of the future

332
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
It's just

333
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
Kind of dislike

334
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
Amalgamated alter

335
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,159
Ternative reality but in a weird way in both cases

336
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Portmeirion

337
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
And the Prisoner

338
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
They just

339
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,047
Turn into alternate realities that look like what we have

340
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,863
Today Casino

341
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:29,727
Postmodernism and Disneyland and also this like World of constant surveillance and

342
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
Constance Uranus

343
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
It shows that the

344
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,359
The sort of fantastic nightmare that

345
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
Mcgoohan was

346
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Predicting

347
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,223
In some cases are certainly not technologically pasa

348
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,271
That's totally why I still

349
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
Where the shark

350
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,927
It is very soft that's awesome thank you April

351
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:56,095
Ksenia

352
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,495
Next

353
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
This is producer Vivien Leigh

354
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,919
So I'm just remembering right now that the first time you appeared on this show

355
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,319
Was last year's many stories before you were a staff member at 9 p.m.

356
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:22,207
Oh nice Ron so great so happy you're here and so what is your mini story as a

357
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
A staff member

358
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,047
So I'm going to start this with another question

359
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
So

360
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,631
You travel a lot right

361
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
And

362
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
You trouble with device

363
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Okay

364
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
So have you ever been on the road

365
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,823
And one of your batteries

366
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:43,711
Runs out of power on the phone it's like 5 or 6 p.m. consistently that's the way it is

367
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,831
Right yeah oh yeah it's it's the rule as around the battery but how useful would it be

368
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,135
If I told you that there was an AC free

369
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
Battery powered battery charger

370
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
That would let you fully charged

371
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
That one battery

372
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,023
And all it needs

373
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,583
Are 12 batteries of the same type

374
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,143
Charge that one dead battery

375
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:06,495
That doesn't sound very useful that sounds a little

376
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
It's not useful

377
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
But at the same time

378
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
It's not entirely

379
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
Unused

380
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,199
That's true that's true it's not

381
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
Entire leg still use that thing

382
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,391
That monstrosity that you are describing a battery powered battery charger is something that

383
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Actually exist

384
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
Wow and it's one example of something called

385
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Chindogu

386
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,559
Which is the art of Designing nearly useless gadgets

387
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,887
Wow okay so what do you mean exactly by nearly useless

388
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,471
So I change okay with a very specific type of invention that

389
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
Sets out to solve

390
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
One particular problem

391
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:45,407
But it actually ends up causing so much more of an inconvenience that it's almost entirely useless

392
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,991
So in the case of the battery powered battery charger you'd

393
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:55,391
Technically solve your problem with having one dead battery but you make a much larger Problem by draining 12

394
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,207
Other batteries

395
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:03,071
So it comes from the Japanese word chin meaning weird or strange and dogu meaning tools

396
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
So strange 2

397
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
Another example

398
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
They're literally

399
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,263
Thousands of them

400
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,663
A pair of high heels with training wheels attached the heels so if you're just learning how to walk in high heels you have a little

401
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,271
Okay right there there's is done kitty litter box

402
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,671
So you can practice the art of sand raking while you're cleaning up cat, but do you want to know what my favorite

403
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,743
Absolutely need to know

404
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
Solar powered flashlight

405
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:43,007
Technically could use it but you wouldn't really actually use it

406
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:48,127
So where do these ideas come from does anyone actually make them or they just ideas

407
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:54,271
So you can probably tell by the name but it started in Japan with a man named Kenji kawakami

408
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
Meet Kenji kawakami

409
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,879
Japan famous inventor of the useful

410
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
Anixter

411
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,975
His Creations range from Umbrellas for shoes

412
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
Two hairs flashcards

413
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
Two chopsticks

414
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
With fans

415
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,655
Soquel, you'd study to Aeronautical Engineering in college

416
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:14,239
And he's always been interested in engineering and design and

417
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,591
He came up with the concept and started making his own creation sometime in the 1980s

418
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,407
But somehow we actually ended up in publishing

419
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
Which is kind of how

420
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
Chindogu took off

421
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,063
So what kind of posting was he doing was he's busy polishing these

422
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
Like these items so in the early 90s he was the editor of a Japanese catalog called mail-order life

423
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,351
Which is you know what one of those home shopping magazines and so there's this one month when he realized

424
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:46,751
There was some spare blank pages in the back so instead of just leaving the blank he decided to include some images of these

425
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:53,151
Unuseless inventions that he been tinkering around in his workshop with so you know they were for sale anything--but

426
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,551
So he had a solar-powered flashlight which I mentioned earlier and

427
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,367
Also a pair of I drop classes which are

428
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,695
Essentially a pair of glasses with funnels over the lenses

429
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,231
So you can just

430
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
Put eye drops in a funnel directly into your eyeballs like little holes Donuts

431
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,447
The other three years ended up getting such a kick out of them

432
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
But you know she started putting chindogu and every issue after that it's after a few years of doing this this American Dream

433
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,919
Listen translator named and Poppy I came across it

434
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,479
And he was like I have to

435
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:34,879
Spread this to the rest of the world and so the two of them together founded the international chindogu Society

436
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
Established the 10:10

437
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
Chindogu

438
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,863
Stewby's have rule so it was a what are some of the tenants to make it a truly a true chindogu

439
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,727
Okay so the first rule is that itching dogu has to be almost completely useless

440
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,311
So if you created something that's actually useful

441
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,103
You failed your done

442
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:01,759
The second rule is that it has to actually exist so you have to actually build a Jindo go

443
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Wondering that's okay

444
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
You can't just make this

445
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,111
Hypothetical even kneel like that

446
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:12,767
A picture of the mail order catalog actually have to make the cat

447
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
Cool and

448
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,631
So the third was actually my favorite it says

449
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,959
Inherent in every chindogu is the spirit of Anarchy

450
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,751
And then it goes on to say

451
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:29,151
They represent freedom of thought and action the freedom to challenge the suffocating historical dominance of conservative

452
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:35,551
Utility I think I'm getting sold like a little bit of this is it

453
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,367
Is an exercise in Rebellion

454
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
Or

455
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,927
The Uber design

456
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
Product that is perfect

457
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
Text that had that does its job was great efficiency in his like

458
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
If I freeze you

459
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,399
Weirdo inventions that don't

460
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,543
Function but don't actually function well

461
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,359
Utility and Design

462
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,663
But that is totally true

463
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
Yeah and I mean it seems a little strange

464
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:10,367
To use absurdist design as a form of Anarchy but before kawakami got into publishing

465
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
Was actually a radical

466
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,231
60s and 70s and so the spirit of

467
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:21,631
Nonconformity and anti-consumerism there's something that's rooted in the concept of chindogu

468
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
A couple of other tenants that dictate

469
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,823
You can't sell the invention for money and you also can't patent it because it belongs to everybody

470
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,895
Supposed to be like the embodiment of design without the restrictive

471
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:37,247
Read materialism you can tell by the way that he talks about it like

472
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:43,135
I still use it kind of Purity he intended them to be fight like a fun way to change the world

473
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,303
I believe that if everybody shares my idea of changing perception for says

474
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,095
The world could change

475
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
One invention

476
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
At a time

477
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,031
Is it what happened to chindogu as a movement

478
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,335
Aldi's big lofty ideas

479
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:08,735
Right right you know just spread internationally their chindogu societies and competitions all over the world but kawakami actually ended

480
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,295
Putting a bunch of books out with

481
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:16,672
I'm useless inventions that he's made over the years or that people have submitted into the chindogu society

482
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
But since one of the tenants

483
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,328
I thought you can't make money from chindogu he actually ended up doing eating a lot of the money to charity

484
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,168
Awesome ice

485
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,960
But I actually have one of us book

486
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,752
Hear that was

487
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,848
Published originally in 1995 and can you

488
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Tell me what you see

489
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
It is a camera

490
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
On a long stick

491
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
With a plunger

492
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
2

493
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,744
Porsche the shutter of the camera this is a selfie stick

494
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,024
Portrait camera

495
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Do it yourself without a

496
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,680
I know that it is a couple

497
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
Target pictures with you in them

498
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:08,128
It can be embarrassing to ask someone to take a photo for you confusing if they don't speak your language even costly if the

499
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,176
Third-party regard your camera as a gift

500
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,344
With a 57cm telescoping pole your dilemma is overspending to three times its length

501
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,416
Companion in your environment

502
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
Your only problem will be that

503
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,536
All your shots will capture you in the act of holding a pole

504
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:31,936
Zoom feature of your photo album unless you really like poles

505
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:37,824
Image of flan selfie stick years before the

506
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
The patent for the selfie stick

507
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:44,736
It came out so I don't know if kawakami failed at making

508
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
H&L go

509
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,624
Or if we fail the societies because people are still using

510
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
Healthy snacks

511
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,976
I think we felt this is society

512
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,280
Thank you Vivian that's great thank you

513
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,464
So I'm in the studio with him at the church

514
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
How are you doing

515
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,304
Good are you

516
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
So what is your name

517
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,472
All right so many stories out Blue Glass

518
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,800
And specifically it's about this

519
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:45,920
Screen. In the mid-to-late 19th century

520
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
Blue glass with a light

521
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,016
Passing through a blue pane of glass

522
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
Could solve

523
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,832
Just about any problems deposit

524
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
We have

525
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
And this all goes back

526
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,672
To a civil war

527
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:01,280
General General Augustus J Pleasanton was a

528
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,584
Soldier in the Civil War

529
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,888
And he was a gentleman scientist

530
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
She did a lot of reading

531
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:11,520
So this is Jenny Benjamin and she's the curator of the Museum of

532
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:17,920
Asian in San Francisco

533
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,992
General Pleasanton and she says that you know

534
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,040
This armchair scientist

535
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,648
It really shooting from the hip and he had all kinds of wacky signs

536
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:34,048
You know that the blue color of the sky

537
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,400
There must be some inherent value to that color and that blue light

538
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
Why was part of like what

539
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
Facilitated the growth

540
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,520
The plants and animals in and biological

541
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Prophecies

542
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,336
So he built Pleasant

543
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,640
And that is felt a garden nursery

544
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
In his backyard

545
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,480
With alternating blue Plains

546
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
Glass

547
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
And

548
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,064
He ran a quote experiment

549
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
I see how well they vegetables

550
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
This is like a greenhouse

551
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,976
Yes like a drink but I didn't want to use the term Greenhouse

552
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
Because

553
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
It was a blue house

554
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,728
NBC says quote experiment

555
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,776
Gentleman scientist

556
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,848
But basically he was growing grapes

557
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
Inside of this

558
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
Glass

559
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,968
House with a certain amount of the windows

560
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,992
Painted blue

561
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
You can kind of

562
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
Imagine what happens next

563
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
The story right now I think so

564
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
Pleasanton reports

565
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Of course

566
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
That is plants

567
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,512
Through to incredible size

568
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072
So then he expanded the

569
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,888
Created an Animal Planet

570
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
It was for pigs

571
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,544
And he claimed the pigs grow to enormous size and it was all because of the blue

572
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
A blue light

573
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
So great

574
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
Tok

575
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,624
What kind of rounds around the country extolling the virtues of

576
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,024
A blue light even got a patent applied for a patent for what

577
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
Cerulean process

578
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,120
But I love that

579
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
Is it really amazing

580
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:18,240
According to him he says

581
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,568
The patent officer came to his farm

582
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,872
And this is what he supposedly said

583
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,784
If my investigation should establish the Verity of your statements you have made the most important discovery of the sea

584
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,832
Transcending and importance

585
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,136
Even that of morse's telegraph

586
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
Wechat

587
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,976
Best furnished only means of communication with this

588
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,024
In places while your discovery

589
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,584
Could be brought home to every living object in the

590
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
Planet

591
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,936
Your patent would be one of the most valuable ever issued in the United States

592
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
Wow

593
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:54,080
By tentative price

594
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,896
And anytime any all about this

595
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,688
About me on how blue light but

596
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
Panacea

597
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,528
And it was touted as a cure-all

598
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Write everything

599
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
Skin conditions

600
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
Your eyesight

601
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Also

602
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Baldness

603
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
Insomnia back pain

604
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
Serious

605
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Ebates away with saying you know

606
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
This can do

607
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
Everything in the book

608
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,096
Was really popular

609
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:22,496
And had all these testimonials ended up people saying all this giant just like Jeremiah paraplegic

610
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,288
Child are or whatever

611
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:29,664
And so every two years at 1876 and 1877

612
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,688
It was suddenly this

613
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
Huge bad for all

614
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:38,880
They're blue eyeglasses you show me a pair of blue eyeglasses from this. At the Museum of vision

615
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,464
Blue wallpaper but the big thing was blue windows

616
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,560
Some people would build like a little sun porches

617
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,912
1 blue glass window Neil thinking that

618
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
You know if you

619
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
Could spend time

620
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:58,336
Bathing in the blue lights that that would cheer whatever railed you

621
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,152
And this has become known as the blue glass

622
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,688
Craze

623
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,992
And so when did the Blue Glass

624
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
Craze

625
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:12,160
Come crashing down when people realize it didn't work at all. Quickly

626
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:17,280
What is a couple years was going on there were people that were kind of

627
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,584
Poking fun the same way

628
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,984
People believe in pseudo-scientific things that were editorials written about the video

629
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:31,872
Installing Blue Glass all through their houses but the reels are nail in the coffin

630
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,152
What's this

631
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,968
Yeah Scientific American

632
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:42,368
It speaks to how widespread it was a Scientific American took it upon themselves to like thoroughly debunked

633
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
Did debunking every ass

634
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
Aspect of

635
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
This

636
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,888
And you know just to be perfectly clear about

637
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,960
There is there is no way that color

638
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
By itself

639
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,032
Or colored light is

640
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Going to

641
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
Share your ID

642
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
Or any

643
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
Garcia.

644
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,736
So are there any of these blue Windows left like out in the world

645
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
Yeah I asked Jenny.

646
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Are there like

647
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,576
Remnants of

648
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Era that you

649
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Be today like

650
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,696
Windows in buildings anywhere or

651
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,536
That is a really good question I don't know if there any building

652
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
Blue windows

653
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
Specifically because of this

654
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,656
But I bet it somewhere I would

655
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Surprised

656
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,752
Chase them down probably

657
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,312
If we were to find this

658
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
It would probably

659
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Just one

660
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Blue

661
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
Window

662
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,832
Oh please tell me you found it well okay so one of the most comprehensive writing about this are

663
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,904
Era was by on the writer Paul Collins so he's so Gray

664
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,400
And she chapter about Augustus Pleasanton in one of his books and and

665
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
Chapter he talks about

666
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,216
About himself

667
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
Finding a window

668
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
A blue glass window when he was

669
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,616
Living in San Francisco until I called him up to

670
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
Deserve talked about that

671
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:13,760
1

672
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
With syrup

673
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,344
Thriller type of area

674
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,392
Glass paint

675
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,976
100% sure that this is from that era

676
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
Troy I know that might have.

677
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,096
70

678
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,424
Put the age of the house with such that it is

679
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,984
It was like the right era

680
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,800
For that to have been an original

681
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,872
In the book he talks about how it's been

682
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
Queen

683
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:47,040
These two gas stations on this one Street into the sunset in San Francisco

684
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,600
Google Street View

685
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,672
And so here check it out

686
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,488
So here is

687
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
The house

688
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,328
You can see

689
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
Yeah these two panes here

690
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
How do you say

691
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,984
He thinks that this little entryway on the house

692
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,776
Is this one of these

693
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
There's some porches

694
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
That's awesome

695
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,616
Yeah it's pretty until you know it's like

696
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:17,248
Older looking house on the Block

697
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,064
Looks like it could be from that era right

698
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,880
I'm for sure and so yeah I

699
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
Decided to

700
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
Go check it out

701
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
Can the Shell station the Chevron

702
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
What we can find

703
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,728
No

704
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,520
Oh no

705
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,128
It's gone the house is

706
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
God

707
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
So

708
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:55,136
It was it was gone the house had been turned into like a condo

709
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:02,560
So even that picture from Google Street View is out of date and the crazy thing is at that was from 2017

710
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:12,032
You feel any better

711
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:17,408
How healthy are you and I get there and blue windows

712
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
Torn down and now there's a

713
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
Giant

714
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,760
Box

715
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
The huge Clear Window

716
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
It's really ugly

717
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
Trying to reinstall Jack

718
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,488
About architecture

719
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,280
And buildings but

720
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
This one really looks

721
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Terrible

722
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,144
And worst of all

723
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
Glasses

724
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
Clear

725
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
Clear glass

726
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
Yasso

727
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,080
The story

728
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,408
After a long search I still have not found a blue glass window

729
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:54,016
You know if anyone out there

730
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:58,624
Expand from that area that I mean

731
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
Plausible that

732
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,208
Someone out there has got one of these windows to get take a look at

733
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
Tell me awesome

734
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
Cool thank you so much thank you

735
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:16,288
AB next one more Christmas-themed many story you're going to want this for your Christmas party banter right after

736
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
Between the beats

737
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,928
Bongs and chatter of our devices

738
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,512
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

739
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
If

740
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:43,936
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

741
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Technology

742
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
He talked to us

743
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,872
It is a creation of Sonic trash

744
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,944
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

745
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,528
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

746
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,320
To make them more human

747
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,416
Turn the living room lights on

748
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Okay

749
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
Dim the living room lights

750
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
50%

751
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,816
Okay

752
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:16,960
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

753
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,264
Makes for a much more natural

754
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
Experience

755
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,824
Turn the living room lights on

756
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
Dim the living room lights

757
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,176
50%

758
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,600
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,416
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

760
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,976
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

761
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,792
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

762
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560

763
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,936
Our final many story of the day

764
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
Comes from senior producer

765
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
Katie Mingle

766
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,800
Really cozy in Herriman

767
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:58,176
It's not cozy enough to start a 3.5 box

768
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:04,576
So hot in here but just roll with me

769
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,880
Starting a fire in here right now though

770
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,208
We could go to

771
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
YouTube

772
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,024
And find ourselves a yule log

773
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,584
Jamaica YouTube right now

774
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:21,216
Just a tiny bit of History a yule log

775
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
Is an old term

776
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,568
For a certain type of fire that

777
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,592
People with burn

778
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
A Christmas would like us

779
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:34,272
Special log but now often when people talk about yule yule log the talking about

780
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
Like

781
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,576
Like this

782
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
Put on that

783
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,696
Oh this temper slendrina hours of crackling logs for Christmas okay

784
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,560
It's it doesn't start as soon as the fire starts crackling

785
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,096
Like it's relaxing

786
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,448
This idea of putting a fireplace on TV

787
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,496
So that you can watch it as if

788
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,824
You know you had a fire in your home

789
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,128
Actually goes back to nineteen

790
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944
Cool and it started at this

791
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:08,320
Little television local television station in New York City called WPIX

792
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,112
And

793
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,672
And it was kind of the brainchild of

794
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,720
The station manager guy name

795
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
Fred thrower

796
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,840
And heat you know how people are always like looking for

797
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
For Holiday content

798
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:26,496
Migrate like we know this from working and radio

799
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544
You wanted to give

800
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Dwellers

801
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
The luxury and the worm

802
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,920
FAU walk fire

803
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
Didn't have fireplaces

804
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,576
So that's Chip arcuri he's kind of an amateur

805
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,856
Historian of this

806
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,904
Original yule log

807
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,952
The location for the first shoot

808
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,232
Are you organized

809
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
Gracie Mansion

810
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
Which was the mayor's residence

811
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,632
At the time the mayor was John Lindsay

812
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,936
And he gave them permission

813
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,728
To come and film

814
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
And

815
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,616
They did but there was a mishap where

816
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Blue out

817
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,968
And it damage the very expensive oriental rug

818
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:16,160
So yeah this was this was like a $4,000 rug apparently and they really messed it up

819
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:22,560
Anyway they got their footage they put it on the air it was a 3 hour long broadcast with

820
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:28,960
Louis a loop of this fire and it would air on Christmas Eve and you turn on your TV to Channel 11

821
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,288
It started actually started with like

822
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,056
This little

823
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,104
Christmas time you know

824
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
Special message from

825
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
Someone at the station

826
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
It's the one that I found online it's it's

827
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,528
It's just striking because it's

828
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
How to put this in

829
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
Very

830
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,488
Jesus forward

831
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
Let's hear it

832
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,328
More than any other person in history

833
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,656
Jesus taught us to respect the godliness in ourselves

834
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
And give it expression

835
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,752
By doing God's work in the world

836
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,848
The gifts which we give this Christmas season

837
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,408
As symbols of God's great gift to us

838
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,456
Will pass and be forgotten

839
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,064
Wow

840
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,416
This is a secular UHF

841
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,208
Local

842
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,256
New Station

843
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,816
Sew-in then after that message

844
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,120
They cut to the fireplace switch

845
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,424
What's the governor's mansion fireplace

846
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,776
And the camera would kind of do like a slow Zoom

847
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,824
Start out seeing like

848
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
Whole mantle

849
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,664
And there was stockings on the mantle

850
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:46,016
It would slowly Zoom in to where you were just

851
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,808
Seen the fire

852
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
And then

853
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,392
For the next 3 hours they would play

854
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
Christmas music

855
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:57,024
It is classic Christmas music from the 1950s and 60s

856
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:03,168
So yeah so it's like a lot of orchestral kind of big band stuff like people like

857
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
The ray conniff singers

858
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,264
Fred Waring and the

859
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,312
Pennsylvanian Percy Faith

860
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
Percy faces the king of the yule log

861
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,664
There's nobody that has more songs in the program

862
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,552
Virginia log of Tombstone

863
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,880
I've always said that the program

864
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,440
If the program aired with a

865
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
Great video of a fireplace

866
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,048
Interior soundtrack

867
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,376
Not done very well

868
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,448
But it's paired with a great soundtrack

869
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Chip loves

870
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,496
Christmas music

871
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:42,336
He at some point he mentioned his list of top 500

872
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:48,736
The songs that I liked was like I didn't even know there were 500 Christmas song

873
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,296
That's great

874
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:59,232
So you're basically grew up with this Yule Log broadcast it was a Christmas Eve

875
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Tradition

876
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,400
Yeah he and his family used to watch it together even though they they actually had a real fireplace

877
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,216
He did actually watch it beside me watch

878
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
The actual

879
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,544
Program the actual footage

880
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,640
Yeah like you would kind of gather around and put it on a new doll like

881
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,016
Yeah oh yeah

882
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,552
It would be on one side of the room

883
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,856
The TV with the fireplace with

884
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
The other side

885
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
Real fireplace

886
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,768
And we're probably watching you log more than we were the real car place

887
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,608
Some New Yorkers love

888
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,912
This broadcast and eventually

889
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,960
The station decides they need to

890
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,544
Therese shoot it because the film that they shot it on his

891
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,104
Is deteriorating

892
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
Who's actually a 17c

893
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:54,272
Second Loop people Pepsi like

894
00:40:54,528 --> 00:41:00,672
That's crazy so but you remember how like the first time they shot it they

895
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:07,328
Play like Brenda a hole in the governor's drug will he did not forget

896
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,864
Yeah

897
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:13,472
He would not let the back at Gracie Mansion because of the mishap at the rug

898
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
They need it

899
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,336
Location he wouldn't let them go back there

900
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:22,176
And somehow in this part is kind of lost to history someone

901
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,504
Found a very similar looking fireplace

902
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
And you'll never guess

903
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
Where was

904
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,856
They located at

905
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
Very close

906
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,160
Silver fireplace

907
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,952
California ball places

908
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
Palo Alto

909
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,536
And they refilled it in August of 90

910
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,096
During a heatwave

911
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,656
In Northern California

912
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
Bay area zone

913
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:49,568

914
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848

Yule log

919
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,415
Not to be confused with

920
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,951
The original

921
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
Yule log

922
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:11,583
The 1966 you logout was shot at Gracie Mansion that are for those first four years

923
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
Is the original

924
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,143
But it's not the class

925
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
Because most people

926
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
Don't remember

927
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
Original

928
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,775
Wow

929
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,079
So yeah this one this one aired for a really long time

930
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
But then in 1990 Christmas Comes

931
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
And chips

932
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,991
Turns on his TV just like you did

933
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,015
Every year

934
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,063
I mean turns Channel 11

935
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
And

936
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,415
It just wasn't on we're all looking for it wasn't on

937
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,719
Luckily for me I just

938
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
Had a feeling.

939
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,303
Love you forever and I recorded it

940
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:49,215
Add a recording so he was fine but the rest of New York was just out of luck

941
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,775
And people were mad the station got a ton of letters

942
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,335
Why did they take out there after 20 years

943
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:58,175
So the station got actually got a new program director

944
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
The new program director came in and

945
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,039
It's taking up too much

946
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,575
Marshall time you'll take it off

947
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,391
Scrooge heartless

948
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:13,791
So it's a chip and a few other people actually started a petition to get it back on the air they set up a Wii

949
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,583
Website called bring back the log

950
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
Dot-com

951
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:23,519
But yeah but nothing seemed to persuade the station that it was worth bringing back until actually 9

952
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
11

953
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,311
What happened is that

954
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,335
Terrorist attacks

955
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,127
Betty Oliver leveno

956
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,919
Was the president of the station at the time

957
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
Top New Yorkers needed comfort

958
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
Television

959
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,247
They needed something

960
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
Remind him of

961
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,343
Happier days

962
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:43,999
Oh yeah they put it back on and it still runs today runs

963
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,583
I believe it's an hour on Christmas Eve and then

964
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,399
You hours on Christmas Day

965
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:55,775
Chip believes very strongly that the best time to watch it is Christmas Eve and

966
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,591
The way he talks about it it's like

967
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
It's scared

968
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,895
Play spiritual for him it's like

969
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,175
Christmas Eve Mass

970
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,759
All the cards are sent to

971
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,551
Cookies are baked to get Saran Wrap

972
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,879
Relax and enjoy the solemnity of the bone

973
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
Tranquility of Christmas

974
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,743
For the crazy Christmas Russian Chris

975
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511

00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Nice

977
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:24,703
Is it the same Palo Alto fire did they film something new I believe they're still using that

978
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
That same Palo Alto

979
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,311
Yes that's chipper Curry he runs

980
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,127

Biolife.com

982
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,991
He's basically the keeper of all things yule log

983
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:41,087
I'm Heaven helps the TV station add another hour of

984
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:41,855
Music

985
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:45,183

00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,887
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

1017
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,727
A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

1018
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,823
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a

1019
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,615
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

1020
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,151
We're looking the part

1021
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,943
Might cost you your life

1022
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,063
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

1023
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,415
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

1024
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:56,767
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

1025
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,423
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff actually if I'm being honest

1026
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,751
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing

1027
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:13,151
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

1028
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,479
Was found dead in my private gym

1029
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,807
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

1030
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:24,159
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

1031
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,183
Now

1032
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,487
I need to clear my name

1033
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:32,863
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

1034
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,631
To find them

1035
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:41,823
