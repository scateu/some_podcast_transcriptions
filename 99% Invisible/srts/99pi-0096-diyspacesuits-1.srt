Connecting with that audience when your message will resonate the most

11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,792
LinkedIn can help

These guys are about to test

00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Spacey

37
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,752
But this is not a recording of an a******

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,848
This is Cameron Smith's ground-floor studio apartment in Portland Oregon

39
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,176
Let's do Lisa Pate also from Portland Oregon

40
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:58,528
To the creator of the public radio program and podcast called destination DIY

41
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
Do we have to say what DIY stands for

42
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
Sure it seems for do-it-yourself

43
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
You might think build your own space suit at home is a little extreme on the DIY Spectrum if you do I totally agree with you

44
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,840
Is pretty crazy we've talked about a lot of

45
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:16,704
Kind of do-it-yourself projects on destination DIY we have a very broad definition of

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
Do-it-yourself Way Beyond the cross and Home Improvement projects

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,432
That might first spring to mind when you hear the words do it yourself

48
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:31,808
And this is definitely up there with perhaps the most daunting of DIY projects that you could imagine

49
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:38,720
Sure there are commercial companies like Virgin Galactic and explore creating their own space gear and they are DIY

50
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
In the sense that they aren't NASA

51
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,304
But Cameron Smith is

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,096
Handcrafting his space suit

53
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
Under the suit I wear a

54
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,728
Pair of long johns

55
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,312
I showed some socks on to them so they don't slip up on my legs when I pee

56
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,080
I push my legs in

57
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,456
And I sewed I think I'm about 25 feet now of plastic

58
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
6 hose

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,296
It's sewn into the suit and ice water circulates

60
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
Do there and it keeps

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
McCool

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,208
And that's absolutely critical it gets so hot in the suit that you would pass out

63
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
I what's the temperature in their eyes

64
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
117 degrees

65
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
But it's

66
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
It's really crude you

67
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
See it

68
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
I don't have a sewing machine

69
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
So I just sit on my bed and I watch

70
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,872
The movie or something and just do it by hand

71
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,200
He's not kidding the sewing looks like something out of Frankenstein

72
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
The second layer of the suit

73
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
It's called the pressure bladder

74
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,112
It's basically forming a bubble around Cameron's body to hold the air in

75
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,696
The third layer goes over that and that's the

76
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
Pressure restraint clarinets made of

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Panels

78
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,048
Of non-elastic

79
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Mesh

80
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,656
It looks like a like a cargo bags

81
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
So those are so.

82
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Hoover the pressure bladder

83
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Because

84
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,800
If you were to blow up just the pressure

85
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Ship ladder

86
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Contains the gas

87
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,944
It blows up into sort of like the Michelin Man

88
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
It in you you could

89
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
Survive

90
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
But you couldn't do anything

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
You can't bend your arm

92
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,880
You would be in kind of a spread eagle position

93
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Floating deck

94
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
You couldn't do it

95
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,488
Total cost of Cameron Smith spacesuit

96
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
2000 bucks

97
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,583
Around 100 of 1% of the cost

98
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Of the latest

99
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
NASA space suit

100
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,167
Does technology over the last

101
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
48 years has

102
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,007
Become much cheaper and much more available and better

103
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:31,871
You can essentially build a do-it-yourself space program today and now luckily I'm

104
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
Cameron is not an astronaut

105
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,223
He's not even an engineer

106
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
He's actually an archaeologist

107
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,599
He's on faculty in the anthropology department at Portland State

108
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,415
But Cameron is an Explorer by Nature

109
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
He's been diving in Puget Sound

110
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,791
Survived Arctic Winters in Iceland and Alaska

111
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,863
And some of that Oregon's Mount Hood more times than he can count

112
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
The spacesuit is his latest and most

113
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Ambitious

114
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
Showing their tits

115
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Possible

116
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
To do it cheaply

117
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,615
Is I guess my part of this larger

118
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
Movement of

119
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,967
Opening space up too many rather than few

120
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,783
The spacesuit has been three years in the making

121
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,855
You only have to look around Cameron's tiny apartment

122
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
To see how committed he is

123
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
This project

124
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
Instead of hanging art on the wall

125
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
Cameron has each of the suits

126
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,535
Three layers hanging side-by-side neck

127
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
Odoo is bad

128
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
Which is surrounded by bookshelves

129
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,655
Crammed full of NASA patents and other research material

130
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:32,287
His living room serves as the staging area for the gas canisters and the gondola where he test

131
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
The suit

132
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
Eventually he wants to connect that gondola

133
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,479
And all of the life-support gear to a balloon that will take him 50,000 feet in the air

134
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,039
He is also showing the balloon himself

135
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,367
At 50000 feet above the surface of the Earth

136
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
Cameron will experience

137
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
Space like condition

138
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,279
And that means he'll need his suit to protect him from extreme temperatures

139
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
And decompression sickness

140
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
And that's what you get from

141
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,447
Going from sea level to high altitude less pressure

142
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
And you decompress your body starts

143
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,639
The swell up nitrogen bubbles in your tissues start to come out of solution and they give you the bends

144
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
Divers kit

145
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
Decompression sickness

146
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
A suit with even 3 pounds of pressure per square inch

147
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,319
And keep a person healthy at high altitude conditions

148
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,391
And that's just about what Cameron suit holds on a good day

149
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,695
He's worked hard to try to close off all the lights

150
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
But it's an ongoing process

151
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
And Cameron knows what you think of this

152
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
I really didn't want people think I was crazy

153
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
And I was

154
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
I was really

155
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Worried about that

156
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
Because

157
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
You know when you say okay

158
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
A balloon ended in an open Gondola underneath

159
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
The first thing people think about it

160
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
They say

161
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,919
Can you remember that guy who went up in a balloon in a lawn chair

162
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
Lawnchair Larry

163
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
Crazy dude

164
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
That's exactly what people think

165
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
But not everyone

166
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
Cameron is attract

167
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
Small team of

168
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Student volunteer

169
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
Who are committed to making

170
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
The technology of space travel

171
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
More except

172
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
In the spring of 2013

173
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
They started doing we

174
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
Shiprock

175
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,679
BG lovers 1 2 and 3 open

176
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
Who delivers 1 2 and 3 are open

177
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
They check off items on an exhaust

178
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Skip list

179
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,455
Making sure the breathing gas pressure gas and suit Cooling

180
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
When are all in place

181
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,831
The most expensive part of the suit and the only part of the sink that Cameron didn't build himself

182
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,159
Is the Soviet Air Force helmet he bought on eBay

183
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
The helmet is an exception

184
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
To my general rule of

185
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
You know I want to build it

186
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
Some things that you can easily access

187
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Score

188
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
Basically not use things

189
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
From

190
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
Production system

191
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Typically military

192
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
Production systems that have already sorted out all the problem

193
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
I didn't want to do that I want to solve the problems

194
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,431
Why I mean why reinvent the wheel these problems have presumably been solved by other people Avi

195
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
That's a great question

196
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
Why reinvent the wheel why we do the

197
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
It is any

198
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
Incredible thrill for me personally

199
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
Beat my head

200
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Against

201
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Problem and I

202
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,791
I can't figure it out and then one day I'm walking home

203
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
Or

204
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
I'm on the street

205
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Car

206
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
What's a Eureka moment

207
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,655
And it's so thrilling

208
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
I got it

209
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
I have to almost run home

210
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
And build the thing and see if

211
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
So for me

212
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
You know it's an intellectual Adventure

213
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Oh my gosh

214
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,479
I figure out the math can I mix the gas as properly can I make this thing home

215
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Pressure

216
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
Can my mind can I with my mind

217
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Solve these problems

218
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
Set a lot of fun

219
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
When Cameron puts the suit on

220
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
He starts out on the

221
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
The floor

222
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,303
He has to Regal and shimmy his way into the

223
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
The suits outer layer

224
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
So right now

225
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,935
Put my leg up like that and Ben can start getting my

226
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
My foot down

227
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,055
Then I blocked the inhale valve on the

228
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
Onm

229
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
You can inhale

230
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
But you can't exhale

231
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,943
It's a minor problem we will fix it

232
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
That doesn't sound like a minor problem

233
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
What I mean

234
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
Is that

235
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,903
The mechanism is so simple that I believe it can be fixed we just haven't got this

236
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:07,583
It turns out Cameron isn't the only one on the metaphorical floor wriggling into his homemade space suit

237
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,447
Play start a whole new radio show just about the DIY RC were trying to get themselves into space

238
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,519
There's this Danish company called Copenhagen suborbitals

239
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,359
And they're building rockets in space capsules in an abandoned Shipyard in Denver

240
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
6

241
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Mike

242
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,999
These guys have the goal of suborbital flight in mind

243
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
Like Alan Shepard bubbles go up

244
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
And come right back down again rather than orbiting the Earth was John Glenn

245
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,935
Copenhagen suborbitals and Cameron Smith

246
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
The spaceship guy

247
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
They've actually been working together

248
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:53,151
Christian von Bengston is the co-founder of Copenhagen suborbitals and he's talking to Cameron about building suits for them to use

249
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,735
Once they're ready to replace their crash test dummy with a live human being

250
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,343
Christians approach to building his Space Capsule is right in line with what Cameron is doing with her

251
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
The suit a lot of the stuff we're buying is you know the Danish equivalent to Home Depot take for example

252
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,095
The heat shields NASA has used some pretty fancy materials like reinforced

253
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
Carbon and high-purity silica fiber

254
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
Create heat shields for the shuttle another

255
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,007
The Space Capsule we have

256
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
A heat shield made of

257
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Of cork

258
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
Which is just that bored

259
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Local carpet shop

260
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Did you take cork like

261
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
Cork

262
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Exactly

263
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:33,855
And a lot of people find it funny that we use cork as an heat shield and it might be a bit funny but it's the perfect solution for it

264
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
What would be the wood base

265
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
Superlative steampunk

266
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
Tree puns

267
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
Woodpunk

268
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
Arbor Punk

269
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
Harbor Freight

270
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
I like that one

271
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Anyway

272
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,423
Both of these examples May on the surface

273
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,495
Seem as removed as possible from this league

274
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
Polished and perfectly engineered products of NASA

275
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
I mean

276
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,807
But they all possess the same problem solving genius needed to allow humans to exist environment

277
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,367
No human has any business being

278
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,695
When my favorite scenes in any movie is an Apollo 13

279
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,511
Underground base crew realizes that they have to adapt

280
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,351
Tsquared carbon dioxide air filters from one part of the ship

281
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,447
To fit into the round carbon dioxide scrubber in another part of the ship

282
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,519
Or all the astronauts 168 and die

283
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
But the scrubbers on the Command Module

284
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Kingsport Court

285
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
Montana went around

286
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,223
Tell me this isn't a government operation

287
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Sisters

288
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Contingency

289
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Remote

290
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
The CO2 levels are going to be

291
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Toxic

292
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,439
Well I suggest you gentlemen have been waiting for the square peg in a round hole

293
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,279
That's the sound of a NASA engineers

294
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,351
Throwing all the available materials on the spaceship

295
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
On a table

296
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
We got to find a way

297
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
To make this

298
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
Fit into the hole for this

299
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
Using nothing but that

300
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,503
Let's get it organized filter

301
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
When I think of Cameron I think less

302
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
Lawnchair Larry

303
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:14,975
And more 60s engineer sporting the horn rims in the short sleeve shirt with a tie

304
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
He's scaring the parts across the table

305
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
Attacking the problem

306
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
When I have to design something very specific

307
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
And I have to look to how other people have done it if I can

308
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
I can't figure it out myself

309
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Almost always it's the Russians

310
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Space suits that I'm

311
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
Modeling

312
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,407
They never had as much money

313
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
And so they had to do things in a more inventive way

314
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
Whether you're in a garage

315
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,855
Where the big company or in a gondola at 50000 ft

316
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,647
The design process is the same

317
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Research

318
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
Express the Prototype

319
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Test inside

320
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,815
But with cameras project the stakes are significant

321
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,887
We hire will be so embarrassing to get killed in it

322
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
So

323
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
I'm going to make it work

324
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,775
Notice that he said embarrassing in that sentence not

325
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Terrifying

326
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,871
Which to me sounds just like an astronaut

327

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

338
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,727
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

339
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
If

340
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:09,151
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

341
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,247
Call hearing.

342
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
Technology talk to us

343
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
It is a creation of Sonic trash

344
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,159
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

345
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,743
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

346
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
To make them more human

347
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
Turn the living room lights on

348
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Okay

349
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
Dim the living room lights to 50

350
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
2%

351
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Okay

352
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,431
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

353
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,247
Makes for a much more natural experience

354
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
Turn the living room lights on

355
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,391
Dim the living room lights to 50%

About how are soundscape is impacting our health

358
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,191
And how we can humanize the sounds around us
