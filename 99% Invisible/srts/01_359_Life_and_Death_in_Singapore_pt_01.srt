1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
This is 99% invisible

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,328
I'm Roman Mars

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,912
In 1959

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
After nearly a century-and-a-half of British colonial rule

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:14,080
People of Singapore took the first step toward their independence

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,152
They voted to run their own internal governor

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:24,320
British colonial rule was restored after the second World War

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:29,440
A series of colonial administrators have ruled and ordered our lives

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,352
Well times have changed

10
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,168
Top decided to run the Affairs of Singapore

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,216
It was a joyous moment

12
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,776
But they inherited a difficult situation

13
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312
All of us

14
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,616
Wanda better and a fuller life

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,712
But a rise in the standard of living of all people

16
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,016
Cannot be created overnight

17
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:58,368
Singapore was bombed heavily by Japan during the second World War

18
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,952
And again by the Allies after Singapore fell to the Japanese

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,048
A lot of it infrastructure was in Ruins including the port

20
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:11,168
Which it brought foreign goods and a multi-ethnic multilingual population of people

21
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,704
To the island for centuries

22
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,008
No Port meant no jobs

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
Poverty was rampant

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,640
Most of the Island's residents were living in unpermitted makeshift houses

25
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,456
Crammed into crowded Villages throughout the island

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
If you don't know

27
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
The country of Singapore is

28
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
Tiny

29
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,624
Trading tarnation is really just one city

30
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,208
It takes less than 45 minutes to drive across the island

31
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
With traffic

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
But in the 1950s

33
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
There were Village

34
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,376
And those Villages were known as components

35
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,656
A local Malay word

36
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
Best producer Katie Thornton

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,496
She's a Fulbright National Geographic

38
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,312
Big fellow and has spent the last four months in Singapore

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,872
Compone communities were strong

40
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
Close knit

41
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,200
What's an easy

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,784
Multiple families might share one toilet or one kitchen

43
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,856
The compounds relied on gas for lighting

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,952
And most houses were made of super flammable Palm

45
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,976
Norwood

46
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
With roofs made of sheet metal

47
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:15,168
The government wanted to raise the quality of life for the people they rebuilt the port and created factory jobs they made

48
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
All the kids learn English so that Singapore could feel United under one language but the biggest undertaking of all

49
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,664
What's to get the people out of thatched roof Huts in into modern house

50
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:31,296
And one of the biggest challenges would be doing it with extremely limited land space

51
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,880
In 1960s they formed the housing and develop

52
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
Bored or hdb

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
I'm just 5 years later

54
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,536
It already has 400000

55
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,096
Well over 400 thousand people

56
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
Singapore's population

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,240
I've been be hotter than the last five years and these bright mother Mary plant

58
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
Nowhere in the world

59
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,824
West Germany

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,640
Is the rate of rehousing faster than in Singapore

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
By going vertical

62
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,368
When planning for growing population most urban planners

63
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
Expand their cities outward

64
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,208
But in land limited Singapore

65
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
That is not an option

66
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,840
Today Singapore tallest public housing buildings are 50 stories high

67
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
The tallest in the world

68
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
From the very beginning

69
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,472
The Housing and Development board went vertical

70
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,800
The people of Singapore demand high standards

71
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,896
Are there prepared to work hard and a capable of high Skittles

72
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,688
But then the sky is the limit

73
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,296
Singapore is acquiring one Hallmark of a great civilized community

74
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,440
Magnificent buildings

75
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Today

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,304
Singapore is the third richest nation in the world

77
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,376
And 80% of singaporeans still live in East

78
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,424
Tall cement hdb Flats

79
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,008
There's about 10000 public housing buildings on the island

80
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,568
A new flats are going up all the time

81
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,712
It's not the glitzy futuristic Singapore Skyline UC and movies like crazy rich Asian

82
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,272
The buildings are tall and cement

83
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,856
How to block numbers on the side

84
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:15,488
Helping singaporeans locate themselves in the monotonous city of nearly identical building

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
Throughout the 1960s and 70s

86
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,471
Hdb public housing developments sprung up all over the country

87
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,799
Who is Moon as a historian in Singapore

88
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
She was born in 1960

89
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,407
Has lived in hdb flats for most of her life

90
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,503
She remembers watching this house in crop up everywhere on the Isle

91
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
They weren't all designed exactly the same

92
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
Pretty close

93
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,903
Design style is different

94
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,743
But what doesn't change is basically everything become like a matchbox

95
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
So you're leaving in a little

96
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Hole

97
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
Insight

98
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
Concrete structure

99
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:58,239
As people moved into these crab concrete Towers a lot of the missed the vibe of their old community

100
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,799
What they called the compound spirit

101
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
But there was a lot to like about their new homes

102
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,455
Like having their own bathrooms and kitchens with electricity and Plumbing

103
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
A place where they can have their own

104
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
Privacy

105
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,391
A place where they don't get flooded every time it rains

106
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
And so people moved in

107
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
And the government kept building

108
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,559
And that the beauty just keep getting higher

109
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Over the years

110
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,167
But despite the Privacy that architecture afforded

111
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
Yvonne didn't always feel alone

112
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
As a kid growing up in age

113
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
Hdb Flats

114
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
She remembers seeing shadowy figures

115
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
Floating above her bed

116
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
She asked her mom about it

117
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
So when I was very young

118
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
I told my mom

119
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
I say

120
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:45,343
Why is it that I see that you may just above me and then she said

121
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,671
Silly go this used to be a cemetery

122
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,511
Of the four Apartments even has lived in

123
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,815
Two of them have been on Old cemeteries

124
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,119
Might seem like bad luck

125
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
But in Singapore where land is scarce

126
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:05,311
It's not unlikely for apartment buildings to be built on land that was graveyards not too long ago

127
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,407
But building on top of a graveyard has his complications

128
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
And in one Cemetery

129
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
Call PacSun tank

130
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,295
The new Housing Development disrupted more than just the Dead

131
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,111
It disrupted a way of life

132
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,975
Yeah I'm a Pawn on you King

133
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,535
Growing up in the 50s and 60s

134
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
Mr. Kwan was a city boy

135
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,935
But his dad would bring him to eight miles from their home near Singapore's growing city sensor

136
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
The overgrown rainforest

137
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Apex Center

138
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
To pray at the graves

139
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Our family and

140
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
Killable youngboy

141
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
Wandering around

142
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
The Hillside Cinema

143
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
Walking through the grass

144
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,599
We we say prayers beaming offerings

145
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
Mr. Khan's family was Chinese

146
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
And they believed that if the dead were well taken

147
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,511
Care of it not only my peace for the Departed

148
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
It could also bring the wrecked

149
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
The Descendants

150
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,143
So Mister contest going as he got older

151
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,983
I'm going to the cemetery wasn't just a family affair it was a

152
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
Community

153
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Function

154
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311
Chinese migrants to Singapore

155
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:15,711
Set up Social Service organizations to help take care of their Community from the Cradle to the Grave and Beyond

156
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
Mr. Quan in his friends

157
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,599
Would wander the Untamed hillsides to the graves of their long-dead community

158
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,647
Members there they burn incense

159
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
Fake paper money

160
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
Things they thought that the dead might need in the afterlife

161
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
And then

162
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
They just hang out at the grave

163
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,631
So after the order prayers are said and done

164
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
We have a lovely meal of roast pork

165
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,519
Roast duck Sinnoh and so on and

166
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,103
It was a wonderful year and I when we kiss look

167
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
But you did actually

168
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,967
When you hear mr. Quan talk about going to the cemetery

169
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,015
You start to get why he enjoyed it

170
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
It was a nice change from the congestion

171
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Cement

172
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
The city

173
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,415
And it wasn't just a natural scenery that was impressive

174
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
The tombs were amazing

175
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,535
People would spend a fortune on big elaborate Memorial

176
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
Stone lions and meticulous

177
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
Carving

178
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,911
Accenting Cemetery with sprawling

179
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
With these

180
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
Huge ornate tune

181
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,263
Lease at least 30 meters

182
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
30 meters brownies

183
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
Issue is about 33 yards you know

184
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
30 m wide

185
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,015
That could easily be bigger than a 3-bedroom hdb apartment

186
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Today

187
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,111
Mr Quan is describing just a single family grave

188
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
On top of that

189
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
Text Anthony had a lot of shared Graves

190
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:34,303
One big Tombstone with Marcus huge area where members of a professional or social group

191
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
Burberry together

192
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,143
I packed something there was lots for all sorts of

193
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
We have elected

194
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
Retailers Association

195
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
Tupac's Atlas Associates

196
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
The opera singers Association

197
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
The

198
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
I mean you need me

199
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,687
An ideal Chinese tomb is supposed to be on a hill

200
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
So that the fortunes of the deceased

201
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,015
Can rundown

202
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
The future Generations

203
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
In China and in the Chinese diaspora

204
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
Stewart's Hill and Cemetery

205
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
Interchange

206
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
Saint of pets n Things

207
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Means Health

208
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,167
The name translates to Pavilions on the Jade Hills a reference to the graveyards 12 covered structures

209
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,007
Where visitors could rest and eat after making offerings of the grave

210
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
Mr. Quan Remember Izzy's Pavilions well

211
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,639
But that doesn't mean he knew his way around the graveyard

212
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
With all those grand tombs the cemetery was enormous

213
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,015
324 Acres

214
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
That's about four times the size of Disneyland

215
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
And a country half

216
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
The size of LA

217
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Sometimes

218
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,511
The driver of the Basel the lorry

219
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
Bringing us that would lose his way

220
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,447
We have to get some of the Villagers to come and guide us

221
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:50,591
When Mr Quan says they will get villagers to come out and guide them doesn't mean people from a nearby Village

222
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
He needs people

223
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Live

224
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
In the graveyard

225
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
So people were kind of

226
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
Living among the tombstones is that correct

227
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Yes yes

228
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Yes

229
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Text Santa

230
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,439
Was in fact a cemetery full of life

231
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,743
It was a self-sufficient Village

232
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,815
It's that began almost a hundred years before Mr Quan started

233
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
And members of Singapore's growing Cantonese

234
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,703
Is community realized I needed more space to bury their dead

235
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
They purchase land on what was then the edge of

236
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Shifthound

237
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
And as the cemetery grew

238
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
So did the village

239
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,919
An active graveyard meant there were jobs to be had

240
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,479
Graves had to be dug tombstones carved

241
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Refreshments sold to mourners

242
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,599
Show people built that group homes right there among the graves

243
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,671
It's actually happened in a lot of big Cemetery sets

244
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
Sprawled across a tiny Isle

245
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
The living just kind of

246
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
List alongside the Dead

247
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,887
By the 1970s Peck SanTan Village at almost 2000 Reznor

248
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,983
There was a large Chinese style gate at the entrance to the Village

249
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,799
Debilitated Town Clinic convenience stores with

250
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:57,151
That's Tintin Rouge there was a popular coffee shop and a dim-sum Eatery

251
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:02,527
And an open-air movie theater where people set under their umbrellas to watch films in the rain

252
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,855
Many of the residents work at a soy sauce factory in the village

253
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
Livestock was weird kids

254
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,951
Airborne and families race

255
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
All among the graves

256
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
Say what

257
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,607
I used to hang around a coffee shop

258
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Ronda Rousey

259
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Play

260
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
Play with marbles

261
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Gumbo

262
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
That's Mister Lee

263
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
He just goes by Lee

264
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,079
And he grew up and text dancing Village

265
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
Ikids anywhere else on the island

266
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,663
And he climbs fruit trees and

267
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Play hopscotch with his neighbor

268
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
The house was just a

269
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
A few houses over from the nearest grapes

270
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
Leave wasn't afraid to be living so close to

271
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
To the Dead

272
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,743
He did hear ghost stories

273
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
Since I was a child

274
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
All the people say

275
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,887
Ghost

276
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
Everywhere you go

277
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:57,567
Where was room

278
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
How many people died

279
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
Pulled Under by Whitley cause water goes

280
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:05,247
Attunement Pavilion 5 boasted to large Stone lion

281
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,855
Villagers would always complain that they came to life after dark and ate their chicken

282
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,415
But to lie and other villagers

283
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Accenting

284
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
Was home

285
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
However

286
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
Life in a cemetery

287
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Was about to change

288
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:24,703
As the hdb built more and more housing for Singapore's growing population

289
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
They realized

290
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
They needed more land

291
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,079
The Prime Minister explained it well

292
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,639
You don't have enough land for the living

293
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
The Dead mask

294
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
If we do the

295
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:43,135
1973 the government said there'd be no more ground Burial at over 70 Cemetery

296
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
Including percentage

297
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
A 1974

298
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,023
Those who died could only be buried at the

299
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,327
Single more sterile government runs

300
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,887
Cemetery 16 miles from the city center

301
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
Or for a fraction of the price

302
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
Could be cremated

303
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,311
Their ashes scattered or stored in a small

304
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Iron

305
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,639
These were huge cultural changes

306
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
Not everyone was happy

307
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,271
But after the war in the nation's Independence a lot of singaporeans

308
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,575
We're willing to make sacrifice

309
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
Prices for the country's development

310
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:19,743
Acknowledge that burying people in big Graves just wasn't sustainable on a tiny Island

311
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,815
Also I kind of had to go along with the changes

312
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,631
Singapore has really limited freedom of speech

313
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,215
So when the government tells you to do something you don't have much choice

314
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
In 1978

315
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
It happened

316
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,151
The pet sensing Cemetery Association received a letter from the government

317
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
Saying a new

318
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
High-rise public housing development

319
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,759
What's going to be built on the cemetery

320
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
Their land was being rude

321
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,647
Remember they're basically two groups of people at Exxon thing

322
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
The dead and the living

323
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,719
And both were told that

324
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Add four years to clear out

325
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:57,631
The people living in Pakistan think we're mostly relocated into new government housing nearby

326
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
But it took a while

327
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
A lot of the villagers weren't happy to leave

328
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,287
And they stayed as long as they possibly could

329
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,103
Sometimes a year is past the deadline the government gave them

330
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
To move

331
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
As for the Dead

332
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
In the association of family members who represented

333
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
They were eager to move either

334
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
Association wanted to find a way to

335
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,599
The keep a piece of their land

336
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
But no the longest

337
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Prettiest

338
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
No more land area means no more

339
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
Len Barry

340
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
So that was it

341
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
So they hired a lawyer

342
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,143
And pleaded with the government to let them keep just

343
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,471
30 Acres of their original 324

344
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,543
Enough to have a temple and some administrative buildings

345
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
And to cremate

346
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
And build a columbarium

347
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
A building made to hold urns

348
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,735
Then all the sudden One Fine Day receive a letter

349
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
We wanted

350
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
30 Acres

351
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
And did what

352
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Back to us

353
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
Antidote

354
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
We can only

355
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
Spell you a Takis

356
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
To the committee met and decide

357
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,303
It because better than the waitress

358
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,399
8 Acres was more than most Cemetery Scott

359
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
At least there would be room for a columbarium

360
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
A couple of other buildings

361
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,079
Still a hundred thousand bodies would have to be dug up from the cemetery

362
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
It was a huge daunting task

363
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
Lovi Poe

364
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,247
The advertisements in the newspaper

365
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
Telangana so common

366
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,599
Kiera Hogan

367
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
I wanted to use a whip

368
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Basically

369
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
Resume degrees

370
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:32,607
They wrote letters to the families asking them to remove their good loved ones from what was about to be a construction site

371
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
But as the deadline approached

372
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Only about half

373
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,495
Lansing's 100000 Graves had been on Earth

374
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:44,639
Bee Association members were at a loss as to what to do with a nearly 50,000 body still in the ground

375
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:49,503
Who would pay to dig up the graves cremate the bodies and give them another resting place

376
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,087
Association explain their predicament the Housing and Development

Bacb and the cemetery Association hired people from the village to dig up the bodies

382
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
People like mr. Lee

Carrying their Spades and tools

387
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:24,575
He studied how they remove the heavy soil from the grave and carefully broke the coffin

388
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Then

389
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
He was ready to do it himself

390
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,487
Android

391
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,559
The Bones have sunken into the Earth

To find a bones

395
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Sometimes

396
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
Hello work is easy

397
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,799
We may spend about an hour looking at a tome

398
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Pizza Hut job

399
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
3 to 4 hours

400
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
At first we was scared to dig

401
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,575
Any of the bodies were only just starting

402
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
How to decompose

403
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,975
Papillon

404
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,023
Icons on the shame to say it

405
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,839
Three criteria to be in this job

406
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
Bus

407
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
You have to have the Gaga

408
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
Second

409
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Strength

410
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
The skill

411
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
So if you have no gas

412
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,847
That's the way you can do this job

413
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
After going to work on the hill

414
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
Diane and day out

415
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,479
She got the guts

416
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
Receipt

417
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,087
Again whooping are you on

418
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
Is futile to be frightened

419
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,695
You need to fulfill your application

420
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,999
Even if I'm frightened and alone

421
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
Istick need to complete the job

422
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
And he did

423
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,655
After years of begging

424
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,959
The 100000 bodies were all rooms

425
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,567
The half that were unclaimed were cremated together and Scattered at sea

426
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
And a solemn ceremony

427
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,175
Like many other living members of X and things

428
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,759
Lee and his family were re how stand in your buy hdds

429
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,831
Promotes the villagers the transition wasn't easy

430
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,927
Sure their housing was taken care of but you couldn't have a form in RI

431
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,743
Splatoon Stone carving Business Without burial

432
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
Libras lucky

433
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,095
He found work digging up other nearby cemeteries

434
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
That were also getting repossessed

435
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,239
Text something had been able to hold on to a taker

436
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
It was more than most people got

437
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
But wasn't much

438
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,943
Going from a 324 Acres Cemetery to 1/8 acre complex

439
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,783
The temple administration building in a columbarium for urns

440
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
Myspace had to be Maxima

441
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
There was also the issue of design Aesthetics

442
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,743
Foremost Chinese the tradition was Dewberry in Grand tombs

443
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
Like the ones at xen thing

444
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
When it came to building the columbarium.

445
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
Allstate Insurance

446
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,887
There's no real model

447
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
Harken back to

448
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,215
Columbariums were novel structure

449
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,799
Because the whole practice of cremation was pretty new to a lot of Chinese

450
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
Singaporean

451
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,663
Just 20 years earlier only 10% of the country's Chinese population

452
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Mission was cremated

453
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,271
But by the time pek Sansing wanted to build their columbarium

454
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
That number was almost 70

455
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,159
Without much by way of architectural precedent for the columbarium

456
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,719
Apex hunting Association took a Gamble

457
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:16,351
They chose a somewhat controversial architect who cut his teeth designing brutalist superstructures

458
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
A modernist nametake hang soon

459
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
That project was

460
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:25,055
An interesting moment for me because I've been thinking about the problem of form

461
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
How do you

462
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,127
How do you modernize

463
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
And yet respect

464
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,759
The the traditions and the history and the

465
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
And Aesthetics of the bus

466
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
You certainly didn't want to build a warehouse

467
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:43,999
For the dad that he said would be antithetical to the quote nature loving and fengshui oriented ethos

468
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
A Chinese Berry

469
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,119
But it was days of problem of how to accommodate the number of

470
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
Nothing. Have to be

471
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,495
Interact within the columbarium

472
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,823
And so just like the Housing and Development board did when faced

473
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
The issue of overcrowding

474
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Mr. tape

475
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Belt

476
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Up

477
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:08,319
From the outside it almost looks like any other new multi-story construction for the living

478
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,135
Before the columbarium opened in 1986

479
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,207
One newspaper said it could easily be mistaken

480
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
Bruh flashy new condominium

481
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
But the inside

482
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Was different

483
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:23,423
Mr. T's columbarium stretches up over about nine different staggered levels

484
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,543
The building Rises gently the series of cascading stories and half stories

485
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
Forming cement pills

486
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
Like traditional Chinese tombs

487
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,687
The large windows and Skylight corridors

488
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
Made it sunny

489
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Panera

490
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
Burns line the wall

491
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
From floor to ceiling

492
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:47,231
There was a waiting list of over 20,000 urns from the cemetery ready to move into pecs entangle and Bear

493
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,047
But nearby housing units for the living

494
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,351
Weren't so quick to get sold

495
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,239
As promised those hdb Flats were going up all over the grounds that are filled with dead bodies just

496
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
Couple years earlier

497
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
They called the development

498
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
Bichon

499
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,615
A mandarin version of the Cantonese

500
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
PacSun

501
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
Or Jade Hills

502
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,783
The new bishan development had everything the hdb imagined people needed

503
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
They opened a train stop

504
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,903
What Singapore cause Mass rapid transit or MRT

505
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
There were schools

506
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,000
Malls entertainment and easy access to the city

507
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
In other words

508
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,072
It was my ideal place to live

509
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
Except

510
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
For one thing

511
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
The ghost

512
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,240
Newspapers wrote about ghost sightings in bishan

513
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,592
The new MRT station there was known to be haunted by ghosts in the cemetery

514
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,896
Like apparently it was just common knowledge

515
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:42,528
Did you hear any stories

516
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
Everybody

517
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
China voice

518
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Getting

519
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Especially

520
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
The last train at night

521
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,280
There were reports of a ghostly woman who boarded the last

522
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
Train at bishan

523
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,400
And without Fanfare took off her head and put it on the

524
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Next to her

525
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
Some passengers were known

526
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
Cast no reflection

527
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
On the train windows

528
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
Many of the residents who did move in

529
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,688
Didn't want any additional reminders of their neighborhoods McCobb history

530
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,760
The one tangible piece of evidence remain

531
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,064
One of the cemeteries covered Pavilion

532
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,368
Still stood near the new train station

533
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,976
Until the placenta Association got a call from the Housing and Development board

534
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
About

535
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
Shadows

536
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Decedent

537
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
The races have been completed

538
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,632
They see Shadows at night

539
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
Around the Pavilion

540
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
Creepy

541
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
Ghostly shadow

542
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
What Shadows are they

543
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,848
I would like to stay one like that and then in the sea what are the Shadows

544
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:45,248
This coming really we were prepared to bring a cup of coffee and stay one night

545
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
Happy Davido Shadows

546
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,624
Dhdb told them the Pavilion would be demolished

547
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
Dissociation knew they had no say

548
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
The government already on the land

549
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,000
I had to oblige

550
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
Even if some of them weren't happy

551
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
The demolisher

552
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,376
Wasn't that funny voice acting

553
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
The last remaining structure

554
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
Optics hunting

555
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
To be demolished

556
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
And with that

557
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,104
All the physical remnants from the graveyard we're gone from the landscape

558
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,920
Cemetery was no longer a cemetery

559
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
It was a huge Urban Development

560
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,064
The multi-storey columbarium that people could easily avoid

561
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
If they wanted to

562
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
And

563
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
People forgot

564
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,744
QuickTime Bichon became an appealing place to live

565
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
Because he's already pregnant

566
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,840
I think the economic

567
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
Ahmad over rice

568
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,216
The spirituality behind so to speak, let's put it that way

569
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
People

570
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,032
Forget that this was a cemetery before

571
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,872
Many of the younger generation didn't even know of

572
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,456
Pick something symmetry really wants us there living on Summertree Lane

573
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,040
Many many other singaporeans live

574
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,856
On Old cemeteries whether they know it or not

575
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:58,720
So many other cemeteries were cleared for development and it still going on

576
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
Right now

577
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,888
Losing the cemeteries has forced a total one-eighty and how a lot of singaporeans think about dying

578
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,216
The first government crematorium opened in the early

579
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,776
60s about for cremations a week

580
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:16,128
Now more than 80% of singaporeans are cremated when they die

581
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,456
Substantially more than the US where that number is just over

582
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:24,064
50% and all of those Traditions that people like Mystic wanted

583
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,880
Burning offerings at having a feast at the grave

584
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,928
It had to be way down size

585
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
Lights to fit into the

586
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
The tight hallways

587
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
The columbarium

588
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,840
Today Singapore has for government-run columbarium

589
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:40,960
Pecan bariums also don't meet everyone's needs because they only house cremated from

590
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,032
Chinese are the ethnic majority in Singapore

591
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
35% of the population

592
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,920
And the country's Hindu Community as long practice cremation

593
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:55,552
But most of the country's large male Community practices Islam which doesn't permit cremation

594
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,416
So in 2007 the Singapore government implemented their new Crypt

595
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
Ariel sister

596
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,536
It's a prefabricated series of interlocking concrete walls

597
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
Like a deathly grid

598
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,376
Assembled above ground and then sunk into the Earth

599
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,448
But you only get 15 years in your own grave

600
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,496
Now you have to be consolidated

601
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,288
Ab216 bodies

602
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
Per grade

603
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,360
All this rearranging of the Dead

604
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,664
Has been a painful change for a lot

605
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Singaporean

606
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,760
But there was also a widespread understanding

607
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:30,880
But something had to give in order to get so many people their own homes

608
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,672
On such a tiny Island

609
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
And

610
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,768
Let us be practical I mean

611
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,352
Symmetry Boutique

612
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Couch Lance Bass

613
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
End

614
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
Deadline space

615
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,032
In my opinion

616
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
Must be sacrificed

617
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,176
And the Singaporean people did sacrifice

618
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
Not just the land

619
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:00,064
But centuries of rituals and traditions for their debt

620
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
All ticket homes

621
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
For the living

622
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:20,288
This cultural shift happen without a lot of resistance from the Singaporean people

623
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
But that is changing

624
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,640
I will talk to Katie Thornton about that

625
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
After the break

626
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,808
So I'm in the studio with Katie Thornton and I want to follow up on

627
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
What things are like

628
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
In Singapore today

629
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
I would almost everyone

630
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,720
Has some form of housing will there be

631
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
Public or private

632
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,816
Today there's a lot of infrastructure for

633
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,936
And there are only a few historic cemeteries left in the entire country

634
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,776
And all of them are slated to be developed

635
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,056
So like it still

636
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,616
They're still trying to take as much of that land is

637
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
Is possible

638
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:01,504
Yeah totally so like there's one other Cemetery that has actually been getting a lot of

639
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
Attention lately

640
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,112
It's called bukit Brown and it's another Chinese Cemetery

641
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:11,744
A lot of prominent early Chinese Singaporean businesspeople and philanthropist are buried at bukit Brown

642
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
There are a ton of those

643
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,352
Cornet tombstones like the one with the Quan describe

644
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
At the site

645
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,680
What are you going to do about those

646
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,984
Well in 2011

647
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,776
The government announced that they're going to

648
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,312
Expand a highway

649
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:30,432
Right through the cemetery and that Highway opened earlier this year

650
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:35,552
They had to remove 4000 Graves and a lot of the Tombstones were thrown away

651
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:40,416
And just like that text something the government said that they had to come and clear out the graves

652
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,720
Or the remains will be scattered at sea

653
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,840
Pretty upset like at this point is one of the only remaining cemeteries

654
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
Indian Tire

655
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:55,008
Country bunch of volunteers story instead of advocating for the preservation of the society leading tours and academics.

656
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
Involves and documenting the space

657
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
And it really spoke to people like

658
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
Grumman do you remember Hoon

659
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,200
Yes she was the

660
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,248
The person that was in the peace that

661
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,064
Was historian but she saw ghosts when she was a

662
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
The kid

663
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,136
Yeah totally would she just mentioned

664
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:16,256
Lake very casually

665
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,584
She had this job at the time she's working for a theater company and choose

666
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
He's doing a lot of traveling around

667
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,192
And sometimes when she was traveling should go and visit big like

668
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,264
Famous Destination type of cemetery

669
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,848
Eminem Road was announced she was like Hey I've never been to poop

670
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,176
Brown maybe I'll check it out I mean it's my own backyard

671
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,480
And then she went and it was like

672
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
Cut

673
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Scene change

674
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,088
She totally changed her career

675
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,904
And why was this the thing that really really

676
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,464
Mater want to change everything what is she

677
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Care so much

678
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:51,328
For some reason it just didn't really sit well with her that people who never play

679
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:55,936
Planned on being cremated and thrown into the sea might end up there

680
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,032
So she just wanted families to know if they had ancestors buried at 3

681
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:06,432
Because a lot of people had lost track so she quit her job and she put together all these family trees

682
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Menchie's

683
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,992
Cold call The Descendants

684
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:14,624
And tell them that a grave of say their great-grandmother was going to be dug up

685
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,976
Remember Graves where she was like so sure that you could find The Descendants

686
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:25,120
But you would talk to the government and be like please wait wait like don't think up this tomb yet I can find the family

687
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:29,216
And then she would and should stay in touch with them and help them throughout

688
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,752
The whole process

689
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,800
Stand alongside the family is us

690
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
They dug the body

691
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,360
He's up and move them elsewhere

692
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,408
And she still doing it

693
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,968
Even after the road opened earlier this year

694
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,272
She's still working to document the space

695
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,856
She's been living off her savings for 8 years to do the work

696
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,184
Because she's worried that the rest of the cemetery is going to be developed

697
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,232
And also history will be lost

698
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,304
But she does think that there was

699
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,608
A time where maybe it made

700
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,448
Sense to develop over these faces to get living people's needs Med

701
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
But

702
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,264
The times a little bit different now

703
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
Like I asked her I asked you in about text hunting

704
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,640
And I'll tell you a little bit of tape about what she said

705
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,224
Yeah at the point at that point I'm definitely I mean

706
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,016
Uuuuu

707
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
Go for

708
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,112
Having high rise building to house.

709
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904
People rather than to have

710
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,440
Cemetery for the Dead

711
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,280
Yes I'd like at that time she definitely saw it as

712
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:28,608
FedEx change indirect exchange between the living and the dead

713
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
But you feel like times are kind of

714
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,448
Different now like men might be possible to

715
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,216
Preserve

716
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,288
View old spaces on the island

717
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,848
So again like this is what she said about that

718
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,152
There was a need for it before

719
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,200
Is test you that need now

720
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,040
You know so it's like it is like

721
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,088
If this is gone and erase

722
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,928
Not replaceable and irreversible

723
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,512
We are talking about retaining a part of our heritage

724
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
You know

725
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
Did your opinion

726
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
About

727
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
The role of cemeteries

728
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
In life change

729
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,848
I think that cemeteries are these interesting and complicated historic sites there

730
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,640
Kind of an opportunity

731
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
4

732
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,456
People to inscribe

733
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:21,600
Their history on the landscape there's certainly like Rife with exclusions as well

734
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,904
People that excluded from Cemetery spaces

735
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,464
Based on their race based on their religion

736
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,024
Based on their class and their inability to access

737
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
Sammy like a large

738
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
Tombstone

739
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,096
But I think it's
