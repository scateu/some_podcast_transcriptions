00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,968
Basically what Kennedy is saying here is it's a real possibility that bombs are going to start falling and

51
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,576
We need to figure out where you can all go to take shelter if they do

52
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,368
That's producer Katie Mingle

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,696
And after Kennedy made this horrifying speech

54
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
As you can imagine

55
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Phones

56
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Started ringing

57
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,888
Immediately the Kennedy administration was besieged by people

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,704
Wanting more information on

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472

Experts at building shelters

65
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:09,696
They were door-to-door bomb shelter salesman shelter displays at malls in county fairs

66
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,256
But by the time Kennedy made that 1961 speech

67
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,328
There was one place that already broken ground

68
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
Funny unique shelter

69
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
Artesia New Mexico population 11000 is about 40 miles south of Roswell in the southern part

State near Texas

71
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,640
And in 1962 they opened a brand-new Elementary

72
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
Trade school

73
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
Completely Underground

Because the school it was built to double

77
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
Of the town's nuclear fallout

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
This was a

79
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
Pilot program

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560

81
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,144

84
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,032
During an attack to school

85
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,848
Supposedly with shelter it's on students

86
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
And those from other schools

87
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,480
Or the first 2100 people to show up

88
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,808
And those who arrived late at the school

89
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,416
Which lines are entry blocked by 1800 Town steel doors

00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
What is going on

96
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,175
Let me explain I went to Artesia

97
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,735
And because small towns are amazing

98
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
Invited me to come on their local radio

99
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
Ksvp

100
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
And put a call out for

101
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,671
Are people who have gone ABO elementary school as

102
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,839
Good deal self anybody is has information or stories you want to share about Apple and then tribute

103
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,887
Student there were administrator or

104
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,983
Maybe you worked on or whatever give Kitty call once again her phone number is

105
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,383
Do people actually call you yeah they did and we'll meet one of them later but first let's go look at the school

106
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,063
Abu is tucked away in a quiet little neighborhood not too far away from the center of town

107
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,671
You can easily miss it driving by since it's mostly Underground

108
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,767
But there is a sign out front and you have to squint to make it out

109
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
But it says

110
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
ABO Elementary School

111
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,655
And fallout shelter and that's course original on there

112
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
That's Scott

113
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
Timer my name is Scott siemer

114
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:33,567
And I'm currently the director of maintenance for the public schools for Artesia Public Schools

115
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
I met Scott and Thad Phillips

116
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,687
The current assistant superintendent of Artesia schools

117
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
On the roof

118
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
Of ABO

119
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,831
The school is closed now but kids doing school there until 1995

120
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:51,231
The roof of Apple school is a concrete blacktop at ground level with basketball hoops and 3 cupboards

121
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,071
Stairways that go down underground and into the school

122
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,911
Like if you're in first grade you went down this this set of doors if you're in

123
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,215
Second third you come over here

124
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,775
And then 4th and 5th graders would line up at this one

125
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:10,431
One mother described the scene of kids entering the building as looking like ants lining up to go into there and he'll

126
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:15,551
Got in bad actually both went to school at a bow in the late 70s early 80s

127
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:21,951
And they said that even though the sign out front says fallout shelter and even though their school was entirely

128
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,791
Really underground they never really knew what that meant

129
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,655
I never knew growing up that it was a

130
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,263
Built as a bomb shelter was just a school to me is a kid you know

131
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,591
And then once you get older and you if you you know you hear stories and

132
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
All these to have a morgue down here and

133
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
Hubbell Elementary was designed by an architect and civil defense Enthusiast named Franks and hard

134
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:53,951
After he built ABO school he went on to design an underground shopping mall / bomb shelter that was

135
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,255
Never actually built

136
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,559
There's a this is our shower room

137
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
It's the

138
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
Contaminants off of you before you come into the rest of the people on the ground

139
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,055
The decontamination showers at each entrance were easy to miss

140
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,639
As where the blast doors which were swimming up against the wall

141
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
And not used

142
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
Starting normal

143
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
School days

144
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
Solid steel door

145
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
You can close it then it has

146
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,391
3 four different types of latches to latch

147
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
So nobody can get in or out

148
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
I never knew that

149
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
This door just until I start to work

150
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,655
We go down a couple flights of stairs into the main hallway of

151
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
School

152
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
Basically

153
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Just looks like a school

154
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
I mean it's windowless

155
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,383
I'm kind of drab since it hasn't been used in almost 20 years

156
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,199
But otherwise it looks a bit like others

157
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
Schools Acton in

158
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:53,599
Kitchen area whenever you came to lunch from the classes you always came to this door

159
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
Now you see back there they had a big

160
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
Stage back there where we put on our productions for

161
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
I was in a few plays

162
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:05,119
During during great school so that's what that's where it all happened

163
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,983
The kids at elbow actually got to vote on what the school mascot would be

164
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
Inappropriately

165
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
And adorably

166
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,079
They chose to be

167
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
The ABO gophers

168
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,455
But yeah we're underground just like the Gophers are and so

169
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
Right through here is

170
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
Our generator room

171
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,623
To keep it up and running for the

172
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,439
People that are coming in inhabitants or whatever

173
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,743
Townspeople that are coming here for the Fallout

174
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,303
It also has right over here in the corner Tumwater well

175
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
Underground

176
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
And as you can tell right here

177
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,167
You got door you got close at 1

178
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
Survival open listen for survival

179
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,311
And you're sitting ventilation shafts and open ventilation shafts and trying to keep

180
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
Batter out of

181
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:54,271
Scott and sad weren't sure which room doubled as the morgue

182
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
The elevator

183
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,343
That's what I heard there's a little room but it did

184
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
I didn't ever see where it go

185
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
You know what tremendous number of bodies

186
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
What is the typical classroom

187
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,303
Turn there's not any windows or not any sunlight

188
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
But

189
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
We went upstairs

190
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
Two three times a day for

191
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
The recreation

192
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,871
The teachers reported that they generally like her school because the students weren't distracted by starting out

193
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,711
All the windows and I think the students themselves were generally proud

194
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
Hauser School

195
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
But once again this creates a huge debate with many people saying that the needs of schools

196
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,743
And I need to shelter people during a nuclear attack or not come

197
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,583
That's kind of throws again author of One Nation

198
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Underground

199
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
And he says in fact there was a lot of debate

200
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
Going on at the time about Fallout

201
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,287
The subject was virtually in Escape

202
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
Football in the early nice

203
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
Every newspaper was running

204
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
Articles on shelters

205
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Potential for

206
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
Survival Time Magazine published

207
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,415
An article called guns I neighbor in which they interviewed a guy who said

208
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:09,279
Chattanooga's neighbors tried to get into a fallout shelter during a nuclear attack

209
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
He would kill them

210
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
Today you can watch shows like Doomsday Preppers on cable TV I think about what it would be like to prepare for the upon

211
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,719
Michael Epps but in the 1950s and 60s

212
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
It was a brand new idea

213
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,583
Also back then it wasn't a fringe idea

214
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,143
I mean the president of the United States

215
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,191
I was telling people to build these things

216
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,263
And the whole country was involved in the debate

217
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
On one side of the debate

218
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
You had people against shelters

219
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
Those against shelter sad

220
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
That you're

221
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:04,575
People who burnt burrowed into the ground to save their own skins were no better than moles or gophers

222
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:09,695
Shelters would militarize America and turn the United States into a Garrison

223
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
State

224
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,279
And after the nuclear war had ended

225
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,839
Shelters would sort of the Americas pyramid

226
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,375
All That Remains

227
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Wasted

228
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
Define civilize

229
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,519
And on the other side people for shelter said

230
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Wait a minute

231
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
This is just a precaution

232
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
Like any other

233
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
They compared Fallout shelters to Lifeboat

234
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:36,063
Here's a sarcastic letter that a proponent of shelters wrote to the Harvard Crimson in 1961

235
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,159
It's been brought to our attention to certain elements among the passengers

236
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,999
Who favored the installation of lifeboats on the ship

237
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:49,375
Although we share their concern will remain unaltered Lee opposed to any consideration

238
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
Other course of action for the following reasons

239
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
The letter gets increasingly sarcastic

240
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,799
It demonstrates a lack of faith in our cap

241
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:02,431
Your parents security which lifeboats offer will make our Navigators Reckless

242
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,527
These proposals will distract our attention from more important things

243
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
IE building Unsinkable ships

244
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,415
You will only be safe for a worse fate inevitable death

245
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
On the Open Seas

246
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
So far from song

247
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,559
I think in the school letter you can see

248
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
Some of the issues

249
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
Are being debated

250
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,751
Like what kind of world will you emerge to if you survive a nuclear war

251
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:31,359
And whether the shelter system could somehow make our leaders more likely to engage in war

252
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
It's a very complicated calculus

253
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
This whole issue

254
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Weather today

255
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
Build a shelter or not

256
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
For the town of Artesia

257
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
In the early 1960s

258
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
The calculation seems easy enough

259
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,743
They needed a new school anyway

260
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,791
The office of civil defense

261
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
Agreed to pay the difference

262
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,143
Between building a regular school and a fallout shelter

263
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
Artesia was near Walker Air Force Base

264
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,823
Is closed now but at the time it was the largest Strategic Air Command base of the u.s. Air Force

265
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,895
It was also close to the White Sands Missile Range

266
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
These and other factors

267
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,759
Made Artesia feel particularly vulnerable to attack

268
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,111
New Mexico has always had nuclear programs going on

269
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,511
That's John Williams her friend's mom is one of the people that heard me on the radio and got in touch John Wick

270
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:25,631
When Dabo Elementary in the 1960s when cold war tensions were still really high

271
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
I do remember them

272
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
Going through

273
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
White Sands Missile Range

274
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,823
Every once in awhile you see a missile going up here thinking well

275
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,895
How often do we have 30 minutes to live or what

276
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,711
It's kind of a creepy feeling

277
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,295
Lakeside and Scott gave me the tour of ABO

278
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
Johnny didn't know it first why her

279
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
School with underground

280
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,207
The teachers never mentioned it and her parents and tell her either

281
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
They didn't tell us anything

282
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
And don't ask real questions

283
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
Will lie to you

284
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,959
But most kids have that one friend in elementary school that knows about sex

285
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
Well Jonah had fidelia Brennan

286
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,079
And she knew about nuclear war

287
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
Adelia Brannen

288
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
I'll never forget

289
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,735
She's the one who opened my eyes to that kind of

290
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,319
I guess reality or unreality

291
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
She was

292
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
Very intelligent

293
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,999
Course I had a fallout shelter in their backyard so I'm sure they had already gone through the whole survivalist thing

294
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Growing up and

295
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,375
You know knowing the kids and her family it seems like they were taught things like

296
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
How you could survive

297
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
Nuclear Holocaust in

298
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
I know I had kind of a freaky

299
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,055
Feeling about that after that

300
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,383
Like oh my gosh we're all going to die

301
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
Oh there you go

302
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,551
As Donna and I are talking an alarm starts going off

303
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:53,183
It's an emergency test alarm that the oil refinery plays every Monday at 6:30 p.m.

304
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:59,327
Artesia is a large oil refinery with another thing that made them feel vulnerable to attack in the 60s

305
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:04,447
Refineries are often targets during Wars especially the ones that make that people like the one in Artesia.

306
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,263
It's almost like a nuclear raid sound isn't it

307
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,591
What song is I Love Lucy was coming on when I was a kid

308
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,247
When Ava was built at got a fair amount of media attention

309
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,087
Dan Rather did a story on the CBS Evening News in nineteen

310
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,671
52 and more than 60,000 people tour the school in the

311
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
Its first few years

312
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,511
The Soviets found out about it and we're critical

313
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,583
One Moscow newspaper criticized artesians for

314
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
Indoctrinating pupils

315
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
To be inevitability of War

316
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,775
But actually while the rest of the country students were doing Duck and Cover drills

317
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
Probably strange

318
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Scary for

319
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Some kids

320
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,431
Johnny doesn't ever remember having to do one at a bow

321
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,807
But we never did any

322
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
You know

323
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,671
Like nuclear raid test where you had to drop tuck and roll and all that kind of stuff

324
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,975
We were already down there we were sick

325
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
So

326
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:05,119
Be sure to remember what Bert the turtle just Advance because everyone of us

327
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
Remember to do the same thing

328
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
That's what this feeling is all about

329
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
Duck and Cover

330
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,799
This is an official symbol.

331
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,407
Officials in the Soviet Union were putting down to us

332
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
For their preoccupation

333
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
Occupation with the

334
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
But in fact

335
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,343
The Soviets built a very elaborate

336
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
Secret shelter underneath

337
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Moscow

338
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,815
And of course our fearless leaders had their own hiding place has the most elaborate one being the bunker hidden below the Greenbrier

339
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
Maya Resort in West Virginia

340
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:40,447
Build the house all 535 members of Congress and their staff

341
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
But not

342
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
Their family

343
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,823
It was decommissioned in 1995 and is now open for tours

344
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:52,735
Remember the speech that we heard at the beginning of the story and which Kennedy vowed to allocate millions of dollars to find place

345
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,319
Places where Americans could take shelter from nuclear bombs

346
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,135
Well it took place in July 19th

347
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
61

348
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
Do identify and Marsh faces

349
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Construction

350
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Republican primary

351
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,167
In the fall of 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis

352
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,799
Kennedy asked for a status report and found that his shelter program was far behind schedule

353
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:23,455
The government hadn't been able to find all that many places where people could take shelter and the ones they had found weren't fully stocked

354
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Winsupply

355
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
By 1962 the

356
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
Private shelter

357
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
Ice was also

358
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:35,231
But it wasn't in decline because American stopped being afraid of nuclear war the Cuban Missile Crisis was arguably

359
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,791
The most frightening moment of the Cold War

360
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,119
Kenneth Rose thinks Americans rejected shelters

361
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
Score a lot of Ra

362
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
They couldn't afford them

363
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,031
Cost of a decent shelter it was about $2,500

364
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:54,687
That was about half of the median family income in the 1960s and doctor is also believes

365
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
Americans simply did not like

366
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
DND image of them

367
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Cells

368
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
Cowering Underground

369
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
I think

370
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Yet

371
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
Dog at American

372
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
Pride

373
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,231
We think roughly

374
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
Something like

375
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
200000 shelters

376
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
Is were built

377
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
From the beginning of the Cold War

378
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
To about 9

379
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
65

380
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
And

381
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
You could say that

382
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,799
Well 200,000 that's a lot of shelters

383
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
It's about 1

384
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
For every nine hundred

385
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
People

386
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
But

387
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,967
In an era when a majority of Americans

388
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
Actually believe

389
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,063
That there was going to be a nuclear war between the

390
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
The US

391
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,647
And the Soviet Union I would say that 200000

392
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
His ass is actually a

393
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Small number

394
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
Highway

395
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
Not go

396
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,607
Down under the ground

397
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,727
Does Summer come in round

398
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,359
Not carry myself down to die

399
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,623
Let me die in my footsteps

400
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:22,751
And as far as a bow Elementary if thankfully never had to serve as a fallout shelter and they got rid of their supply back

401
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,567
I can 1989p rid of all the bedding in the food

402
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
The medicine

403
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
UNIF you body bag

404
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,199
But the school stayed open until 1995

405
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:36,319
When they stop using it as a school it wasn't because they were tired of being Underground

406
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,623
Here's assistant superintendent

407
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
That's it

408
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
It is a little low

409
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,719
It is a little sad after grown

410
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Throwing up in the school

411
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
To see you

412
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,327
To see it not being used her to see it in this type of

413
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
A shape butt

414
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
We understand as a as a district ID

415
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
To renovate

416
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,543
This type of building was was more than

417
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,175
And what the community was willing to to put into it so we built a brand new school right on almost on top of it

418
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
It's still slightly to the West

419
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:09,599
The new school is called yeso Elementary yeso in a bow are both named after geological layers of Earth

420
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,159
Yeso being the layer just above a bow

421
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
Clever

422
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
Yeso is above ground

423
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,535
But in the spirit of ABO Elementary has

424
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
Very few windows

425
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
Now I bow Elementary is used

426
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
4 districts

427
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
Storage

428
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,703
Oh and one other

429
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
Being used as a Act

430
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
Shooter training facility

431
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,079
Before the federal Armed Force

432
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Training Center

433
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,407
They go through all of their scenarios in and use it

434
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Practice for

435
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,759
For situations that none of us want to think what happened but

436
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
What do you mean

437
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,623
Text school shootings that to you know been around the nation

438
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
This has been a

439
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,535
I really good facility to use cuz it's all downstairs no windows and they can do everything that they need to do and nobody

440
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
Nobody sees

441
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:55,423
The twice-a-month the federal law enforcement training center goes into a bow and practices

442
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,703
School shooting

443
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Running drills

444
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,519
Firing at Big targets

445
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,799
Something ever happens

446
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
You want to be prepared

447
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,383
Don't think you can never be prepared enough but

448
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
In case something does happen

449
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,015
Because if there's one thing Artesia has

450
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
Always been good at

451
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
It's being prepared

452
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
And protecting its

453
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
From whatever dangers

Between the beats

458
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,280
Bongs and chatter of our devices

459
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,864
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

460
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:02,496
If I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

461
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:08,384
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remedy for all hearing that voice

462
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
Technology talk to us

463
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,224

473
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,384
Makes for a much more natural experience

474
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
