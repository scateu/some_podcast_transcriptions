48
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:25,920
21 Peter Jefferson used to work the BBC for about life time and a half

49
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,248
And that one thing I did that was to read the shipping forecast

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,064
Peter started working for the BBC back in the 60s

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,880
He was an announcer which man he read the news

52
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,952
But one day they handed him a very different sort of scrap

53
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,304
It was the shipping forecast

54
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,096
Never thought that one day I'd be reading it

55
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,168
And when I was faced with it and lived to tell me

56
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,728
How would you go about reading it I was there

57
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
So he just read this

58
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
Word for word

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,152
Originally I was reading was wondering to myself

60
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Hell is all this about

61
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
But he got through it

62
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,880
And from that day forward Peter Jefferson's job which he would keep for 40 years until he made a fateful

63
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
Steak

64
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440

Including attention all shipping a journey round the shipping forecast

72
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:40,928

Forecast

74
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
Coming back to be saying this but

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,144
I have my alarm set every morning to go up for 25 5 in time for that early morning shipping forecast

76
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,472

00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:02,944
The story of how Charlie's favorite radio program came to be begins in the 1850s

79
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,992
With a man named Fitzroy

80
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:10,112
It comes back to you Admiral Robert Fitzroy who was the captain of the beagle Charles Darwin ship

81
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:14,208
After a long tumultuous sometimes controversial career

82
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
It took him all over the world

83
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,839
Bob Fitzroy decided he wanted to find a solution to one of the most serious

84
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,399
Problems facing Sailors in the 19th century

85
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
The weather

86
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
By the mid-nineteenth century the amount of shipping around the world was absolutely phenomenal

87
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,919
Antique stones with blocks a and ships would be lost live

88
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Chicago

89
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,343
Around this time people were just beginning to understand the connection between air pressure and storms

90
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,695
And fish woke up really interested in this because of the potential applications

91
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
Maritime

92
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,071
Fitzroy was appointed head of the new meteorological office

93
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,399
And he poured all his energy into the study of airbrush

94
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
Get a barometer

95
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
And he would use it to try to figure out

96
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775
What the weather was about to do

97
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
And then one day

98
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
In 1859

99
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,199
A ship called the Royal Charter was sailing from Australia to Liverpool

100
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,271
Many of the passengers onboard were minors

101
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,831
Returning from the Australian goldfields

102
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
They were almost home

103
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
When suddenly

104
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,255
Huge storm blew up in in the RCN chase the ship out of the coast

105
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,631
Robert Fitzroy was sitting in his house in London at the time of Jesus

106
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,959
On the wall

107
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,263
So I knew that was a big storm somewhere

108
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,079
In the vicinity of Britain and Ireland

109
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,919
The captain of the royal Charter try to ride out the storm

110
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,503
But eventually the winds blew the ship onto the rocks

111
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
The Royal Charter song

112
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,367
And over 450 people drowned

113
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:53,023
Throw Fitzroy to this really badly because I felt responsible for this terrible disaster

114
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
They can want anyone

115
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,399
Fitzroy decided to devote the rest of his life to saving lives at sea

116
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
By predicting the weather

117
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:06,335
Which in Victorian times was pretty controversial because here they are they're very religious people and anything that kind of sounded a bit like

118
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,431
Prophecy was kind of heavy dragons in witchcraft as far as the victorians

119
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Concerned

120
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,247
So we decided to use a synonym

121
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
4 prophecy

122
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,087
That didn't sound quite so Twitchy

123
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,207
He invented invented the term weather forecast to distinguish it from prophesying

124
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
Superstition in electronic thing

125
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
Fitzroy inventor of the weather forecast

126
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,911
Delivered his prognostications by Telegraph to the various ports around the UK

127
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,263
Signal flags were hoisted in the harbor to warn ships heading out to sea

128
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,079
Eventually his forecast for published in the newspaper

129
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,407
And well they were often ridiculed by readers at the time

130
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
They were pretty accurate

131
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
And they became indispensable

132
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:51,135
We're Sailors and fishermen alive that was saved as a result of Fitzroy anyway

133
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
And decades after his death

134
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
Fitzroy shipping forecast would expand its reach

135
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,607
And become a British spoken word love poem to the Sea

136
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,167
All thanks to a new technology

137
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
Radio the BBC

138
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,079
British Broadcasting Company calling

139
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:15,711
BBC was founded in 1922

140
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
And 2 years later

141
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,087
The first shipping forecast went out on the airwaves BBC Radio full

142
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:26,719
Map shipping forecast there have been many shipping forecast readers over the years

143
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:33,119
Biking Nova Terrace Southwest Southeast becoming cyclonic 5 to 7

144

145
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,007
1969 Peter Jefferson join the club

146
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,847
When he first started he didn't understand the words he was reading

147
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
He was not a sailor

148
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
In fact he couldn't even swim

149
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
He didn't know the difference between a gale

150
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,063
In a cyclone he didn't know exactly where docker was

151
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,719
What time does the yolk White actress that said this is what it means

152
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
Peter learned that the numbers are wind speed

153
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
The directions are wind direction

154
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,631
In the random adjectives like good

155
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,655
Or poor

156
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,703
Are descriptions of the visibility

157
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,775
And all those Whimsical names are real places

158
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,335
Regions of the ocean around Great Britain

159
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
Names by the Met off

160
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,919
Some are named after Islands

161
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
Or towns along the coast

162
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
Summer named after Rivers

163
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,551
Summer named off to sandbanks

164
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,855
Was wonderful Rockwall

165
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
Which mm

166
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,439
Mitchell is a rock sticking out of the sea

167
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,999
Inhabited by seagulls nothing else I think

168
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:38,655
Sailors know how to decode the shipping forecast in over the years it has provided them with wheelie important information

169
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
But most people in Great Britain

170
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
Are landlubbers

171
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,311
They do not need to know the weather conditions around some seagull rock

172
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
Hundreds of miles from the nearest coastline

173
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Still

174
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
There's just something

175
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
About the forecast

176
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
That appeals to them

177
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,367
The words and the I suppose the tone and the

178
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Pace

179
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,927
Mesmerizing in a way

180
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,511
People just drive is everything from just very soothing to a sort of

181
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Prayer

182
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,375
And maybe you can see where this is heading

183
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,679
Maybe as you listen to Peter

184
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
Your eyelids

185
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
Are getting heavy

186
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
And your thoughts

187
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Are getting dreamy

188
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
If this is the case

189
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
You Are Not Alone

190
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,943
Peter discovered pretty early on

191
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,247
The people all across Great Britain

192
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,063
For tuning into the late-night shipping forecast

193
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
Just before 1 in the morning

194
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
Or something

195
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
Entirely different

196
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
From its intended purpose

197
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
Somebody once said to me

198
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,351
I love listening to you sending me asleep

199
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Beijing Nights

200
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,447
Peter was loving them into sweet

201
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
Sweets

202
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
Oblivion

203
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,799
I took it to the backhanded compliment ready anyway

204
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
For the record

205
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
I hear this a lot to

206
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
You've told me that my voice puts you to sleep

207
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
It doesn't bother me

208
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,575
I'm sure you wake up in the morning and listen to every episode from the beginning

209
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Really appreciate the craftsmanship

210
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,439
The quality journalism

211
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:11,071
Cut oneself off from the actual meaning it doesn't actually have that that time have a meaning to you

212
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,887
Dentist Chester American Voice

213
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
Speaking to you

214
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
Soothing way

215
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,455
On YouTube someone strong dozens of shipping forecast together into a 5 hour video

216
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
In the comments

217
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:34,111
Are all these people going on and on about how much the shipping forecast has helped

218
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Cure their insomnia

219
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,207
I fell asleep to this almost every night

220
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
There's something oddly soothing about it

221
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,351
Yep bores the pants off me to sleep as well

222
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Beyond

223
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,679
There's dozens of these comments

224
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Love this

225
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
So boring

226
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,823
Bedtime story zzzzzzzz

227
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:01,503
And honestly providing a soothing bedtime story might be the forecast primary function at this point

228
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575
Plenty of people still listen out at sea

229
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
But these days

230
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,975
Many sailors have weather radar on board and smartphones with internet access

231
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,279
I'm surprised actually that it still there

232
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:18,143
Because there are many other ways of getting that information rather than listening to the radio

233
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
And yet decade after decade

234
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,519
The BBC continues to broadcast the forecast

235
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
Every single day

236
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
The exact same times

237
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:33,503
Some music I know they change the time the shipping forecast spend thousands of people marching on Brookhurst

238
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
London

239
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,599
This might be a bit of an exaggeration

240
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,671
But the point is the British Bob the shipping forecast

241
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,719
And you shouldn't try to take it away from them

242
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,791
The goodness knows what might happen to be civil wars

243
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,983
Over his decades-long career

244
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,079
Peter Jefferson became one of the most recognizable readers of the shipping forecast

245
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,127
And his voice was a metronome

246
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,175
Sailors and insomniacs alike

247
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,015
Peter had all kinds of other responsibilities at the BBC

248
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,343
But you could never really Escape his association with the forecast

249
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,135
Not even at his own wedding

250
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,279
Am I then future wife and myself while I was outside the church we had these bank at Fords have lost again on inside

251
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,839
Fully went in on

252
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:25,727
The vicar was in there delivering what he called their wedding forecast in which he described their partnership as

253
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Moderate

254
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
Becoming good

255
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
Which coast

256
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,407
A great deal of love laughter and when we had it before it was fantastic

257
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,503
And then one day after learning some bad news

258
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
Peter made a mistake

259
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Aaliyah that died being told

260
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
A prostate cancer end

261
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,719
I don't think I should have gone into work that day cuz my mind was

262
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:51,071
Note on what I was actually doing it was on other things that you can put the Imagine

263
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,631
He stumbled over his words trying to transition

264
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
I thought I chose the mic

265
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
But I haven't found I said

266
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
Unfortunately

267
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
I followed it shortly afterwards

268
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
Peter was fired

269
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,879
I got a phone call from my boss and the shift of the next few weeks but after that

270
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Thank you and goodbye

271
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,535
The BBC has consistently maintained they didn't fire Peter because of the slip

272
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,887
Camping around for a long time and they wanted to get some fresh faces in the building

273
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,215
Enough I mean I was thinking of stopping at a few months later anyway

274
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
Forecast Moscow on though

275
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Panda.

276
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,687
The shipping forecast guy outfit on the real thing it is terrifically important

277
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,991
Insanity warning paper-bag weather

278
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,831
I'm just reminding people that we are Marathon people wear Marathon nice

279
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
This is Charlie Connolly again

280
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,207
He talks about the shipping forecast like it's a piece of literature

281
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,279
An Ode to Great Britain's relationship with the sea

282
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:59,679
National effects like the Canterbury Tales and Beowulf for the shipping forecast to be the equivalent

283
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,983
British national anthem

284
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,775
National Epic

285
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,335
We knew chapters written everyday

286
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,871
Four times a day

287
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,199
Buy bunch of meteorologist in office block somewhere

288
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Buddy

289
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
Guy sitting at desk

290
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,111
Waste Paper bins next to make Browning apple cores in them

291
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:23,743
Then and it was texting them saying what somebody be human and then they producing this amazing stuff

292
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
Gyros

293
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Every one of them

294
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,887
As for our hero

295
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
Peter Jefferson

296
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,239
Getting fired did not sever his connection with the shipping forecast

297
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
If anything

298
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
It made it stronger

299
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,103
It gave him time to write an entire book about

300
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
And he's got a new project

301
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
Lexus lost yeah right I go to an email out of the blue the email was from the popular meditation app

302
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
Calm

303
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
Comb produces what they call Sleep story

304
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
Meant to be listen to right before bed

305
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,767
And they wanted Peter to read the shipping forecast for them

306
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
Minnesota Twins

307
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,119
Imeca rather soothing bedtime story

308
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Peter obliged

309
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,727
He read the forecast from his last day at the BBC

310
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,775
It was a pretty quiet day weather wise

311
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
No major storms

312
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:15,711
Much more slowly than I would normally

313
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
Successful

314
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,575
So successful that they hired him to read another of their bedtime stories

315
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,391
And this one has nothing to do with the shipping forecast

316
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,463
What they want me to do is read this very

317
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
Retarded

318
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
Legalese

319
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
Documents

320
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,911
Facebook send people to sleep and I think they're absolutely right

321
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,287
Here's a little taste of Peter reading from the eu's recent General data protection regulation

322
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,895
How many codons to the Treaty of the functioning of the European Union

323
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
Particular

324
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,015
Article 16 lateral it's pretty sinilangan stuff

325
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
Having regards to the proposal

326
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
European Commission

327
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,927

Economics

329
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
He may not be saving lives at sea

330
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,607
But Peter believes helping people get to sleep

331
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,911
Is a very honorable profession

332
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,007
As somebody who has huge problems

333
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
Fall asleep self

334
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
I hope that it does work

335
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,895
Cuz I know what horrible thing it is if you

336
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
Come get to sleep

00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,391

Stay tuned for more of the art of putting people to sleep with sound

00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
If

364
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,871
I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,879
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

369
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,463
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

370
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,511
To make them more human

371
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
Turn the living room lights on

372
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Okay

373
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
Dim the living room lights to 50

374
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
2%

375
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Okay

376
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,151
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

377
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,967
Makes for a much more natural experience

378
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,015
Turn the living room lights on

379
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
Dim the living room lights

380
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,111
50%

381
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:41,535
Representing two special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

382
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,351
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

383
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

384
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:52,031
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th right here on the 9th 9 p.m.

385
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,383
We need to talk about something

386
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,711
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

387
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:05,599
It's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating

388
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:10,975
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

389
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:17,375
You don't know why and it may be time to seek help go to oh my God. Info / podcast

390
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:22,751
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

391
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Oh my God

392
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
Flask podcast

393
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,175
Okay so the shipping forecast became a bedtime ritual for a lot of people

394
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Accidentally

395
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
In the same could be said of our show

396
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:38,623
About this week's episode might be a bit of an exception most of the time we're not trying to put you to sleep

397
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,207
But I'm here with you Ackerman who is the creator of a podcast called sleep with me

398
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
And the whole goal of his show

399
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
Does that help people doze off

400
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,887
ESO sleeping me is a bedtime story podcast for grown up

401
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,191
And the whole idea is

402
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,263
To take the listener's mind off of what's keeping them away

403
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
Wake

404
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:01,151
To disengage them enough so they can pay attention to the story or to what I'm saying

405
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,735
But where they don't feel the pressure to keep listening

406
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
And there's also the risk of like

407
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,087
Is this compelling thing coming at my show

408
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,695
A steer right around the compelling farts and I go into the Indian details

409
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,999
Is my cat a specialty

410
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
But

411
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,863
It is it's just like a bedside companion

412
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
That's meant to be there

413
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:27,007
In the my grip on The Listener ideal he's just loose enough that they feel like they could just let

414
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,591
Go my hand and drift away when they want to

415
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
I think that if you were to

416
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:37,247
Look up what a relaxation videos on YouTube there's a

417
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,879
Harp music or a whooshing sounds or people whispering or something

418
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,975
This appeals to the swerve the intellectual monkey mind

419
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
That is

420
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:53,119
Tripping wait you at your day and you create something enough of a narrative that people can latch onto

421
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
But it's loose enough

422
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,471
That people can also drift away from

423
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,311
And how did you come up with this as the way

424
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
2

425
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,407
To be that type of bedtime companion

426
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:12,575
Hellboy I have this controversial belief that I didn't want to bring up on the podcast but I call that kind of part of our brain

427
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
Brain brain.

428
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
Should I believe it

429
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,952
Then my brain and maybe other people's brains are populated by these little

430
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Droid

431
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
In all these Droids that they serve these different

432
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,584
Purposes like at worrying

433
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
Thinking about the past

434
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,472
And none of them have sleep modes unfortunately

435
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,776
And I found said that

436
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:36,640
By just going to say hey come on over here let me tell you a story I hear to see your worrying about high school

437
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:40,992
And then when you spill. Lemonade down your shirt yet who I love I'm going to talk about it

438
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,064
A suspenders for a little while and Rainbow Stew

439
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
Suspenders in particular

440
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
And ideas

441
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,464
Even one party has to be like what is it I can picture rainbows

442
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
Suspenders

443
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
I've never had them but

444
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,888
And I do it's like so they could that suggest visual enough and just enjoy it enough

445
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,728
That you'll think about it for a few minutes and interrupt your train of thought

446
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,264
We're going to be like

447
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:08,128
Okay he's it's been 14 minutes he's still talking about rainbow suspenders

448
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,432
Lakers

449
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,272
Used trying to conceive try to make a metaphor about it

450
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,624
What's somewhere under the rainbow suspender

451
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
So they gay

452
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,000
And what we do here to question that just came up while I was recording this interview

453
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,864
Are there any leprechauns that have rainbow suspenders cuz they should

454
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,936
I really wanted to white people

455
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,776
Or make them feel some kind of delight versus bedtime that you feel so

456
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Serious

457
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
An ominous

458
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
Even if I don't

459
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
Hit that goal

460
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
It's like

461
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:47,296
I joke I might not make you smile but maybe I can bring your face to a neutral

462
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:51,136
Two neutral level

463
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,696
It's like my over trying to overshoot

464
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744
I can just get to the place where the people

465
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Instead of laughing

466
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
Define

467
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,888
Oh yeah that's pretty good

468
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:07,776
Drew's approach the storytelling is quite unique but over the years he has tried to fall asleep to

469
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
Lots of different types of audio

470
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
When he was growing up

471
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:16,224
There was this comedy radio show called Doctor Demento and he like to listen to it late at night

472
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
Helping get to sleep

473
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,576
So when I was a kid and I had trouble sleeping

474
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:27,232
Remember I was telling this one classmate like I can't sleep at night and then Sunday nights are the worst because they started having anxiety about

475
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,280
School ever been at school a few days

476
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:34,656
And he said my other my older brother listen to this radio show is on Sunday nights from 9 to 11

477
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,472
It's a comedy radio show they play parody songs

478
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,104
And I turned into it and I guess one of the things I wanted in the in the Doctor Demento provided

479
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:48,736
Like this can be like an overused word or sound over-ambitious but like

480
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,040
It really is this idea of compassion

481
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:57,440
When you break up the word like is suffering with or suffering together and I'll dig documentary knew that but it was like dr.

482
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720
They are with me

483
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,512
Sitting by my bedside scene

484
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,328
Hey the skunk stinks you can't sleep and

485
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
I really feel bad

486
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
For you

487
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
And

488
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:11,776
When I can't sleep I have this story about myself running through my brain about the past about the future

489
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:15,872
And I want to just misdirect people and say Hey listen to the story over here

490
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,688
It's a it's a nicer story you're not a character in it

491
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:25,600
And it's just here to keep you company in here sitting you don't even need to listen to it to fall asleep at like I'll just be here to tell you

492
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,624
Play the story

493
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
End

494
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,464
Pegasus of what I wanted as a kid 2

495
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:36,096
Haven't you been doing sleep with me for a few years what kind of feedback have you gotten from the listeners of the show

496
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
So

497
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,704
It was in the first leg a 8 months of the show

498
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,848
Occasionally the end that would make jokes like a and I think it was because I was new to podcasting in May

499
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,480
It was really afraid I would make you do that self-effacing jokes like oh no one's probably listening to this

500
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,528
At this point in the show

501
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,088
I got three emails in a row from people

502
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,392
Please don't say that like

503
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
I am awake

504
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
At the end of the show

505
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
And I'm listening to the show

506
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,328
To be distracted like because I'm not going to fall asleep

507
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,144
And it's painful for me to be reminded of that

508
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,472
And it brought me right back to that memory is like lying there

509
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,056
When I went to the doctor men told there was no hope of me falling asleep either

510
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,872
So that was one piece of feedback is that

511
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:24,224
It's pretty powerful and then it's like just getting feedback about what people are afraid of

512
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
And then trying to steer around that

513
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
Leica

514
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,112
For spiders and be like web-based being sore

515
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,672
For any other animals that are scary like Forest

516
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
Friends lake

517
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,768
I like stuff like that like tried as just a dream

518
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:41,888
Drive the car right around those trees Savannah crash into him

519
