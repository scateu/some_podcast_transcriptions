This is 99% invisible

23
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,728
We begin with an unsolved murder mystery

25
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,288
Actually a series of unsolved murders

26
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,104
Perhaps the work of the United States

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
Worst serial killer

28
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,968
Before Jack the Ripper terrorize London

29
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,296
Before HH Holmes stock the Chicago World's Fair

30
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
Austin Texas

31
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,416
Was haunted by the servant girl annihilator

32
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:37,024
Producer Avery trufelman would like to reiterate that these murders are unsolved

33
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:41,632
So it's possible that these were individual murders rather than the work of one man

34
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
The hard fast

35
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
Fact is this

36
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,728
In 1885

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
8 Women

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
Mostly black servants

39
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
Brutally murdered

40
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,360
In the dark of night

41
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,152
And the night was very dark

42
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,200
In Austin in 1885

43
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
There was essentially no Street

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
The darkness

45
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
Just life

46
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
After sundown

47
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,184
In the 19th century it's something that modern

48
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
People are just completely

49
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
This is Bruce hunt

50
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:13,632
He's an associate professor of the history of physics and Technology at the University of Texas Austin

51
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,216
Basically there was no outdoor lighting there was moonlight

52
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,008
When the moon was out that was about

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,128
And in 1894 the City of Austin decided to buy more moonlight

54
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
In the form of towers

55
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
They're called Moonlight Towers

56
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
Because we were supposed to

57
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Full moon

58
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,320
Austin adopted Moonlight Towers

59
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,904
Was really work Powers there 15 stories high

60
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,560
Very industrial-looking made of metal scaffolding and each was crowned with a circle of six lights

61
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
Soaring way way high above the city

62
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
Austin wasn't the first to implement Tower lighting

63
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,032
In the eighteen-hundreds a lot of major cities had them

64
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:57,664
ArcLight hours illuminated streets in New York Baltimore La San Jose and Detroit

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Detroit had a very huge

66
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
Much larger than Austin

67
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,552
And that's actually where Austin got their moonlight

68
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Towers

69
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,368
In 1894 the city purchase

70
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
Just 31 of them

71
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
From the city of Detroit

72
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,720
And despite their romantic name

73
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
Be absurdly tall Moonlight Towers were actually a very practical design

74
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,448
And their height was meant to accommodate the lighting they use

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
There are clients there initially were ArcLight

76
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
Carbon Arc lights

77
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,336
The precursor to the incandescent bulb

78
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,152
Park lights are basically a continued Spark

79
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Between two carbon

80
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
They're extremely bright

81
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
Lot of glitter

82
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:40,928
And if you put Arc lights at street-level that's blinding will the solution that was to put it up High Enough

83
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,208
Food spread the light up

84
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
But even on their Hightower

85
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
Dark lights were still so bright

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,704
I mean they be bright by today's standards but then imagine what that would look like to you if you were an austinite in the 1890s

87
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
Accustomed to pitch black streets

88
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
And gas lamps

89
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,360
The Gaslamp has the power of about 15 kennel

90
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
An arc light has the power of a couple thousand

91
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,736
It was a very intense light almost two months flight

92
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,856
People would go out and enjoy the life that they would bring umbrellas in order to Shield themselves from the glare

93
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
This is Ernest freeberg

94
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,464
Head of the history department at the University of Tennessee Knoxville

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,768
He's also the author of the book the age of Edison

96
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,583
Electric light and the invention of modern America

97
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,727
In the glare was just one of the problems with our clients there were a few other downsides sounded like a

98
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
A swarm of angry

99
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
With Buzz

100
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
And they would

101
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
Child abuse azby's carbons burned

102
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
They were dropped

103
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,503
Shreds of Ash burning Ash down on people down below

104
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
There's a girl back

105
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:44,671
Even with their blinding glare and nefarious hum and deposits of molten ash

106
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
Carbon Arc lights were still so exciting

107
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,327
They created a whole new world for people accustomed to dim and Dark City

108
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:57,727
Because bright electric light can highlight certain things that you might not even notice in the full light of day

109
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
There's a lot of great discussion about

110
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,335
Seeing the grass in a totally different way

111
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
People love to look at their hands under the ArcLight in

112
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
In the dark

113
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
They were seeing

114
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
The details of their hands and

115
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
In new ways

116
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
They heard

117
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
It was really up for a change in perception

118
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,391
What's up

119
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,719
The thrilling feeling of being out at night and feeling safe

120
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,023
Because disability equal safety

121
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,887
Some cities that these newfangled streetlights are going to cut back on the need for police

122
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,215
Or even eliminate law enforcement entirely

123
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,495
If you could set up a

124
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
An arc light in the middle of a

125
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,151
Town Square you charge for be returning the square to the public and take it away from criminals and

126
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,735
Mary Wells were hanging around in the shadows by driving out the shadow

127
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:46,367
People called The Arc lights policemen on a pole and they allow for a whole new kind of life

128
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,415
Many people were very excited to go out and

129
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,231
Attend a fancy ball under the arcway

130
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,279
Once they got there they realized

131
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Set this

132
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
Spark blue light

133
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
Highlighted every one of their

134
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
Imperfections so every gray hair and wrinkles

135
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,007
Many people felt that they would never again go near

136
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Electric light

137
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:08,895
Vanity aside everyone was kind of nervous about the general idea of light at night

138
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
It was unnatural they decreed the towers could cause sleeplessness cast Erie Shadows crops would overproduce

139
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
Hinswood overlay

140
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,927
There were stories at the ArcLight slurred Restless alligators to the shore

141
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,743
And attracting biblical proportions of crickets

142
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,559
According to the Austin Statesman in 1921

143
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,919
Bruce hunt suspects of these reports were overblown

144
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
Journalism was so much fun back then

145
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,415
But the biggest problem with the towers was that their height made them a drag to maintain the arcs

146
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,975
Burn down the carbon electrodes very rapidly

147
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:00,095
So you had to go up and change them about once a day and I cannot emphasize enough how

148
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,887
Super-tall these things are

149
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,191
How tall is a 15-story building

150
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,007
If you look at one of Austin's Moonlight Towers

151
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,847
There's a rickety little pulley type thing in the center of it

152
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
Like a dumbwaiter apparatus

153
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Supposedly there

154
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Guy would stand on Madden

155
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
Pulling self up

156
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,551
To go up and change the carbon electrodes everyday

157
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
That's a nuisance

158
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Panda Express

159
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
And so

160
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
As soon as

161
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,767
They could really by the 1920s the city replaced it

162
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Arclights the carbon Arc

163
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
With

164
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,119
Big incandescent bulbs

165
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
Which were not as bright

166
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
But we're a lot

167
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,079
But while Austin was fussing around with different bulbs

168
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,919
Most other cities had already removed their tower lights completely

169
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
Every place else abandoned

170
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
Please put Austin kept them

171
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,855
Awesome had fallen on Hard Times in the city couldn't afford to tear down the towers

172
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
And so they just stayed

173
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,743
And to this day 17 of the original 31 survive

174
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
The last

175
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
Of the Moonlight hours

176
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:08,191
Although today without the arc lights the Moonlight Towers have a kind of weak and distant low

177
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
They're easy to ignore

178
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,103
That you might know them from a little movie called Dazed and Confused

179
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,711
Dazed and Confused is set in Austin in 1976

180
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,575
In the movie A bunch of kids party and drive around until they all gather at the end

181
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
By my tower

182
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,183
There's a new fiesta in the making as we speak

183
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,279
Santa Moon Town in the movie Dazed and Confused Richard linklater movie

184
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Matthew McConaughey

185
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,399
Party at the Moontower but there Moonlight Towers

186
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,727
In real life people don't actually go there to party

187
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
Most of them are

188
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,311
Justin sort of like parking lots or something

189
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,455
I went to a Moonlight tower on the side of a busy road on the corner of 9th and Guadalupe

190
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:57,855
Guadalupe clearly I need a local to help my name is Wiley Wiggins I'm 38 years old I was born

191
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Torn racing

192
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Austin Texas

193
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:04,255
And in the early 90s I was in a movie by Richard linklater called Daisy

194
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,607
He played the Freshman Mitch Kramer who wanders about the moon Towers

195
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
What's it called the Moontower anyway

196
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,727
I guess they decided to

197
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,031
Put up out here whenever they were building the power plant

198
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
Actually it's a good idea I mean you got a full moon out here every day of the year you know and then they all climb up the moon tower

199
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
Places to be off-limits man

200
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Some drunk freshman

201
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Fell off

202
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,111
You went right down the middle smacking his head on every

203
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Beamer

204
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
I hear it doesn't hurt after

205
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
The first couple though

206
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:39,327
In real life these Moonlight hours would be really hard to climb which is my for this scene

207
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,399
Richard linklater made of fake Moonlight hour

208
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,959
The one in the movie had a ladder not the pulley thing

209
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,543
And it was nowhere near as tall as a real Moonlight Tower

210
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
And I'm terrified of heights

211
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,151
Wiley would have never tried this stunt

212
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:58,271
No one he knew actually did when I was a kid there was always somebody who knew somebody who knew

213
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:03,647
New somebody who would climb that it's unclear how many times this was ever attempted but in any case

214
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
Stories about

215
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,535
And it was a point when Austin considered finally taking these old lights down

216
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:14,399
Just like all the other cities have done fifties and sixties beatitude was Willy's are out of date

217
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Can I pull those down

218
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,031
In fact I've got a video that I found online that was a sort of

219
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Little

220
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,871
Historical vignettes of Austin that was made by one of those

221
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
What TV station

222
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
60

223
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Tonight

224
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
Progress report Austin

225
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
The legends of Austin

226
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
And is it

227
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,879
Here's the Moonlight Towers in Here Today Show

228
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
Romance of these Moonlight Towers

229
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Disappeared

230
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Ears

231
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
29 of these towers left

232
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
800

233
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
50 feet high

234
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
Mercury vapor lamps of 9000 Campbell

235
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,447
No power now they're out of date now and no doubt will soon disappear

236
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
Modern times

237
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
New improvements in life

238
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
How many days

239
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
Inefficient for

240
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
Providing light

241
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
And it's a shame

242
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
For anyone who has walked

243
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
They're going to party

244
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
Watching the Shadows

245
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Lowe's Dubuque

246
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,391
And there's a sort of tone that that's well as little remnant of our past that we will lose soon

247
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
What people just said why should we

248
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Keep them up

249
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,071
Two Towers were inducted into the National Registry of historic places

250
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
1976

251
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
Some of the towers even have plaques

252
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
And Austin power provider Austin Energy

253
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,799
What has a lot of resources into maintaining the towers

254
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,127
Take it from Austin Energy spokesman Carlos Cordova

255
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
Right now it's really in

256
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
Christine about the moon

257
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,735
Mike Towers is there going to be going through a renovation

258
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,295
In this renovation is a total drag

259
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,879
Because these towers are in the National Registry of historic places

260
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
They have to be restored

261
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,535
To the original form so we can go to Home Depot or Lowe's and buy bolts and

262
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
The contractor has to

263
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Cast bolts

264
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
Parts that look

265
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Exactly I did

266
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
So you can keep it

267
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,335
That's what I love about these Moonlight Towers man

268
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
I get older

269
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
They stay the same age

270
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:10,879
Have an expensive project it's very specialized word that of course affect the price

271
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:16,255
But notice there wasn't any uproar for the citizens about spending this money on the Moonlight hours

272
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
Austinites

273
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Are willing to put up the funds

274
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
Towers artist point of civic pride

275
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,007
Every year during the holidays Austin Energy strings Christmas lights from the Moonlight Tower and Zilker Park

276
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,591
And austinites lovingly refer to that Tower as the Zilker Park

277
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Tree

278
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:37,759
Austin also host the Moontower Comedy Festival and there's a local band called Moonlight powers and at a restaurant I ordered

279
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
Drink called a Moonlight Tower

280
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:44,927
The towers have become part of the character in folklore of Austin I mean there's all sorts of

281
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
Some stuff about them

282
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,303
Like when I was a kid. Of course there was always a legend that somebody had climbed up on acid and falling off

283
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
Which is definitely not true

284
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
But then of course

285
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,935
The other Legend is that they were built

286
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
Because of there was a

287
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
Serial killer

288
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
Like a in the

289
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
For like the 1800s

290
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,175
And that one I think is supposed to be true right have we have we verified

291
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,295
The servant-girl annihilator story is not a myth that all that is absolutely true

292
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
It has nothing to do with the Moon

293
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
At least not directly

294
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
That was all over with

295
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
Welder

296
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Before the cock

297
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
But I've never seen any

298
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
I need four

299
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,543
Still the servant-girl annihilator became that awesome expel about these lines

300
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,943
And the story of the servant-girl annihilator does truly illustrate the limitations of nineteenth-century

301
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Nighttime

302
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,039
Is carbon Arc Street lamps were chasing away Darkness

303
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
Sphere

304
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
And I think it's something we

305
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
So easily take for granted

306
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
Liberating

307
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,975
This is how much the darkness

308
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
Was a permanent

309
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
Form of limitation on

310
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,351
Freewheel one human activity

311
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,655
EBenefits

312
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
It's of course said that that we sometimes Miss

313
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
Because we have too much right now

314
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,311
Moonlight Towers were strange offshoot

315
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,639
Sort of Neanderthal in the evolution of the street light

316
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:13,759
And in Austin where Keep Austin Weird is an unofficial slogan of the city

317
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,087
Printed on bumper stickers and sprawled on bathroom walls

318
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,183
You can't help it feel like the moon towers are doing their part

319
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,511
After every other city has torn their towers down

320
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
Boston holds on to theirs

321
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
And preserves them

322
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,959
A reminder of the time when the Texas Capitol was Dustin Oddball little town

323
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
That bought the Moon

324
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
Those who have

325
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
Look closely

326
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Look closely

327
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
The day of the artificial Moon

328
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
Yes I will one day this

329
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
The last and Foundation

330
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
The Moonlight glow

331

Dutchtown

Beautiful Downtown Oakland California

335
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,943
Special thanks to Josephine Hill and Mark Oppenheimer for help on this episode

336
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
Between the beats

337
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,855
Bongs and chatter of our devices

338
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,439
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

339
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
If

340
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,863
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

341
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,959
All hearing. Voice

342
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Technology

343
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
She talked to us

344
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
It is a creation of Sonic trash

345
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,871
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

346
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,455
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

347
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
To make them more human

348
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,343
Turn the living room lights on

349
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Okay

350
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
Dim the living room lights to 50

351
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
2%

352
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Okay

353
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:05,887
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

354
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
Makes for a much more natural

355
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
Experience

356
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
Turn the living room lights on

357
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
Dim the living room lights

358
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
50%

359
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,431
We're presenting to

360
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,527
Special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

361
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,343
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

362
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,903
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

363
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,719
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

364
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
