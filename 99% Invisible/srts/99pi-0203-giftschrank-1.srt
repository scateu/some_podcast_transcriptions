There was one thing the Americans and the British and the French and the Russians

42
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,080
All wanted out of Germany

43
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,360
It was a book

Mine comp or my struggle was Adolf Hitler's fictionalized autobiography outlines his political

00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,320
Audiology in plans for Germany's future

46
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,904
It's a synthesis of his hatred for Jews and other groups

47
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
It was everywhere

48
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712

00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,136

Mind Kampf

64
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,304
Mein kampf was given out to people when they join the Nazi party

65
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,840
And in some cities

66
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,400
The government would even give it as a wedding gift

67
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448
If I copy to a fresh married

68
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:55,872
As we do to a close a lot of Germans threw away or burn their copies of mine comp

69
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,200
No one wanted to look like a Nazi to the occupying Army

70
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
Still

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,784
The Allies felt the need to ban the book

72
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,856
Especially the Americans

73
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,880
Military government

74
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,720
Maiden law in 445

75
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,304
Which Nazi party itself and

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
And also

77
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
This law Bans

78
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
A mine comp no mine comp was only banned outright for a few years after all the Third Reich had been infamous

79
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,568
For censorship and banning books

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,920
In the last thing the new German Republic wanted was to look like Nazis

81
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,968
Hitler's intellectual property

82
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Including mine

83
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
Was ultimately given to the government

84
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,392
The state in southern Germany where Hitler Rose to power

85
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,232
And the Bavarian government decided that as the copyright owners

86
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,328
They would not publish any new German editions of Mein Kampf

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,168
And it would seek to limit and control who had access to the book

88
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,240
That way they could make sure it was used only for scholarship

89
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
And Nas in an attempt

90
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
To revive

91
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Fascism

92
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
And it just so happened that Germany had the perfect tool for the job

93
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:10,112
Something to help them deal with sensitive information that's neither censorship nor

94
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
Open access

95
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696

The few different

111
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,623
In a pharmacy it's a place for keeping controlled substance

112
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
But one of the oldest usages

00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Going back

These materials were set aside not so much to protect them from people

120
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,287
Protect people from them

121
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,103

Of the Bavarian State Library

140
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
This Story begins

141
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:55,583
In this library at shortly after the foundation in 16th century

142
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,887
At this time in the 1580s

143
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,471
Vario was a kingdom inside of the Holy Roman Empire

144
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,031
Which didn't want the public reading works

145
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
They considered heretical

146
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:12,479
They put aside authors like Martin Luther and Galileo even some Catholic office which will not

147
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Okay for the

148
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
Catholic Church

149
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,367
Well these anti-clerical writings may have been prohibited

150
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,439
The powers-that-be didn't just round up all the copies they can

00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
Find Burnham

152
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
They thought it would be good to hold on to them

153
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,863
You have better arguments if you know what the other side sings

154
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,703
At the order of the Duke of Bavaria the library took all the Forbidden literature

155
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,007
Put it in a lockbox and called it

157
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,127
The Box contained about 500 works

158
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Opposed by the

159
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
The Catholic Church

160
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
Which around only as a means of reference

161
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,783
It's for those working to oppose the people

162
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
Who opposed the church

163
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111

166
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
Overtime

167
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,815
The Catholic Church's grip over Europe got weaker

168
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:05,215
What is 18 hundreds to give shrunks of German libraries were less concerned with protecting us from the Protestant writings of

169
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Martin Luther

170
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,799
And more concerned with protecting us from sex

171
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,663
And this came to the fore when the king of Bavaria acquired a private collection of books

172
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,223
That had belonged to a guy named fun

173

00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
Repeating

181
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,383
People who like to be whipped and okay

182
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,503
Unwilling to throw these controversial books out and unwilling to make them readily available

183
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,111
Librarians found a home for Bond cleaners erotica collection in the gift Ron

184
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,975
And they were very serious about keeping its contents secure

185
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,511
There were two keys

186
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
And only if

187
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,351
They virtual care that they could open that

188
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
The gift wrap

189
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,703
It's like it like a nuclear launch

190
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,055
Yeah and some people believe that the books inside the gift wrong

191
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,335
We're so dangerous

192
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,383
They could literally make you sick

193
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,223
There was one librarian at the time who got crazy

194
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
Yusuf She-Ra

195
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,319
And he put mentally ill

196
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,903
And after he was in the hospital his friend

197
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
When trees room

198
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:34,047
Open the caplets so many of trainers books inside and said

199
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
I think that must have

200
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
Being the reason for his illness

201
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Time pass

202
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,031
Germany fought and Lost World War

203
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,615
And from the rubble of that to feed brew a liberal counterculture

204
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,063
Donna is Proclaim that art was dead expressionist films afford the darkness of the Soul Berliner is past lay down

205
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:01,695
Hours at cabarets nudists challenged traditional modesty Burlington in 1920s

206
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
It was sent off

207
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
All forms of

208
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
Different m

209
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
Life experiments

210
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
And at the center of all this

211
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,679
Was a physician named Magnus hirschfeld

212
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,495
And he founded the institute for

213
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,055
All those people which had another

214
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,359
Sexual orientation than usual

215
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,943
Hirschfeld also promoted acceptance of transgenderism

216
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,527
STD prevention contraception and women's emancipation

217
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
He wrote that

218
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,111
The woman who needs to be liberated most

219
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
Woman in every man

220
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
Handsome men

221
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
Liberated moose

222
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,839
What does liberal Renaissance in Berlin

223
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
Would not last for long

224
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,591
As a Nazi party Rose to power hirschfeld Institute for sexual Sciences had become a Target

225
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
Magnus hirschfeld

226
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,663
Was very famous at the

227
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,687
Time he was

228
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
Gay he was a Jew and he was left it

229
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,111
The German Student Union

230
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
Rated Magnus hirschfeld Institute

231
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,999
They threw many of his books onto the street and burn them

232
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,583
This is 4 days before Nazis all across Germany

233
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,911
Started burning books by Jewish authors in public rallies

234
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,495
But even so the new regime didn't get rid of every

235
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,311
The rain start Library they said we have to keep

236
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
Keep them because

237
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,407
Have to know what the enemy rides and two

238
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
5%

239
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,271
Magnus hirschfeld books went into the gifts Ron

240
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,439
12 years later in 1945

241
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
The Nazis had lost the war

242
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,303
And now their own literature including of course mine,

243
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
Was thrown into the gift Ron

244
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,935
The Hope was to Dina to find Germany and build a new Society

245
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Germany did not

246
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Become a noose

247
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
He became to new Society

248
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,639
Are the Communist barrier between East and West Berlin Rose higher

249
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Stronger

250
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,455
The more determined Grosso Villalobos

251
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
On the Border

252
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
East berliners are forced to evacuate their home

253
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
Has the Communist police moved

254
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
To prevent their escape

255
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,791
The two germanys would eventually each have their own government

256
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,863
Their own culture and of course their own Library

257
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,679
And the contents of each side's gifts Ron

258
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
Became a mirror for what was deemed dangerous

259
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
In east and west

260
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
So the Nazi stuff

261
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Mine comp

262
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
And the writings of Joseph Goebbels and

263
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Alfred Rosenberg

264
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,479
This could be found in gift shrunks in both west

265
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Andy's

266
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:38,879
West Germany actually thinned out there GIF trunk overtime allowing more access to

267
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
So-called pernicious information

268
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,487
In East Germany it was the opposite

269
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,303
East Germany was dictatorship so they were

270
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,375
I like a very obvious and straight censorship

271
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:54,239
Western Print material wasn't normally accessible this is Elena Demco

272
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,543
While she was a student at University

273
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,103
She was looking to read some band check poetry

274
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
And with the help of an idealistic professor

275
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,527
She was able to get access to the room where the University Library kept

276
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
Gets banned material

277
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,111
What's the nickname Ross gift home

278
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Poison room

279
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,743
Nervous and excited when I went there

280
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
It's a very

281
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Representative

282
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
19th century building

283
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:26,495
So you have to go to the major staircase and go up to Majors Steakhouse

284
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
And keep going up

285
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:34,175
Smallest smallest staircase

286
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:39,551
Spiral staircase

287
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,343
Houston in front of pantry door

288
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
It was made of iron and had

289
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
Big circular

290
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
Glass window made of Barista class

291
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,863
Henna tattoos at the same time in order to open the door

292
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,215
Past the bunker door was a dark room

293
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,799
Western looking lady check to see if your name was on the list

294
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
Then she got your book

295
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
And let you go through another door

296
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,967
And then you went into the like small reading room

297
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
Ritual synonym

298
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,599
Station of glass

299
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
Very very pleasant sunny

300
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Place

301
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,303
In East Germany to get strong had become a place you can visit

302
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,119
And in this library at the University of Leipzig

303
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:31,519
The gift shrunk was actually a pretty lovely place to be

304
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
Define assuage

305
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
Elena have been hoping to meet other counter

306
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
Who were also there to read politically

307
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,551
Literature I was disappointed realizing that the other

308
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
People we're not reading politically

309
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
Relevant literature

310
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
And when I saw

311
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
You're pretty students

312
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,023
Reading fish literature I thought OKC Jedi prophecy

313
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,583
Get access to this room to read

314
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
Fashion magazines from the West

315
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
Within about a year of Elena visiting the poison room

316
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
The East German government had collapsed

317
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
The Border was opened

318
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
In Germany

319
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
Was reunified

320
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
All across the former East

321
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
Gift trunks

322
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Frank

323
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:16,063
Literature critical of the East German government magazines that showed life in a capitalist Society

324
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,135
They were taken out from behind iron bunker doors

325
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
And returned to normal circulation

326
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:30,399
Today the physical rooms and cabinets that once served as gift trunks all across Germany are mostly empty

327
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,959
Their contents return to the regular stacks

328
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
But on everything

329
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,823
Today mine comp is kept in what step on counter cause

330
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Assault

331
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
Virtual gift wrap

332
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:46,527
A virtual gift song meaning there's no physical box or even a particular room cordoning off the books from the

333
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
Rather the library relies on the infrastructure of their catalog and checkout system to create a series of checkpoints between

334
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
When the user

335
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,511
In books at the library wants to keep an eye on

336
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
When you search for mine comp in the database

337
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
You can't just order it

338
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
You have to go see Susie

339
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,543
Susie coolback was the librarian on the desk.

340
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
And she said the first thing to do

341
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
Go to our

342
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
The permission

343
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,807
And as long as you don't seem like a Nazi you can get a copy of Minecon

344
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
No problem

345
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,927
The process of accessing Minecon from the Bavarian State Library should feel

346
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,255
Pretty familiar to anyone who's ever got material from an academic Library

347
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
If your underage

348
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
18

349
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
From the parents

350
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
Speed runs like a god

351
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
Peasants

352
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Go seek

353
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Well

354
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
Good luck getting through Susie

355
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:44,383
If someone says I want to get this book because I want to learn how to be a Nazi

356
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
Then comes in

357
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,527
Though if you do go to the trouble of checking out mine comp

358
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
Just don't go in expecting too much

359
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
I read it

360
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,143
These days of course you don't need a library to read mine Kampf in Germany

361
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,471
It's not hard to find a copy at an antiquarian bookstore

362
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,287
And a text has been on the internet for at least a decade

363
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
Cuz you can get Nazi literature

364
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,455
In the internet and so on but even if the book is readily available on the internet

365
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,551
Stephan calendar says the library still has responsibility

366
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,855
To try to control who leads their copies

367
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
And for what purpose

368
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
Even if it's

369
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,999
Anachronistically have to be a little careful

370
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,815
Not a little bit have to be careful with

371
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
Part of

372
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Law Library

373
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,447
