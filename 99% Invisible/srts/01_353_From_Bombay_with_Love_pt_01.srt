Constipation

Abdominal pain and bloating

It's not that bad to take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,072

I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,512
Deepa boss they grew up in a very small town in Southern India

25
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,048
With meanly books

26
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,072
To keep her company

27
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm an only child so there was no one to satisfy

28
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,240
Fight with and play with at home

29
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,056
And she didn't have many links to the outside world

30
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:22,176
This was the early 90s before email took off or AOL chat rooms realize there

31
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,968
Creepy potential

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
That's producer of Vivien Leigh

33
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,320
But one day when she was 10 years old

34
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,928
Deepest father brought her home a children's magazine with potential penpals listed in the back

35
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,512
Back then the idea of the pen pal was very popular

36
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
Do have a penpal who lived

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,096
I brought was with a big tank

38
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,424
They were pen pals listed from all over the world

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,728
Asia Europe South America

40
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,568
Antifa decided to write to two girls living in Russia

41
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,616
But there was a problem

42
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,992
This particular magazine actually came from a second-hand shop and was completely out of date

43
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,320
The magazines that my dad phone for me love

44
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,136
I think the early eighties or so so I would

45
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:08,512
And I found them much later in the 90s so that was almost a third of 728 year Gap

46
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:13,120
But even though seven years has passed since they listed their addresses in that magazine

47
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
These two Russian girls

48
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
Who are teenagers at the spa

49
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
Actually wrote back

50
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,800
People actually still have a lot of these old letters

51
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,128
In redmi 1 from one of her Penthouse named Marina

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
Audio Depot

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
How are you

54
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
Thanks for your letter and photos

55
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,528
I was glad to see your letter

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
I have a family

57
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
Mother father

58
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
And sister

59
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
I found this very small

60
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
But I like

61
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,744
It starts off pretty predictable

62
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,072
Send Marina starts talkin about some of her favorite

63
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
My favorite actors are

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,216
Shahrukh Khan Aamir Khan Govinda

65
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
Anil Kapoor

66
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
Karishma Kapoor

67
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
They were all

68
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Indian

69
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
I like India

70
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,456
Indian films dances songs except

71
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,760
I have the collection photos

72
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320
Actors songs from Indian film

73
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,904
Deepest Russian pen pals were obsessed with Indian films

74
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
More specifically Bollywood

75
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,512
They seem very very interested in

76
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
Bollywood

77
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,400
Bollywood is the Hindi language film industry that comes out of Mumbai India

78
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,704
It's a portmanteau of Bombay

79
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,264
The former name of Mumbai where these films are produced

80
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
And Hollywood

81
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,384
Bollywood is often conflated with the film industry as a whole

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,712
But really it's just one very flamboyant

83
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
Slice of it

84
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
It's usually packed with elaborate song and dance sequences

85
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
Fight between Good and Evil

86
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,648
A beautiful hero in heroine

87
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
There's very little data

88
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
Left foot into

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
Sedation so you know that okay there's this guy this is good

90
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
They going to fall in love and then

91
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
So just end up happily ever after

92
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,704
It's a fairytale I think that's that's the best way to

93
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Describe

94
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
When she first got the letters

95
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,872
Deep I didn't think much about her penpals Bollywood fascinator

96
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,200
It wasn't until years later that it's trucker

97
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,528
Just how hot it seem that these girls all the way in Russia

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
You so much about

99
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
Shahrukh Khan

100
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Anil Kapoor

101
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,256
I don't think I really processed what they meant that somebody's been so far away in some small town witch

102
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
Probably was

103
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,095
Just like to know the small town I was growing up in

104
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,631
Before the internet

105
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
Why were they interested in

106
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,751
Movies that even be probably weren't watching as

107
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
What deeper didn't know that

108
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,199
What time was that Russian Bollywood fandom wasn't unique to her pen pals childhood experience at all

109
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,271
1950s right up to the collapse of the USSR

110
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,855
People in the Soviet Union were completely infatuated

111
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
With Indian Cinema

112
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
While the United States was in the grips

113
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Beatlemania

114
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
Bollywood Mania

115
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
Was taking over the USSR

116
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,655
There's even a famous story about an Indian actor in the 1960s who is visiting mosque

117
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
He was quietly waiting for attack

118
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,823
Out of nowhere she was swarmed by Russian Bollywood crazed fans

119
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
He jumped into a taxi to escape

120
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
But instead of the car racing forward

121
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
It started rising up into the air

122
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:13,855
These fans had lifted the taxi over their heads and carried it down the street

123
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,183
It's possible that story has been embellished over the years

124
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,303
But it speaks with very real very intense connection between the two countries

125
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
India and the Soviet Union

126
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Had completely different

127
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
Politics

128
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
Languages and cultures

129
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Good for a brief time

130
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,055
These two Nations found the actually had a lot in common

131
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
And realize this

132
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
Dual love

133
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
Of movies

134
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,527
In the beginning in the twenties especially film

135
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Stop

136
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
To be

137
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
Very important economically

138
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,695
Together with 4th grade brought lots of money

139
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
2 + 8

140
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,583
This is Carole radziwill golf film critic and historian based in Moscow

141
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,887
He's basically the Russian Leonard maltin

142

Samsung speaker

144
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,799
And in the early years of Cinema rossakoff says that Soviet directors were at the

145
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
Forefront of filmmaking

146
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
Not just within the USSR

147
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
What in the world

148
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
Lenin himself said

149
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
Of all the Arts

150
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Brusque

151
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
The cinema

152
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
Is the most

153
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,647
He believed that a film had the power to reach the masses better than any artist medium

154
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,183
And that it could operate as

155
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
Art and propaganda

156
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
At the same time

157
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,535
When Stalin came to power

158
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
Scales tipped dramatically

159
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
In favor of propaganda

160
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,239
Everything was controlled even personally by Stalin so the censorship for

161
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
Was Freddie Hart

162
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,335
You have the crystallization of us cultural policy

163
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,407
Bethesda Row Cinema and the art and the

164
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
Jen everything else

165
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
Needs to follow a set of

166
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,855
This is due. Rajagopal and Senior lecturer of Eastern European studies

167
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
The University of Amsterdam

168
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:56,255
She said that this set of artistic rules was called socialist realism

169
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,143
Socialist realism dictated in a sense that all books and Philippines to have a standard narrative

170
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,959
Fillmore show Gloria proletariat struggle

171
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,751
Conrad does heroic Acts

172
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,359
All will see the ideal Soviet society and understand the true meaning of communism

173
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Roll credits

174
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,479
Socialist realism limited artistic creativity

175
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
And

176
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
World War II didn't help

177
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,903
A lot of the factories on Dorothy Industries at Cinema houses in theaters have to be closed down

178
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Carol razza coffee

179
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,535
Explains that the War caused a shift in the Soviet Union's moviemaking priority

180
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
Rather than spending money on me

181
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,119
Taking a bunch of movies a year

182
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
Soviet Union wanted to concentrate

183
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
I'm just making a

Cancel

185

A well-produced

186

Before the war

187
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Russia

188
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
Soviet Union made about

189
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
70 film speed

190
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,687
After the Warriors became five

191
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
Tencent

192
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
But yeah

193
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,527
The idea was to make fewer films

194
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,599
To make one only successful film

195
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
Impossible

196
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,695
The state wanted to focus on quality over

197
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
Which in some circumstances

198
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:00,767
This could be a good

199
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
But even at its best

200
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:08,447
Imagine of Hollywood was only producing five movies a year and those movies were Schindler's List

201
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
Million Dollar Baby

202
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,287
Sophie's Choice the Dear Hunter in 12 years

203
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,335
Their masterpieces

204
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:19,967
But going to the movies would be such a drag Cinema

205
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,807
So the USSR was producing fewer movies than ever

206
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
And the trajectory of Soviet Cinema

207
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
Mirror. Of Soviet life

208
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Strict censorship

209
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
Can a rejection

210
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
Anything remotely

211
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Bourgeois

212
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
Goodbye 1953

213
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
That would finally begin to change

214
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
With the death

215
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,751
Of Stalin

216
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Google book

217
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
Score of U

218
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
After the death of Stalin

219
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
Great changes in the film industry

220
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
In 1953

221
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
Nikita Khrushchev came to power

222
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,087
And he wanted to chart a new course forward for the nation

223
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:02,463
In 1956 you have this momentous event when push of gifts what is called the secret speech

224
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,327
Philippe is not so secret because it turned out within a few days everyone knew about it

225
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
Khrushchev denounced Stalin's cult

226
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Personality

227
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
It kicked off a period known as the

228
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
2crucial thot

229
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
Hundreds of thousands of prisoners released from Gulag political repression subsided and censorship was relaxed

230
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,991
The cruise ship also wanted to make ordinary citizens feel more free

231
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
And happy in their daily lives

232
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
Octopus hole

233
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
De-Stalinization as a

234
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
It's called in the 1950s is it

235
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,975
Kind of shift in the rhetoric about

236
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
How to

237
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,559
Address issues of everyday life

238
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
And part of this large debate

239
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
1%

240
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
Milk consumption

241
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
Is

242
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,263
Are people really having a good time I mean it really is as simple as that

243
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:53,919
Are people really having a good time is a simple question that marks an important shift in the government's priorities

244
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
Intrusive

245
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,527
Decided that one way to ensure that people were having a good time

246
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
What to get them back in the movie theater

247
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Turtles giving people a sense

248
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:09,023
Stability right the war is over now these aren't normal times

249
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
You can also just go to the movies

250
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
You can just hang up

251
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,143
Friends it's also practicality

252
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
Can you need to rebuild our economy

253
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,287
You need to draw people back into the Seattle you need to generate revenues

254
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
But in order to get people to go to the movies

255
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,431
USSR had to increase the amount of films playing in theaters

256
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,991
Which required importing more foreign film

257
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:36,159
America was the biggest movie producer at the time but this was the middle of the Cold War and a majority of

258
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
Hollywood films were seen is

259
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
Inappropriately

260
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Capitalist

261
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,071
And so the USSR went looking for someone else

262
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
A new fun friend

263
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,423
How to get entertain millions of fun starved Soviets

264
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,727
Without offending their political Sensibility

265
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
And it found the perfect candidate

266
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
In India

267
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,639
It was very important to the Soviet Union to have

268
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,687
A friend in India at the

269
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,735
The time in 1947

270
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
After years of fighting British colonial rule

271
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
India

272
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,623
Became an independent nation

273
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,719
Soviet Union at the time was looking to build relationships with developer

274
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Countries

275
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,327
And even though India wouldn't take an official side during the Cold War

276
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,887
It still looks like a promising choice for friendship

277
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
It was

278
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,263
A country that had a very strong Anti-Imperialist

279
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
Politics

280
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,103
And political sympathies amongus intellectual

281
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
Ansel

282
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,711
Both of these things made it actually very attractive

283
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Site

284
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
For the Soviet Union

285
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Try out

286
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
It's geopolitics

287
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,183
Baby it was that this would be a cultural exchange between the two Nations

288
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,743
Soviet Union would import Indian films

289
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,071
And India would import the same number of Soviet

290
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
To become cinematic penpals

291
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,263
In 1954 the Soviet Union took a big step towards this artistic partnership

292
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
I hosting an Indian film festival in Moscow

293
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
East Roosevelt

294
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
Huge event

295
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,199
In the beginning of the 50s

296
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
Because the Indian film

297
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Came to Russia

298
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
This is Carole radziwill

299
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
Russell golf was just a kid 19

300
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,671
Before but he still remembers this Fest

301
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
Spell because

302
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,511
It was the debut of a Bollywood film called avata

303
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,815
Which translates to the vagabond

304
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,007
Nevada centers around a Charlie Chaplin

305
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Trap character

306
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Forced into a life

307
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
The crime but

308
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,383
True love makes me see the error of his ways

309
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
Full of sentimental music

310
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
Lessons in Morality

311
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
Allied deep longing

312
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Stairs

313
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
Troubling misogyny was the biggest

314
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,183
Ever commercial success in Soviet Union that.

315
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:50,047
Navarro was literally the number one movie in 1954 in the USSR

316
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
Selling over 63 million ticket

317
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,143
To put that into perspective

318
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
The top grossing movie of 2017

319
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,519
Star Wars The Last Jedi sold 57 million ticket

320
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,359
I was born in 1966 so long

321
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,431
After but I do remember people singing

322
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,271
That song in this movie had such a such a

323
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
Can impact on the show Victorious

324
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
This is Anton Sea-Doos off

325
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,439
He grew up in Uzbekistan when it was still part of the USSR

326
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,791
And he remembers just how huge evado and other Indian films were for Soviet audience

327
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,607
After that first film festival in Moscow

328
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
Don't star Raj Kapoor

329
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,471
Quickly became a mega celebrity throughout the Soviet Union

330
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
Truck drivers had the

331
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
A photo

332
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
Although

333
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
Kapoor on their windshield

334
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
Next to Stalin

335
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,991
That Indian actor that we mentioned earlier the one who was mobbed by Russian fans and

336
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,295
Hoisted into the air in the taxi

337
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
That

338
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Was Raj Kapoor

339
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,439
It was so excited to see him that they apparently lifted his back

340
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Sheetz

341
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
Angela cat

342
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,167
Yet such was his popularity

343
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
In the US

344
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,311
Raj Kapoor became kind of a cultural Ambassador between the two car

345
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,871
When he visited Moscow and 19th

346
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
56

347
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,711
He spoke about the ways in which movies can bring their country

348
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
She's closer together

349
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:17,855
And even quoted Lennon's original feelings of what Cinema could accomplish

350
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Cinema

351
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,999
Is the greatest weapon tomorrow

352
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
And at the peak of their Bollywood craze

353
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
Soviet movie theaters

354
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
We're constantly showing Indian film

355
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,959
So they will be 20 movie theaters operating

356
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,031
From 10 a.m. till

357
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
2:10 p.m.

358
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
2 hours a day and

359
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
Have a good half of them will be playing

360
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Indian movies

361
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,223
And even the music from these films became popular

362
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
Maybe a little too popular

363
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,111
Neighbors in the apartment complex at

364
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
Family leave

365
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,439
Water playing Indian songs

366
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
On the vinyl

367
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
From 6 a.m. till

368
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Oakley midnight

369
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
Sometimes the same song

370
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
Over and over again

371
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,447
The ussr's intense love of Indian Cinema

372
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,519
Sometimes even seats into the content of Bollywood films

373
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:12,639
Deepa told me about a Raj Kapoor movie from 1955 called shree 420

374
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:18,015
Which the main character nods to the close relationship with the Soviet Union and one of the song

375
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:23,391
This is very old and very popular song called Mera joota Hai japani

376
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
I'm not

377
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
This is going to sound really bad

378
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:47,455
Mera joota Hai japani in English

379
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:56,671
If I'd known English standings

380
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
Listen Hindi Translate to

381
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
Buy shoes from Japan

382
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,327
My trousers are from England

383
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,655
But most importantly there's a lyric that says

384
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
The Hat on top of my head is from Russia

385
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,519
It's very curious.

386
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
LOL torpedo Sinatra.

387
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
Obviously a communist wrestling

388
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,455
Knowing that they have a very wide Russian audience and the

389
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
Sully's good marketing

390
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,807
Strategy to include them in the

391
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
Annoying the song

392
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,951
Upland

393
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,303
It's hard to say exactly why Bollywood

394
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,839
What became such a phenomenon

395
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
On in the Soviet Union

396
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,191
The reason is that they offered something you simply

397
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
Couldn't find in Soviet films

398
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,567
You do not see the kind of unbridled

399
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
Personal emotion that you

400
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
CNN

401
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
You know better

402
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
I mean those who don't like it

403
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
It's a It's Over the Top

404
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
Right here

405
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,295
See how Raja gopal and again

406
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
So it's

407
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
Innocent swear

408
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,463
You have a man and a woman and they fall in love and then you have

409
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,767
Full songs that are only about

410
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Falling in Love

411
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
Right and then you have

412
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,911
Dance sequences shot out in the nature

413
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
Avenue have

414
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:18,079
Rainfall at fault and a drenched and they're in love and their exultant and there is this

415
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
Unbridled

416
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,223
Tents to Indian cinema right and there are no boundaries

417
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,551
Do what you can feed and how you can express those feeling

418
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
But it wasn't just that Bollywood fell

419
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
Exotic and if

420
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,303
The exuberant sentimentality was certainly unfamiliar

421
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,863
There was also something deeply relatable

422
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
At the core of Indian Cinema

423
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,983
Indian and Soviet films were both often about

424
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
Self-sacrifice

425
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
A world divided into Good vs Evil

426
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
In class struggle

427
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:56,735
But logical Palin conducted a number of interviews of Indian film fans in the former Soviet Union

428
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
And a lot of them pointed to something though

429
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,831
We don't quite have a word for it

430
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,927
So I know the Russians would say to me ways to watch Indian movies

431
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,975
And a douche as they match

432
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
And the show is the Russian word for

433
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Seoul

434
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
The soul sister

435
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Talking about

436
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,887
Isn't an individual soul

437
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
Instead

438
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,471
Shaw is kind of a nationalist

439
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
Or a collective identity

440
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,615
The duchenne that the Russians like to talk about their soul

441
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,919
Is Wanda in Jaws it is

442
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,503
It's it has been through hard history but it in Georgia

443
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
It's resilient

444
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
It's kind of

445
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,367
Spiritual in that sense of not being attached

446
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,439
Immaterial Pursuit Santo dystocia

447
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,999
They believed was one that they shared with Indian

448
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:49,215
Bollywood films played on theater screens in the USSR right up into the later years of the Soviet Union

449
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:54,335
The towards the 1980s a new technology change this cinematic relationship

450
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Forever

451
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,943
The end of the Soviet Union

452
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,759
Coincided with the new Arrow

453
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
BHS

454
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
And that's

455
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
Exactly when

456
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
Arnold

457
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
And fellow made the

458
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
Lately

459
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
Removed

460
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,303
Raj Kapoor and other Indian actress from

461
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,607
From the screens of ordinary

462
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
Soviet

463
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Audience

464
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,703
In the final years of the USSR

465
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
Rather than watching shree 420

466
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,287
Where is Zita and Gita

467
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,151
A lot of people preferred watching bootleg videos of Conan the Barbarian and RAM

468
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
The Soviet Union collapsed

469
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,759
American film and television quickly

470
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
Flooded the market

471
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,599
Hollywood isn't totally gone

472
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,463
There's still a channel on Russian TV that broadcasts Indian films and television

473
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
Twenty-four hours a day

474
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,583
And if you ever do karaoke in Uzbekistan

475
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,983
You might just hear an old man singing songs from Nevada

476
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Okay so that's the first Apple Store

477
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
But

478
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,407
This was a one-to-one exchange right so

479
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,991
Now we're going to talk about all this Soviet films that were popular in India

480
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,783
And how deep abasta grew up with

481
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,599
Posters of Soviet film stars in her bedroom

482
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
Not so much

483
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,207
We never watched any Russian Film in India

484
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
In those years

485
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,351
Unlike Indian films push for a widely beloved

486
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
All parts of the USSR

487
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,471
Sophia films for just not popular in India

488
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,055
Any movie theaters weren't great at Distributing Soviet movies

489
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
And when they did

490
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,431
They often screen them late at night when no one would even want to go see a movie

491
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
How do you spell

492
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
You know

493
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,295
Devious and Samba soon's I mean

494
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,367
You know you watch them

495
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,415
Hey it's not the best

496
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
Hours

497
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,511
Seriously you try watching tarkovsky stalker at 11 p.m.

498
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
And staying conscious

499
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,839
I tried I failed I never look back

500
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
They bought

501
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Almost

502
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,471
They distributed them much better than we ever did this

503
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,823
Offense will much more popular than their sons were

504
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,591
And India

505
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
The real

506
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,735
Soviet films just didn't have the same mainstream appeal is Indian films did

507
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:14,367
Course there were surely Indian film nerds with thick frame glasses who can appreciate Russian Art House

508
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,416
But on the whole

509
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,744
People in India just born is drawn to socialist realism

510
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,864
But do you know Soviet film never really took off in India

511
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,960
The goal of a two way cultural exchange wasn't a total failure

512
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
It just took another form

513
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
Here's Depot Boston

514
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
Soviet books

515
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,152
But flooded into the country in all languages

516
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,992
The USSR made Soviet literature widely available

517
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
All over India

518
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Beautiful

519
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
Hardbound Russian class

520
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,392
4 translated into multiple Indian languages

521
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
I'm available and

522
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
Incredibly low prices

523
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,768
They would several generations of Indians

524
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Who grew up on these books

525
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:58,912
So we had everything from the tallest I pushed in the siskiyous

526
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
All the greats of

527
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
Russian literature

528
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:05,824
2 children's books to Science and Technology textbooks

529
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
Deepa told me there wasn't even a bookstore

530
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,736
But her bookshelf at home was filled with great works from Russian author

531
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
In fact I think I was

532
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
About

533
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
1011

534
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,160
When i picked up maxim gorkys mother

535
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,952
That's all I remember was my first

536
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
Bigger.

537
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
Novel

538
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:29,120
Assassination because it was like a big booger

539
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
Baton

540
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
It was hard born

541
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
Shooting on to read

542
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,824
Pushkin selected works and Dostoevsky the idiot all before the age of 17

543
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
People grew up and became a writer

544
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,480
And she believes she has a lot of growing up surrounded by Russian literature

545
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
Obviously

546
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
I know reading these books at that

547
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
Age

548
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,136
Definitely influence the way I

549
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,464
Already know the reactants now the way I

550
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
Right

551
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
Snow

552
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Because

553
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
I did them at a very formative

554
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Edge

555
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,888
And I still have a deep connection to

556
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
How to tease

557
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
To these books

558
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,592
As I was talking with Deepa

559
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:14,176
I kept thinking about the intention of this whole cultural Exchange

560
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,712
The influencer

561
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
So I asked her

562
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,832
If she thought it all about the fact that those books

563
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,392
Or part of some larger geopolitical

564
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,416
Propaganda scheme

565
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes I do think about this whole propaganda side of it

566
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
But for me

567
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
It was

568
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,120
Literature for itself

569
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
To be enjoyed because it is great writing

570
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,800
I don't think anyone's going to no one's going to remember a politician speech

571
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,128
But you talk about books are you talk about Sin tomorrow to talk about

572
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,176
Music and that stays with you

573
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,200
Casablanca dress

574
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:09,728
How exactly did the Soviets watch all those American movies that flooded into the Soviet Union at a time when not that money

575
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,008
People had a VCR

576
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,312
Will they watch them on the movie Buy

577
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
Vivian tells me that story

578
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
After this

579
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
You

580
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
You inspired it

581
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,576
Xfinity create internet that puts you in charge

582
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
Bra

583
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,136
Your movie marathons are better

584
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,672
When you can stream them all night

585
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:33,024
Video chats for Grandpa's birthday it should be possible from anywhere in your house

586
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,840

587

589
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,472
So Xfinity reimagined Wi-Fi

590
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,520

591
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,592

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered World a man-made sound

611
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,144
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

612
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,520
Just talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remedy for all hearing.

Okay

620
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,000
Dim the living room lights

Okay

623
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:17,216
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

624
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,032
Makes for a much more natural experience

625
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
Turn the living room lights on

626
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,664

Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

633
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
Right here

634
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
NPR

635
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
So I'm back in the studio with Vivian Lee who

636
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
Prieston reported that story

637
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
And

638
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,336
A little piece of this story that I forgot you started that

639
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
Didn't fit

640
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
In the story

641
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:03,552
Yes that is very exciting for me a while back I stumbled across this article

642
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
The Atlantic

643
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,856
By someone named Del Mar

644
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:13,280
So Eleanor is an English professor at Biola University now but he was born in the city called Baku in the

645
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,584
The Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist

646
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,936
Republic and he grew up watching a lot of movies in the Soviet Union

647
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
Before the fall

648
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
USSR before 1991

649
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,568
Yes he was born in 1979

650
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:31,968
And he said that the 80s were kind of an odd time to be a young person and a movie buff in the USSR

651
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:38,368
Because it's pretty close to the collapse of the USSR and that tension and anxiety tended to seep into stove

652
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Media

653
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
The 80s

654
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
Work

655
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
Dark and cynical

656
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
I think that was rude

657
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,816
Did in the films and shows

658
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
Words that were made

659
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
It's a lot of it was

660
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
It's just sort of

661
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
Dark

662
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:54,240
Critical and hopeless

663
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
We talked about

664
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,384
Is making people turn to Bollywood Cinema to have some hope and something like that did that what he did

665
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
He told me that his

666
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
His first crush was

667
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,552
Hema Malini from Zita and Gita

668
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,136
But he actually watched a lot of Hollywood

669
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:17,536
You still didn't make it into the Soviet Union

670
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
Import American phones

671
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:25,472
Cold War there just very selective of what they would screen and Stones were heavily censored or edited

672
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,080
And Elmer told me about this kind of funny example of a classic film that they used

673
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,640
Play the one I always think about is

674
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Some Like It Hot

675
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,504
Was Marilyn Monroe in the Soviet Union it was

676
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
Actually translated

677
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,344
Girls only in jazz

678
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
What is better

679
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:54,656
He told me that no scenes were often cut or edited out order

680
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,704
Is translated completely differently

681
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
Need to change the contacts

682
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,520
A lot of them or

683
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
Spicy lamb

684
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
Which was also

685
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,128
Cleaned up and there were some scenes

686
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
That were complete

687
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,200
LeConte or translated differently

688
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:13,600
But towards the end of the 70s bootleg movies were a lot easier to get ahold of because of the VCR player

689
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:18,720
And so this is how a lot of people like Almar First Watch uncensored American

690
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,280
The way you say VCR player is if

691
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:26,656
You are of an age in which he's never touched one really thick

692
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:30,240
Plastic dhs's

693
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
So you should just say VCR

694
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:40,224
So he had a VCR player

695
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,784
Yeah it's like this is how he first watch

696
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,576
Uncensored American Pie

697
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,208
What you told me the first action film he saw was first Blood the original Rambo movie yes

698
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
Sand

699
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:57,120
It's kind of funny you eat like it wasn't even that these movies were exciting because they were illegal

700
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,936
But compared to Soviet films American films

701
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,216
Just offered a lot of

702
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
Stimulation

703
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
It's kind of like a barrage on the

704
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,592
I just remember the violin

705
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
The blood and

706
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,408
Sweat and machine guns

707
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,712
And yeah

708
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,272
Sylvester Stallone's bulging muscles

709
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:20,928
Can Boost phones were not County Fair shuttle tickets

710
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,488
At least in Baku where Elmer's from

711
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:28,608
People got pretty creative with how they scream these movies because they're still illegal at this point

712
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,448
I'm so he actually grew up watching bootleg Hollywood films in video bands

713
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
So tell me about

714
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,824
It's so in certain parts of the Soviet Union like from probably like the

715
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
70s to about the 90s

716
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,688
There is a popular form of transportation called the mushrooms

717
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,992
Sort of like a cross

718
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
Between a taxi

719
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Panda bus

720
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
And they were these

721
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,856
Latvian Maids

722
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
Mini buses

723
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
It was like The Rock

724
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
People refer

725
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
Graphics

726
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,424
So during the daisies were just public transit but at night some of these rough drivers would convert their buses

727
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,728
Is into many mobile movie theaters

728
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
Interview they have

729
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,664
But TVs and VCRs are screens I got to get work really super common for

730
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,808
People that own their own VCRs in their homes on so this made it just a lot easier to bring movies to larger groups

731
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
Two people to watch together

732
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,112
And so are these

733
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
Land was he like it

734
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:30,560
What were they like ice cream trucks were they just would show up there what is actually exactly what it was like it was it was

735
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,864
Weird mouth and there's like no official schedule

736
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
I compared it to it like

737
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,192
Can ice cream van or

738
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
It just showed up

739
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,264
People be like the video van is here

740
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,800
Annabelle the kids

741
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
The yard

742
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,200
Did they get inside the van and watch a movie

743
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,064
I guess it's kind of like a Alegria version of watching a movie

744
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,136
What are those Entertainment Systems in a family minivan

745
00:31:55,392 --> 00:32:01,536
The television and the VCR would be in the front of the van right behind the bus driver seat and there be curtains

746
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,352
On the windows to block out light and make it a little bit

747
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
More discreet from the outside

748
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,912
Will Sadler

749
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
Would sit in the bus

750
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
Spacing

751
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Forward

752
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
And

753
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,288
One of my Vivid memories is

754
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Smell

755
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,104
Stale cigarettes

756
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
They're all day

757
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,968
Sometimes people would actually be

758
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:26,880
10 year old smoking in a bus

759
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,440
But something that I thought was interesting was

760
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,232
The weight of these phones are translated

761
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
So it was

762
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:36,864
It was really common that the people who dug these movies into Russian

763
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,632
She speaks

764
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
Azerbaijani

765
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,520
Screened in Russian by translators

766
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:48,640
Or journalist or film critics by day and at night they would illegally translate Hollywood movies

767
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:52,224
And usually it was directly over the original soundtrack

768
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,600
Usually guy and usually in one take

769
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,928
Remove the old Dilaudid

770
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,952
Medela

771
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,280
I actually have a clip here for you to hear what it sounds like

772
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
So this is

773
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,352
A clip from the movie The Thing

774
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,144
And I

775
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:18,336
I don't know what the hell's in there

776
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,616
Dance 3D shelter

777
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
PayPal

778
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Yellow poop

779
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
Choke

780
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
Muckleshoot bingo

781
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,088
Homophonic animal trivia

782
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,696
He's not really selling it

783
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,144
What is strange introduction to American culture I can't imagine what you must think that America is the

784
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,448
Place in the world

785
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,032
But I did say something kind of funny witches

786
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:54,688
That because of the way these films were dubbed over with you being able to hear both English and Russian the same time

787
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:00,576
He has a theory that it made him better at acquiring new languages

788
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,648
How I got so good and bad English we work

789
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440

2006

794
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,192
English is almost like I barely detect

795
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
Any kind of accident

796
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
This is

797
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:26,432
Based on his own wild speculation with a lot of people grow watching these movies but English is very good

798
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:30,784
There's actually great documentary called Chuck Norris vs communism

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine
