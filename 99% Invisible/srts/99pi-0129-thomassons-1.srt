I'm Roman Mars

27
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,624
Cities

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,904
Like living things

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,208
Evolve slowly over time

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,560
Buildings and structures get added and renovated and removed

31
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
And in this process

32
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,424
There are bits and pieces I get left behind

33
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
Little vestiges

34
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
Humans have tailbone

35
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,776
But no tails

36
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
Whales have pelvic bones

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
But no legs

38
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
And cities

39
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,176
Have stairs that lead to nowhere

40
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
Telephone poles without wiring

41
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
And pipes that carry nothing at all

42
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,600
That's producer Avery trufelman

43
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
Most of the time

44
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,720
These architectural leftovers rest or crumble or get taken down

45
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
But other times

46
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
These messages are not removed

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,096
And they remain in the urban organism

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,144
And sometimes

49
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,704
Even though they no longer serve

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
Any discernible purpose whatsoever

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,312
They are actually maintained

52
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
They get cleaned and Polished

53
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
And repaired and repainted

54
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
Just because they're there

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,856
These architectural leftovers first caught the attention of an artist in Japan named a Cossack Elegante

56
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
This is a 1972

57
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,208
One day he was on his lunch break with some friends

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,768
And as they were walking to lunch they came across this

59
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Staircase

60
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
That went up

61
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
And then back down

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
But there is no door at the top

63
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
He basically just walked up

64
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
And then walk back down

65
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,776
And there was a piece of the railing that have been recently fixed

66
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
Something clicked with him when he saw that

67
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
Is Matt Fargo

68
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,432
He's translated into English

69
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,992
Himself doesn't speak English

70
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
And he's up there in the years and he's not currently doing any interviews but his passion for these City vestiges

71
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
Bread to Matt Fargo

72
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
Very rare for 1

73
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,000
There's not a lot of

74
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
Facets of our life these days that are allowed to be

75
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
Completely

76
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,728
Urban leftovers as artistic byproducts of the city

77
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,800
He photographed all the things you can find that were both

78
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
Vestigial and maintain

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
It began publishing his findings in a magazine column

80
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,480
Company by musings about each object

81
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
Set for example

82
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,344
This is what a casa Gala wrote about those stairs to nowhere

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,648
Everything in our capitalist Society

84
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
To have a purpose

85
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,304
So where does that leave this particular staircase could you even call it a staircase

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
But I would let you keep into a window

87
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
Of course you can

88
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,704
You can only call it art

89
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
A work of art

90
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
Shaped like a staircase

91
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:01,408
People began to senda casa gala pictures of similar architectural leftovers that they found

92
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,272
And it is call him a casa Gala would evaluate their submissions on two criteria

93
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,112
Were they truly completely useless

94
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
+ 2

95
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Had they been recently maintained

96
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,839
In 1985 a casa Gala published a book of these collected photographs and writings

97
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:24,191
Which Matt Fargo translated into English for the first time in 2009

98
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
And of course

99
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
Now Matt finds these things everywhere

100
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,079
And they've changed the way he sees his around

101
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Architecture is

102
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Changing it

103
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
Being amended

104
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,967
So it is fun to think about how how do we end up

105
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
Where we are right now

106
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
Instupendo weapon roof of how it

107
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
Formed over years

108
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
Static immutable thing

109
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,999
The changing nature of the city was especially clear to a casa Gala as a Japanese artist

110
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,071
Japan's rapid reorganization after World War II

111
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,119
Created a lot of these City vestiges

112
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
Akasa gawa

113
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,215
Coined a term for these kinds of urban leftovers

114
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
Those that are again

115
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
Both totally purposeless

116
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
And

117
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,103
Regularly maintained

118
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
He called them

119
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Thomason

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
It comes from

121
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
Gary Thomasson

122
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Who was a

123
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Baseball player American baseball player

124
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
And I really good one

125
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,255
Gary Thompson played for the LA Dodgers the New York Yankees

126
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
And the San Francisco Giants

127
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,863
And then he was snatched up by another team

128
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Also called the Giant

129
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
The yomiuri Giants

130
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
Which is like the Yankees

131
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Japan

132
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
They win a lot of title

133
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,359
And also incidentally Otsego is favorite

134
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
Baseball team

135
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
Look at it in Tokyo

136
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
They hired him to come over

137
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
And if it is an exorbitant amount of money

138
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,903
But in this new country on this new team the great Slugger Gary Thompson

139
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,439
Lost his stride

140
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
You got there and

141
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Could not

142
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
Hitler Japanese

143
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
Picture for the life of

144
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,679
He actually set the all-time strikeout record

145
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
In Japan in 1981

146
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
And he remained in this rut

147
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,591
Until his contract ran out the following year

148
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
So you basically ended up

149
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Sitting on the bench

150
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
And collecting a lot of money

151
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
Miss after miss

152
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
Gary Thomasson gain the nickname

153
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
With human fan

154
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
You know for

155
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
Swinging about around and only move in the air

156
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
And so this kind of

157
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
Useless player that was being

158
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
Fiscally maintains

159
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095

160
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375

Which by the way is entitled hyperart Thomasson

163
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,103
The American Publishers wanted to get a conversation going stateside

164
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,687
They collaborated with a team of artists and photographers to

165
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,247
Define thomason's all around San

166
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,551
Which is where the publisher was based at

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,951
It was partly its own project it was partly to promote the buck and the idea

168
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:59,839
And she and collaborator Alan Manalo took us on their own, some tour can you find them all of his City

169
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:06,239
Marshall will go down all the time assassin's that Claire and

And outside the stadium on a drawbridge named after former giant Lefty o'doul be on the Plaza named after former

Willie Mays

180
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,583
He found some objects unofficially named after former Giant

181
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,703
Gary Thomasson there's two on one on each side they look like little

182
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471

183
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
Sentry guards

184
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
So picture this

185
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
There's a drawbridge

186
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
And on either side

187
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Adidas lifting arm Gates

188
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,247
You know like the barriers that lower at railroad crossings to keep a car from moving forward

189
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,575
But next to these modern lifting arm Gates

190
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
Are the old model

191
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Or what's left of them

192
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Their arms were

193
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
But the bass

194
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Still there

195
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
And this

196
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,791
Old useless Bass

197
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
Is still maintained

198
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
They actually took the trouble to move the damn thing

199
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
But they didn't remove it

200
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,751
And they had it painted before

201
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
So we we

202
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,823
Cannot figure out why it still here

203
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
They like to do the same color as the bridge black

204
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:22,783
It's kind of industrial black and these thomason's were some of the only indisputable examples that Claire and Allen found

205
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,087
There plenty of things are in the city that are just derelict

206
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
It's the maintenance

207
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
That makes it

208
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
A true Thompson

209
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:35,327
Clarin Allen drove us to a loading dock by the San Francisco Marina and pointed out a staircase that let you know where

210
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:40,703
Classic Thomasson upon closer look we weren't so certain I think

211
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
I don't think it has been repainted

212
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
If you look at the bottom

213
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,127
Topeak Fades into inches

214
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,711
Railings over there they're all

215
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
Yeah in Ruston

216
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
So that

217
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
The four of us huddled around this

218
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,671
Railing and try to figure out if the rest was painted over

219
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,719
Which would mean that it was a Thomason

220
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
Or the paint was rusted over

221
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
Which would make it not a Thomas

222
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,399
It looks like it's freshly painted but then we're figuring it wasn't in that it

223
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
Hasn't been used on

224
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
So that's why I didn't look like a

225
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
He doesn't have mixer

226
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Haircuts on it

227
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
Business course is part of the fun of Thomason

228
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,871
Anyone that does look at broken-down City parts

229
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
But it takes

230
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
Active examination and attention

231
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
To assess if this object

232
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Is

233
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
Truly useless

234
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,831
And has been cared for

235
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
Is detailed look and debate

236
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,719
Is what a casa Gala was encouraging his writings and publications

237
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
I'm so we thought we would imitate that with our website

238
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,327
Clear teamed up with Matt Fargo

239
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
The translator

240
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,935
To create a blog where people could offer up their own potential Thomason

241
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
For analysis and debate

242
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:52,127
And I'm so people were actually using it and sending in there at the Thomas and small over

243
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
There are submissions

244
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,759
In this commentary as to whether or not they met the definition of a Thomason

245
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,343
And we got a lot of really beautiful pictures that's transmitter Matt Fargo again

246
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
And then one day

247
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,951
They got a submission that was definitely not

248
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
Thomason

249
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,303
Or maybe it was the truest Thomas end of the mall

250
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
One day we got one that was to

251
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,143
Big picture of a middle finger

252
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
And it said Thank you for

253
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
Making

254
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
My family

255
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,775
Forever famous or something like that

256
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
News from Gary Thomas

257
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Daughter

258
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
That middle finger was a pretty clear sign

259
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
The Thomasson family

260
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
Is not pleased

261
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,319
If indeed that is actually gay Thomas and his daughter he submitted it

262
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,159
But either way the family declined to comment for this story

263
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,463
Brings us to another debate

264
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
Me on whether or not something is a

265
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Thomason

266
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,095
Is it fair to call these things Thomas ends

267
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
At all

268
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,215
Gary Thomasson with a remarkable baseball player

269
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
Bro long time

270
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,847
And just being a professional baseball player in and of itself is amazing

271
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,175
Hitting a baseball going 90 miles per hour

272
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Is about

273
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
The hardest thing to do in professional sports

274
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
If you are

275
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
Fantastic attic

276
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
You'll fail

277
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
70% of the time

278
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,231
Combine that with Thompson getting on in years the stress of living abroad

279
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,327
And any number of other things that could have been going on in his life at the time

280
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,911
Totally understandable that he wasn't the Slugger that he was

281
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,727
The San Francisco Giants

282
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
He followed baseball

283
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
Google

284
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
Yusuf

285
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
Of Gary Thomas

286
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,455
It was a cuz I got was big fear we know when we told him we want

287
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
I don't know about

288
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,599
In a publishing an English because it might be really embarrassing for

289
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
The Thomasson family in

290
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
Don't want to hurt anything like he's a

291
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Is sweet man

292
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:47,583
Matt himself was pretty nervous about the Thomas and Family's reaction I can't imagine what he would say

293
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
Yeah I was hoping

294
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
No Theta

295
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
Nothing but love for him in that

296
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
Better cuz I got was

297
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
Really really nervous about that

298
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,103
But not so nervous takasegawa wouldn't publish the book

299
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
And unfortunately

300
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
The name Thompson

301
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
Works well

302
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Cassie

303
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,087
And maybe it's kind of mean

304
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,159
In fact when I first heard about Thomas Hobbes I thought it was really mean

305
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:16,511
But then I tried to remember all the baseball players I could from the 1970s

306
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
When I came up with

307
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Something like

308
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Board games

309
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
And now because of a casa Gala

310
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Gary Thomasson

311
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
Has transcended

312
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Even

313
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,031
Pete Rose and Reggie Jackson

314
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,823
Enjoying the immortal ranks

315
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
The eponym

316
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Cardigan

317
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
Leotard

318
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Guillotine

319
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Sandwich

320
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
Silhouette

321
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:44,927
However hurtful the useless title might be, one could argue

322
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
Is ultimately a positive one

323
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
Thomason's are delightful

324
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Define

325
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
They have inspired artists

326
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,167
Translators performers in urban explorers around the world

327
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,007
Thomas and our Treasures waiting to be discovered

328
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
And analyzed

329
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,063
Plus if you need to get a gift for the Urban Design Enthusiast who has everything I'm thinking on Gary Thomas and baseball card

330
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Beef

99% invisible with Bruce this week by Avery truffelman

332

Roman Mars

We are project 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco and produced of the offices of

The vark sign Reggie Jackson of architecture firms in beautiful Downtown Oakland California

335
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
Between the beats

336
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,375
Bongs and Charter of our devices

337
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,959
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

338
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
If

339
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

340
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,479
Another

341
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
Technology talk to us

342
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
It is a creation of Sonic trash

343
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,391
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

344
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,975
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

345
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
To make them more human

346
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
Turn the living room lights on

347
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Okay

348
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
Dim the living room lights to 50

349
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
80%

350
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Okay

351
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:41,663
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

352
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,479
Makes for a much more natural experience

353
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Turn the living room lights on

354
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
Dim the living room lights to 50%

355
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:58,047
