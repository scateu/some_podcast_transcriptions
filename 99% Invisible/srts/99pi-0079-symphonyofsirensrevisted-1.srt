I'm Roman Mars

26
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
For the ancient Greeks

27
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:37,792
Sirens were mythical creatures who sang out to passing Sailors from rocks in the sea

28
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,352
The music was so beautiful it was said

29
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,656
It's Sailors were powerless against it

30
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,472
It would turn their ships towards the sea nymphs

31
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,776
And crashed into the reefs around

32
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,432
In Homer's Odyssey there's a story where Odysseus and his men are traveling near an area that Sirens are known to inhabit

33
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,504
Odysseus knows that if he hears the sirens song

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,296
This ship is going to sink

35
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,368
He still wants to hear what they sound like so he comes up with a plan

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
Odysseus has his men tie him to the mast

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,488
So that he can't take control of the ship

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
Then Odysseus has his men Fill Their Own ears with beeswax

39
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
So they can't hear anything

40
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,168
The plan works

41
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,984
Odysseus gets to hear the sirens call his men don't

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
And they sail on to safety

43
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
With Odysseus

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
Pleading with his crew to crash the boat

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
The whole way

46
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
And for over 2000 years or so

47
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
That's what a siren was

48
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,296
Preacher that made a beautiful sound

49
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
That all changed in 1890

50
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,952
French engineer named Charles Canada tour

51
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
Decided

52
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
Call the artificial noise maker he was working on

53
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
The siren

54
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
In this new mechanical siren became one of these signatures

55
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
Sounds of the modern world

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Sirens warned people about eminent bombing raids during war

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
Elise

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,344
Thanks in part to the siren the world of the early 20th century had become a lot louder than any time in human history

59
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,208
And we can probably assume that these aren't that people heard and said he's all over the world

60
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,280
Sounded nothing like the siren songs of Greek myth

61
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
At least to most people

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,656
One man that composer named Arsenio oblomov

63
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
Heard music

64
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,984
The cacophony of the modern world

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
Any try to create a composition

66
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
Symphony

67
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,640
The clatter of the newly-formed Soviet Union

68
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,992
In this little bit of a departure from the typical 99percentinvisible program

69
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,856
Maccabees producer Charles Maines investigated the legend of afremov

70
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
And is forgotten Master P

71
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,184
And then we're going to fall out

72
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,256
Popular classic 99percentinvisible about Soviet design

73
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
The first

74
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,352
This is the Symphony of sirens Revisited

75
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
November 1923 a man named Arsenio Brahma full climb onto a rooftop in Central Moscow you will be killed

76
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
2 Flags

77
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
The day will be November 7th

78
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,344
And the Soviet Union USSR will be celebrating its sixth anniversary

79
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,744
Birthday of the one and only portrait Revolution this man

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
A promise is a communist he's also composer music and they're on this roof near the Kremlin he will link the two

81
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,775
With what might sound like a strange idea you conduct the symphony made up an entire city

82
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,359
You call the symphony the Symphony of sirens

83
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,223
Let's be clear this isn't his first time

84
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
But it will be as most important attempt so far

85
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
So to speak

86
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:51,071
So this is what I know about a rhombus this is all I know and I know what I know from a different man the man I'm going to see

87
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Now

88
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:58,495
His name is Andre smirnov he is a man who studies these things a man who writes about these things

89
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
He is a man

90
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,591
You can answer with a clean now become our common questions

91
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
Or so I thought

92
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,647
Even said it was impossible to classify of Ramos

93
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,767
Family and it worked for the circus

94
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
He was a fountain of ideas

95
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
A ladies man

96
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
And if you couldn't depend on his personal life

97
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
Was even more so with this work

98
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
Can one testicle

99
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Composer

100
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
He was like

101
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Composer

102
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871

Lotus Thai

106
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
Like most people interested

107
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
Rover little about

108
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Because almost

109
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
None of it survived

110
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,415
So you could say there was two

111
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Display

112
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
His experiment

113
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
Videos ideas about

114
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Future of music

115
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
Music that was never written down

116
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Japan

117
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
The music

118
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Reply

119
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679

Planet

121
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
So what's that called what kind of music

122
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
The road or would have risen

123
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Give the music

124
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Survive

125
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
Well we just done now

126
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
So yes

127
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Music composer

128
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
But he's a

129
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Decomposer

130
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
Based on

00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,975
The missing part was based on a flair for the dramatic really on Heap nicknamed himself would have ours

Cinematographers

135
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,919
In the first Decades of the twentieth century they dreamed of ideas about the future with the arrival of the revolution

136
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:47,551
Remove any other set up to turn them into reality new art for a new world with support Seminole told me

137
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,855

Dewpider Ultra ski

140
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,607
He had very strong support from one high he had support from Trotsky

141
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,399
And as far as I know

142
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,983
Lenin supported him or at least he tolerated it all

143
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,127
Iterative is cultural Praises as part of creating this new future

Avant-garde

146
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479

About the future of our oceans

00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:30,047
Along the way of a developed far-reaching theories it would sketch out the concepts of electronic music biomechanics

150
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:36,447
For the use of sound and Cinema and then there was the Symphony of sirens

151
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:41,055
Aramis music of the future

152
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
The reason I come

153
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:00,767
Archival footage of parades in Red Square that they November 1923 showed clear skies

154
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
Cold fall day

155
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
What's the first time apparently the Kremlin

156
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
Helmsman airplane

157
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,031
Going to the tape I couldn't find any evidence of Rama

158
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
The irony

159
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
Smirnoff told me was that the pilot may have been the only one

160
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
Make sense of a Brahma

161
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
Liquor store

162
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
Performance

163
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
Because demonstrations were going on

164
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
The same time in Red Square

165
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
Airplanes were flying overhead

166
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
And most people probably

167
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
I didn't realize

168
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Siren

169
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
For their own

170
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Moscow zip code

171
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,031
But even for the people who are there

172
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,359
The song was so loud it blew them off their faith

173
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,271
Despicable Me 3 supposed to be in China, made in 2000 performance didn't understand those who were there

174
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Couldn't hear a thing

175
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,391
And nobody had even the slightest understanding

176
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
What bus going on

177
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
ILearn

178
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
One other detail that day

179
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,215
Although new recordings of the 1923 performance existed

180
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:19,615
A young composer in St Petersburg have staged around the symphony just a few years back

181
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:26,015
I bought a ticket and caught the first train out of town

182
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,167
Proposal

183
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,495
Replay the recording of the sirens to an unsuspecting public

184
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,591
Kiss Mark told me that Aramis believe every city had its own Symphony

185
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
Saint Petersburg

186
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,479
Constructed his version according to ramazan notes from the 1923 score

187
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:03,391
Kanye West

188
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,351
What does Symphony of sirens to detail description

189
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,959
So we can read it and hear what it might have sound like now heads

190
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,007
Hotels out of the water of Everett

191
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
Flintstone MD

192
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
The sirens

193
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
When the cannons

194
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,919
What should go off to watch Zuckerberg

195
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,295
Full filled out and breaking down clearly

196
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,599
And it's obvious why a gram of diesel

197
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,695
Sold at the symphony could you play Not only by music

198
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Additions

199
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
But by any person

200
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
New house

201
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,959
Kiss model splice together sounds beginning with a promise so-called megestrol

202
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,543
Set of steam whistles Sirens constructed to play the workers hymn

203
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,687
Any other revolutionary choirs and planes horns whistles

204
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Machine guns

205
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,271
More horns soldiers get the idea

206
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,647
Collectively they formed a sort of industrial hemp sovita chisme

207
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
City United

208
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
Audience performer

209
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Stage

210
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,559
And I promised telling the siren Call to work

211
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
Once sell oppressor

212
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
To become something

213
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
Celebrate in the workers state

214
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,823
It was the music of the future signal by the Cannons Roar

215
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:37,599
Sirens of Ramos Up on the Rooftop with a Flags telling the Cannons when to fire

216
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:47,071
3D ultrasound of absolute

217
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,735
It was loud his mode of conceited

218
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,087
And the sirens get the tourist

219
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:16,511
We continue to walk around pupil Fortress when unexpectedly we came across an exhibit for the American

220
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,047
Composer John Cage

221
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,447
Avant-garde artists could heard music in the sounds of the environment around him

222
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
My mind cage was around

223
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
Born a few years later

224
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
And with a different passport

225
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,455
The Coincidence was odd we enter

226
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
It doesn't move me she said

227
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,671
Innerview cages biggest defense was his most famous work

228
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,511
4 minutes and 33 seconds in which no notes are played for that duration

229
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,095
The song consists of whatever sounds around you at that moment

230
00:12:54,143 --> 00:13:00,287
Lasted 4 minutes before she gave up better they pay me a hundred

231
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:07,199
Suggested there might be other American composers more pleasing to her taste

232
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
No thank you she said

233
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,367
Not at that meant more of the likes of John Cage

234
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:23,327
The cages ideas weren't new I mentioned the Russian avant-garde explode the same ideas in the 20s

235
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
Idea

236
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Baku symphony of sirens

237
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
Something for every city

238
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
Who's this

239
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,455
Yes she said Petersburg sings

240
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,039
What city is the symphony

241
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,903
As if it was the most obvious thing she'd ever heard

242
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,751
Back in Moscow I found myself review in the archival tape

243
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
Red Square again

244
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
I still couldn't find a rama

245
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,735
But this time I was struck by something else

246
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
A simple idea really

247
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
You can never go back

248
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,511
Places on red square that they were full of excitement for new country

249
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
They were literally Boys on bicycles

250
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,607
But soon they would grow up

251
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Go to war

252
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
I couldn't help but think that many wouldn't return

253
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:40,127
November 1923 was the last time he would attempt his Symphony in Skyrim

254
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,527
He didn't fall victim to the Soviet repressions and he didn't die fighting the Nazis

255
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,647
According to Andre smirnov avant-garde they were just forgotten

256
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
Country grew up

257
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
And the wild Ambitions of the 19

258
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Twenties

259
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
Gateway to Soviet officialdom

260
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
Stagnation

261
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
And ultimately

262
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Cynicism

263
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
What she order

264
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
Smoothies

265
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
Estonia

266
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Truth adult

267
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
The problem isn't just

268
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
Majority of the public

269
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
It said they don't know the

270
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Directions work

271
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
Convince long ago that

272
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
The Soviet Union

273
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Producer

274
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
Set everything good was in the West

275
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Hanover

276
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Could do was make

277
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,839
Macbeth puppet Suburban

278
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
But it's not like that

279
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,423
And the history of

280
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,983
Bankers and Syracuse really proved it

281
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
Summer

282
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
But this song

283
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
She's having themselves looms large

284
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
That's how we were raised

285
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Hopefully

286
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
Someday it will change

287
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Quick

288
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
That night

289
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,895
Fireworks ring out over cities all across Russia

290
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
It was a holiday

291
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
I'd almost forgotten

292
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,319
Abramo stop music was the ultimate communal experience

293
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
And it was hard not to agree

294
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
Here we all were looking Skyward at the drums

295
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:34,559
But if I close my eyes and listen carefully I could hear a car lot

296
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
Steps on pavement

297
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
Laughter

298
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,959
But I mentioned other parts of the city chiming in

299
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
Crowds gathered in protests trains racing in the tunnels moskos never-ending traffic

300
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:54,015
Just the home in den of an average day in the city

301
00:16:54,271 --> 00:17:00,415
Didn't have to like about music of the future to know it was happening

302
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,815
If I couldn't find the man well it was comforting to know the music and never left

303
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,991
That was the Symphony of sirens Revisited by producer Charles me

304
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,879
That story was part of the global story project presented by PRX with support

305
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,927
The open Society Foundation

306
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:40,607
And that piece there was a mention of Soviet design and it brought them on this early episode of 99% invisible that I'm sure many of you haven't

307
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
So we thought we just tack it on here for fun

308
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
The question you have to ask yourself is this

309
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,823
Are you ready to bow down before the glory

310
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Acute hazard

311
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
This is 99% invisible

312
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,711
I'm Roman Mars

313
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:03,135
My friend Julia Barton that's me

314
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
Editor of

315
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
Made in Russia

316
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Samsung icon

317
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,839
What's the bed design in Florence apparent that sounds exactly like the building's door bus

318
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,263
No matter how hard we try cut out Lawrence

319
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
He denied

320
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:27,455
But maybe that's okay because I know if new book on Soviet design isn't the stuff of ordinary so

321
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,551
Soviet life cigarettes drinking glasses subway token machine

322
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
And it might be hard for Outsiders to see

323
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,487
What does seemingly random collection of Soviet consumer goods have in common

324
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,791
But I don't believe there's something that unites them all

325
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:46,911
Did you find this aesthetic you first need to realize that most of these items were

326
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,007
Rip offs of Western sources you know varying

327
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Qualities

328
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
They are imitation

329
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,639
By the way Lawrence the parent is imitating the door buzzer

330
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,015
Onelook the items in this book even though they are Shameless invitation

331
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
You'll see that the Soviet stuff is

332
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
Unmistakably

333
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
Soviet

334
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
Take your Soviet soda machine in those

335
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,975
Carbonated drinks came not in bottles

336
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
But straight into a communal drinking glass

337
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327
Something chained to the machine

338
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:20,703
In the excruciating Soviet arcade games were designed by the committee on amusement

339
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,823
Most Americans have any Mancini's artifacts but in a way we're responsible for them

340
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,383
Bass Crudo goes back to the kitchen debate

341
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:33,247
1959 the rooster Swaddlers successful American exhibit

342
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,087
In Moscow

343
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,607
Vice President Nixon showed Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev around the exhibit

344
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,191
We stopped in front of a model Suburban home to address an audience

345
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,751
Before New American color TV

346
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:00,127
There are some instances where you may be ahead of us in the

347
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,991
Development of your of the rest of your rockets for the investigation of outer space

348
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:09,087
There may be some instances for example color television

349
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:16,511
In order for both of us

350
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,655
My God I said that despite cruise ships wombat

351
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,447
Send the recent success of Sputnik

352
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
The Soviets were humiliated

353
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,543
Buy all of America's

354
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Stuff

355
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,383
Chris have decided the Soviet people needed stuff to

356
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,991
But with a huge struggle for the Communist Party to switch Soviet factories from producing

357
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
Tanks

358
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
10 Rockets

359
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Take a set.

360
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:44,927
Sex and hair dryers you know some party guy with the wood

361
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,487
Come back from a foreign trip and then

362
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,071
Bringing you know a German radio

363
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,167
And give it to the engineers make

364
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,823
And then they would just reverse-engineer at 2 and then they would look around for you know the guy who draws well

365
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,967
Can you draw the logo and that would be the logo that would last for the next

366
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
40 years

367
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,599
Assistant produce a lot of strange stuff but sometimes the Soviets did better than there is

368
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:20,256
Take the unbelievably cool magazine Krug azure

369
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,656
Kroger's or supposedly based on something cruise ships all while in the United States a magazine with a record in it

370
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,448
I don't call it the original podcast

371
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,776
Taxi South Lake public

372
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,712
There would be an article in the magazine and then

373
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Of the

374
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Contents of

375
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
Vinyl

376
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,064
This would somehow illustrate the art

377
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
Another would be

378
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
The sounds of the

379
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
The Foresters

380
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
Square or false

381
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
Songs of

382
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,536
Talk some far-flung tribe or is this

383
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,776
What started happening over time was

384
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,592
No sense the people who made this magazine

385
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,128
Had access to

386
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
But something

387
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:14,272
Unbelievably awesome for the Soviet Union which is you know vinyl of foot breast

388
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,112
They started slipping in a little pop music and there

389
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:24,768
It was the round tear out discs in Krogers or that gave Russians their first non bootleg recordings of everyone from Barbra Streisand

390
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
Send to Pink Floyd

391
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
Michael Jacks

392
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,936
The main thing that unites the designs and made in Russia is that they're often the only design

393
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,008
Micah light off didn't pick from shelf loads of sage

394
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Different kiss

395
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Sad recorder

396
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,360
Most Soviets had won the Vesna

397
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,688
The BK Electronica personal computer

398
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
Probably made Russian

399
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
Hackers

400
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
The best in the world

401
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
Through its sheer awfulness

402
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
Nobody had any other choice

403
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,928
Far be it from me to suggest that this is actually a good thing

404
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,976
But it certainly simplifies

405
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,048
Getting to know one another because

406
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,704
If you grew up in the Soviet Union and you know my age or older I already know so much about

407
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496

408
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264

409
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,824
Do you know if you grew up in the Soviet Union

410
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,384
It it's just seared into

411
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,432
I can I can sing it

412
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248

413
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,064

414
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Gross gif

Used skis

416
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:32,352
This scene from a children's puppet show aired every night at 8:15 on Soviet television

417
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,168
You can't really call the crude animal puppets

418
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,960
Icons of Soviet design

419
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,264

Making their own stuff in their own way

The tired toys are sleeping now

425
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
