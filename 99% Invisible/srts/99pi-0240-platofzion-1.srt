I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,648
Turning onto South Temple

24
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
Rose Place

25
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
It's just called South Temple

26
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
South Temple is in fact

27
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,608
Complete name of the street on which our producer Sam Greenspan is driving

28
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
Crossing

29
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
500 East

30
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:46,496
Exactly 660ft later Sam drives across the next major

31
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
Here's 400 East

32
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
And 660 feet after that

33
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
300 East

34
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:56,480
If you recognize the streets that Sam is calling off you already know exactly where he is

35
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
And what is about to say

36
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
200 East

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
And now here State Street

38
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Which

39
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,672
Seems to work like a 100 East

40
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
Wow there it is oh my gosh

41
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
That is the Mormon Temple

42
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,120
The Salt Lake Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

43
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
In Salt Lake City Utah

44
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
It's quite striking

45
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,472
It's beautiful

46
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
The urban grid of Salt Lake City Utah it's designed to tell you exactly where you are in relation to Temple Square

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
What are the holiest

48
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Sites for Mormon

49
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,760
I first learned about this when I was writing a letter to a friend in Salt Lake

50
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,576
Whose address was like 300 something south

51
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
2100 East

52
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,136
Salt Lake City UT

53
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,696
Which to me sounded less like us

54
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
House number and more like a set of coordinates

55
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,072
That's pretty much of every address Works in Salt Lake City

56
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
And in Utah generally

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
300 South

58
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
2100 East

59
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
3 block

60
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
South and 21 blocks

61
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
East of

62
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,128
Temple Square with the most striking thing about Salt Lake's grid to us non utahans is the scale

63
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
Each block

64
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Is 606

65
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
50 feet on each side

66
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,528
That means you're walking more than two football field

67
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
Dogs to get from one intersection to the next

68
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,392
Salt Lake's blocks of a biggest in the country

69
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,488
You can fit nine Portland Oregon blocks inside one of Salt Lake City

70
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,048
These giant blocks of created some challenges

71
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
For the city of song

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,144
But they were all part of the original plan for the city

73
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,472
One created by its Mormon Founders a century-and-a-half

74
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
Alphago

75
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
In an effort to create

76
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
Spiritual Utopia

77
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
In the desert

78
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,432
Every city plan begins as someone's Utopia

79
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,504
Urban planners imagine the way their City ought to be

80
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,344
Make some drawings and then watch as that Vision becomes reality

81
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,720
Throughout most of human civilization urban planners imagine their cities arising from a system

82
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
Streets joining at right angle

83
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
A grid

84
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
The idea of a grid goes back at least

85
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,888
To 2600 BC

86
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
In the Indus Valley

87
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
In what is now Pakistan and Northwest in

88
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
We know this from archaeological find

89
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
Ancient Egypt had grid

90
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,104
Ancient Babylonia head grid

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
The Greeks and the Romans had dreads

92
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
Any cities in Europe don't have a grid

93
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,808
But when European settlers came to North America they mostly build Gridiron City

94
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:13,440
When Joseph Smith founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the religion of the Mormons

95
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,512
First conceived of a holy city for his new religion

96
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,559
He would not have had much experience

97
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
With large

98
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
Urban grid

99
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
Was born in New England and then when he was young his family live to Upstate New York he never would have saw a city that

100
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,847
Add more than a couple of thousand residents

101
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,639
This is dr. Benjamin Park

102
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:39,039
My name is Benjamin Park I'm an assistant professor of American religious history at Sam Houston State

103
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:45,439
Pace University dr. Park says that Joseph Smith's foray into urban planning began with a document called

104
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
The Platte

105
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
Zion Zion

106
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
Was a

107
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Map

108
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,143
Details all the way down to how big the

109
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
Housing plots would be

110
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,727
How many Rosewood

111
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,383
Fit into the city where the courthouse would be where the temples will be how many people

112
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,479
Will live within these boundaries to plan which Mormons believe came to their profit

113
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,831
The Joseph Smith part and parcel with a series of Revelations that led him to found

114
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

115
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,207
A plan which would Inspire the Mormons eventually

116
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
Spiritual home

117
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255
In the Salt Lake Valley

118
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,863
Have you been in the Temple Square before yesterday

119
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
Pepsi some of the sites

120
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,471
So we don't have to point out which is the Tabernacle which is the temple

121
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
Feel free to

122
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
Fix the radio

123
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,103

I can go on for 3 weeks about Temple Square took Sam to the LDS Church History Museum

128
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,023
Reply to self

129
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,047
Is over here

130
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
This is it

131
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Is it the original

132
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
This is

133
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
What they

134
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,751
Described and named the plat of Zion

135
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
The three of us are gathered around it

136
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,199
Display case in the museum that's actually pretty easy to just walk right past actually think the display case here under States

137
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
The significance of what's in it

138
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
It's just a rough-hewn

139
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,343
You know it's designed to look like a rough-hewn wood box

140
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Inside

141
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
Thunderstick Museum glass

142
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
Is a large piece of parchment

143
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
Was Joseph Smith's Urban plan

144
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,535
American city of God

145
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,095
The temple blocks in the middle are kind of this

146
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
Ochre kind of red color

147
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
And the streets are labeled in a kind of light gray

148
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
The document were all looking

149
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
The plat of Zion

150
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Is a city

151
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,151
A series of squares divided up by horizontal and vertical line

152
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
It is one of the

153
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
First documents

154
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
That the Mormon prophet Joseph

155
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
Smith and his scribes

156
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,063
It's a pretty simple system

157
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Very large block

158
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
660 ft on each side

159
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,695
All forming right angles with one another

160
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
All of them the same

161
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279
Except for these special blocks in the middle

162
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,839
Which he imagined would hold 24 Temple

163
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,447
The city's grid was designed so that you would always know exactly how far you were

164
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
Phoenix Spiritual Center

165
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
ICD definitely is divinely

166
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
As far as these are coming from

167
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
A man who

168
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
Had never seen a big city who would probably never heard of

169
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Planning

170
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
And

171
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
Was really

172
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,807
Looking at this is the basis of Revelation

173
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,367
Understand how the kingdom of God looks

174
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
When it hits the Earth

175
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
This is ionic City that Joseph

176
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
Smith imagine

177
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,815
Would be as big as New York or Philadelphia or Boston worth

178
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,655
Eugene attempt to harness the best thing the city could offer

179
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Infrastructure

180
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
Haitian community

181
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,263
But without the less Savory bit

182
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
Like bison

183
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,871
Crime Joseph Smith saw to achieve this by giving people

184
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
Lots of space

185
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,991
It would effectively be a rural City within the large blocks each

186
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,575
Church member would have a plot of land to have fruit trees in vegetable garden

187
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,671
And Joseph Smith imagine the essential piece of the urban fabric

188
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Would be the home

189
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Again

190
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
Dr. Benjamin Park

191
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,047
I think he would have rejected the

192
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,143
The general separation of a commercial and domestic level

193
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,703
You'd go to shop that's based out of someone's home

194
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,287
But Smith never got to experience his mixed-use

195
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:16,127
Walkable everything artistically crafted Utopian community

196
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,479
After leading his Converse to Ohio and then Missouri and then Illinois

197
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,063
Clashing violently with locals pretty much everywhere they went

198
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
Joseph Smith was

199
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,415
Killed by an angry anti-mormon mob

200
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
In 1840

201
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,791
The leadership of the LDS church fell to a member of Smith's Inner Circle

202
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,375
A man named Brigham Young

203
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
A large number of the church

204
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,727
Outwest to what was then Mexican territory

205
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
After a journey spanning years

206
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,359
The Mormons entered the Salt Lake Valley in 1847

207
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
And established Salt Lake

208
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,735
It would be the first place that they could build exactly as they want it

209
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,063
And when Brigham Young began devising a plan for what they would build

210
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
He returned to Joseph Smith

211
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Bottoms on

212
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,511
Brigham Young's plan does look a bit like Joseph Smith's plat of Zion

213
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
But with more detail

214
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
And some changes

215
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887
I see this utopian idea

216
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,215
Hitting some problems when you have to start dealing with actual landscape

217
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
That's Emily at again

218
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
With the LDS

219
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
Church Brigham Young realized quickly

220
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,663
Zion wouldn't work in the real world without some modification

221
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
Miss Plan called for

222
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
24 temples at

223
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
At the center of the city

224
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
Young decided to start with

225
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
1

226
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:33,439
Brigham Young also realized that the city couldn't survive on cottage industries alone

227
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,511
They would also need some commercial and Industrial.

228
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,583
There were limits to the rural City idea

229
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,447
In the mountainous terrain of the Salt Lake Valley didn't lend itself to a regular rigid grid

230
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,055
What is anyways Brigham Young's plan for Salt Lake City is faithful to the plot of Scion

231
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,871
The city is still after all built around a temple

232
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
And with streets

233
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,967
Name a way to tell you exactly how far you are from

234
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
At all time

235
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
And the orderliness of

236
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
The grid DuckTales with Mormon sensibilities

237
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
About the spiritual importance

238
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
Of maintaining

239
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Heidi home

240
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,999
Brigham Young and his fellow Mormons did not stop with Salt Lake City

241
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,327
Over the next half-century they built about 700 lb

242
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
Based on a similar plan

243
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
All over Utah

244
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
Ended many of these town

245
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,751
They kept Joseph Smith prescription for large city block

246
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
660 ft on each side

247
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
With y Street

248
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
The joke is he could turn a wagon around

249
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:30,271
In the middle of the block actually one version of the joke I heard is that the streets are wide enough to be able to

250
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
Saturn wagon around

251
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,903
Without the drivers resorting to cursing

252
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,303
In Salt Lake City the wide streets in huge blocks have the effect of making you feel kind of small

253
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
And they say that everything is bigger in Texas

254
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
Just don't think those people have been to Utah

255
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
Before this is Molly O'Neill Robinson

256
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
Urban designer for the Salt Lake City

257
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Government

258
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
We're walking around downtown Salt Lake

259
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,407
And she showing me just how hostile these wide streets

260
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
Can feel the best

261
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
We are crossing the street

262
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:05,599
Right now we're crossing 4th South also known as 400 South so we are given at 27 seconds

263
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
A 130

264
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,023
Right away the blinking pedestrian sign gives us less than half a minute to cross

265
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
Six Lanes of traffic

266
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Normal pace

267
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,679
Many if not most

268
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Send Salt Lake

269
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Even Street

270
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
In the heart of downtown

271
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,311
Are four or six Lanes wide

272
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,359
All because the plot of Zion

273
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
Called for streets

274
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
With the Wind

275
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
Of 130

276
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
Back in the day

277
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,295
Things were plotted and measured using

278
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
The

279
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
Surveyor's chain

280
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
Surveyor's chain

281
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Also known as one furlong

282
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
The width of our street is

283
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
2 furlongs hours

284
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
32 ft

285
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:49,887
The streets are so menacing to cross the city tried making them safer by offering pedestrians

286
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
Bright orange

287
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
Flags visible lamp posts

288
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
There is a

289
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Bucket of

290
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
To it

291
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
And I dislike once

292
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
4 5 6 7

293
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
Freepik

294
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,527
You're supposed to pick up a flag and carry the flag with you as you cross the street

295
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
For added visibility

296
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
We we should

297
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
And I'm going to make you do it

298
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
Embarrassed

299
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
No

300
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
I refuse to carry a flag

301
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
All right through Crossing now I'm waving this flag

302
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,679
I've seen these Crossing Flags in other places my neighborhood actually has them

303
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
At the intersection near the elementary school

304
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,799
But it doesn't kind of absurd to ask people

305
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:32,895
Ulta carry bright orange Flags in the downtown of a large American city

306
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Veracross

307
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
So you refuse to carry these

308
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
So I refuse to carry the flag

309
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,135
And that I believe that our streets should be designed

310
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
To inherently make pedestrian Crossing

311
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Safe

312
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
And

313
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
If you have to carry a flag

314
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
Across the street

315
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
To get someone to notice

316
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Then we haven't designed

317
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,471
And difficulty crossing the street is not the only problem with lard

318
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Roblox

319
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,543
Urban planners have long known that short block

320
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
Rocks are inherently more interesting

321
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
Because there's a greater density

322
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,407
What they call Network notes

323
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
Or sites of possible interaction between

324
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
Shorter blocks me more intersex

325
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
And more intersection

326
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
Show me more options for

327
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
What to do or where to go

328
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,719
Given the problems at large blocks and white streets are created in Salt Lake

329
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,327
You might get the idea that Salt Lake's Founders just started out with a bad plan

330
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
Not at all

331
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,191
Oh know what you're seeing there is a complete misunderstanding

332
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,495
Brigham Young's Concepcion

333
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
That's Andre stuani

334
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
A partner with the Architecture Firm

335
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Dpz

336
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,431
He's also one of the founders of the New urbanist Movement

337
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:44,319
Which seeks to make cities and suburbs less car-oriented more walkable and more environmentally friendly

338
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,903
Andres duany says that in Brigham Young's original plan

339
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,487
The streets were never supposed to be paved from Curb to curb

340
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
The streets

341
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,303
We're basically a green space

342
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
With pavement only in the parts

343
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,143
We're settlers wanted the oxcart to

344
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,959
And Brigham Young never imagined that the huge block

345
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
Box originally meant for farming

346
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Would remain intact

347
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
Is the city of all

348
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
You understood

349
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:10,175
Did the blocks would have to be subdivided from agricultural to Urban

350
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Overtime

351
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:17,599
Ford Juanita Salt Lake City we have today represent the stagnation of Brigham Young's dream

352
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
He went from most beautiful

353
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
Most hostile in the West

354
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,535
And definition understanding of the intention

355
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
A Brigham Young

356
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
And the plot of Zion

357
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
Making the city less hostile to pedestrians is exactly what anti orange flag Molly O'Neill Robinson is

358
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
Is trying to do

359
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
She wants to take those huge blocks

360
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
Break them down into more walkable sections

361
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
And make them more interesting

362
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,015
You know that there's something kind of engaging and delighting

363
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Your eyes room

364
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,879
Molly is hoping to do this block by Block in Salt Lake City

365
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
She took Sam to one current

366
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Tekton regions

367
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,791
Where they're working on getting more pedestrian life into the middle of the block

368
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
So

369
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Regent Street

370
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
Is really

371
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
The first

372
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
Christian first

373
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Street

374
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
In Salt Lake

375
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
Pizza Street the street has always been here

376
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,663
Yes Regent Street used to just be an access road for some Downtown parking

377
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,759
Now it's a pedestrian walkway that opens up into a Plaza

378
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
The brand new theater

379
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
A new restaurant

380
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,879
The idea with the street is that we will be able to

381
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
How to close down pores

382
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
7th Street 4

383
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
Festivals

384
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Events

385
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,327
Vic theater opening things like that

386
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,167
As of the time of this recording Regent Street is still under construction

387
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
But even so

388
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
People are already drawn to walk through it

389
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,407
The stakes for creating a denser more walkable Salt Lake or high

390
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
Even though the city

391
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,759
Feels wide open and nature is easily accessible

392
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,087
Salt Lake suffers from some of the worst air pollution index

393
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,695
Country the mountain ranges around the city trap in all the smog which largely comes

394
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,559
Cars with more Salt Lake is expected to double in population by 2050

395
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
And it can expand its city limits

396
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
Because of geographic boundaries

397
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Like mountain

398
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
Great big salty lake

399
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
The city's ability to thrive will be determined by its

400
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,591
Its ability to make more efficient use of the space

401
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
It already has

402
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
There's a lot of optimism in the city

403
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
For finding better ways to

404
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
To use its large block

405
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
White streets

406
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,039
And there's been some progress

407
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:28,671
But several developers told me that the new city Administration has not been kind to bees

408
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,743
Approaches they seem to be more about keeping Salt Lake City

409
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
As it is

410
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
In the Church of Latter-day Saints

411
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
There's a principle called continuous revelation

412
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
The God is still speaking

413
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,263
And that Divine truths are still being revealed

414
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,567
So maybe with Salt Lake City needs

415
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Maybe with all American cities name

416
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,663
Is it kind of continuous revelation

417
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,503
A way of honoring the principles on which the city was founded

418
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
But with the understanding that they must adapt

419
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,343
And respond

420
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367

Oakland California

435
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:01,087
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

436
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,671
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

437
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
If

438
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:12,095
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

439
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
Technology talk to us

440
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
It is a creation of Sonic trash

441
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,103

443

To make them more human

444
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
Turn the living room lights on

445
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Okay

446
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
Dim the living room lights to 50%

447
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Okay

448
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:45,119
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

449
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,191
Makes for a much more natural experience

450
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
Turn the living room lights on

451
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,335

I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

477
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:54,143
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of

478
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:01,567
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop
