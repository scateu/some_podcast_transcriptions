Harley-Davidson famously tried to trademark the sound of their motorcycles that Potato potato potato sound

55

Play Kim Possible to trademark but Tyler and Joel say it was crucial to building up the brand It's associated with

64
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,584
Oh man I know that sound I know it's so well

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,680
When I was just a little kid on a cul-de-sac they build a Chili's in my town

66
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,848
This was before they were really chain restaurants where I lived so Chili's actually felt kind of Novel and exotic

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
My family was pumped

68
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
My favorite thing to order

69
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
If I he does

70
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
They don't

71
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,088
Really sell the steak they sell the sizzle

72
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:10,976
In their book Joel and Tyler use Chili's and their sizzling fajitas as an opening example to illustrate why

73
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,536
Companies should think more about sound

74
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,864
You're sitting in the Chili's at the dinner hour at 5

75
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
And let's say it first nobody's ordering the sizzling fajitas

76
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
But then

77
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,568
Maybe about 20 minutes 30 minutes into the dinner hour and and I've seen this

78
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,176
All of a sudden one person order sizzling fajitas

79
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,784
As the server brings out the sizzling Skillet of fajita meat and onions

80
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,416
And you hear that sizzling sound literally every I every single person in that restaurant

81
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Their head

82
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
Turns to the server

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,584
Walking past them and they follow that server with their eyes

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
And then they smell

85
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,936
The burnt onions in apple and now you're hooked

86
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,496
And now everyone orders the sizzling fajitas

87
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
And in the back instead of making that one order they make 15

88
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
Yeah they called the fajita effect

89
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,176
My family fell victim to the fajita effect

90
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
Too many times to remember

91
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,552
We may even have initiated the original fajita effect

92
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,368
Patient zero of the fajita effect

93
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,512
Chuy's by the way did not invent that distinction goes to a Texan by the name of Sonny Falcone

94
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,607
He was selling a subpar cut of meat called the Faja in figured that

95
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:26,495
If you cooked it out in the open with law spice people didn't care about the quality of meat

96
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,359
It got to Chili's because Larry Levine was the founder of Chili's

97
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,711
Had seen restaurants around the Rio Grande Valley so they do their version of it

98
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,087
He had the idea to make sound the star of the show and so when Chili's opened up

99
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,487
They put that sound of sizzling fajitas in their first ever commercial fajitas sold like crazy

100
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,095
In the wake of their massive success Chili's printed up T-shirts for staff but said

101
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,167
I survived the summer of fajita Madness

102
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
Now they

103
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,055
They serve enough fajita meat to fill to nuclear submarines a year

104
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,895
I really hope someone feel to nuclear submarines of fajita meat to get that measurement

105
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:14,111
It's surprisingly difficult to get people even really creative people

106
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
To think about sound

107
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,231
To Value it in the same way they value the visual environment

108
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,535
But sometimes there's one person who gets it

109
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,631
An Apple computer is one of those people with a guy by the name of Jim reekes

110
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
Hi

111
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
My name is Jim reekes

112
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,495
I'm the only person you know whose name is it

113
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Complete sentence

114
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,383
Jim Norton Apple for about 10 years starting in the late 80s

115
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Titles

116
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
I don't even think I had business card

117
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
But whatever his title was

118
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,343
Jim was working on sound for the Macintosh computers

119
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,903
Which was neglected stepchild of

120
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:53,791
All things Mac no one really cared about the sound until the end which is unfortunately typical

121
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
Exception

122
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:00,447
He's a composer and a musician and he understood the importance of sound more than most of his colleagues

123
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
And Jim have

124
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,079
Strong feelings about the startup sound that was on the Mac at the time

125
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
I just hated it I could not stand it

126
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
Here's what it sounded like

127
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,271
Here is a couple more times cuz it goes by really fast

128
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
So when Apple

129
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,159
First start it up it was

130
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Makino

131
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
The computer is far from perfect

132
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
They crashed a lot

133
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,863
And every time you turned it back on you heard that jolting sound

134
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,167
So Jim set out to make a better one

135
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
Mac just crashed

136
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Again

137
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
Your work

138
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
Again

139
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,895
You're waiting for this thing to boo'd up

140
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
Again

141
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,223
That's

142
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
The Odyssey

143
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,927
Just a bunch of pissed-off frustrated people are super annoyed and you're wasting their time that's a hard audience place

144
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,743
I got to change everyone's mood

145
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
So I was thinking

146
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
Zen like

147
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
Meditative

148
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Sound

149
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,775
Similar to a gong or chanting ohm

150
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:14,431
Of course we're all familiar with the sound he came up with

151
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
Oh that's nice

152
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
So much better right

153
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,367
Only problem was Jim ask for permission to put this new sound into the Prototype

154
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
For the new Mac and

155
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
I was

156
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:30,815
Tell him I couldn't do it we already have a sound you're not allowed to change it was just on and on and on

157
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,911
But Jim knew the people who were responsible for building the Prototype

158
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
I played it for them and then

159
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
They liked it and so

160
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
When no one was around

161
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:46,431
We put her into the build and the Quadra 700 shipped with the sound in it

162
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,271
That was back in 1991 when the Quadra 700 Mac cost

163
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
$1,000

164
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
Jim says he never got any props for the sound

165
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Just grief

166
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
And yet that sound with a few minor tweaks

167
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,279
Husband the Apple startup sound ever since

168
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,839
So I think we can assume that Steve Jobs liked it

169
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
It's his big giant

170
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Two handed

171
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,471
C chord c major chord that makes you kind of

172
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
Feel welcome

173
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,311
To this very stable very

174
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
Substantial world of Apple

175
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,687
It's probably the single most

176
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
Connected

177
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
Sound with the Apple brand

178
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,063
And brand is just the experience

179
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Or

180
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
Apperception

181
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
Prior to

182
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
The expiry

183
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
So

184
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
Everything that shapes the

185
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Perception matters

186
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,887
Lbnl like imagine a really beautiful car

187
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,239
That just had this horrible engine always backfire

188
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,919
Actually there are people who make sure that beautiful cars sound beautiful

189
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
Or at least they sound right

190
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,295
One of them is Sean Carney

191
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
Hi my name's Sean Carney

192
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,159
Mustang powertrain sound quality engineer

193
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,463
John works on Mustangs

194
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,535
And there are all kinds of things he and his team can tweak

195
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,935
To get the sound they're looking for

196
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:17,567
Inner tubes have different shapes and different perforation synonyms of the whole pattern Venom

197
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,711
Kind of like you can control the sound of a horn by placing your fingers over different holes

198
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,783
Chongqing control the sound of the Mustang

199
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,367
And it's an easier job for the standard V8

200
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,951
But then sometimes they'll put out a specialty Mustang

201
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:40,863
In 2008 Mustang decided to put out a remake of a Mustang that appeared in the movie Bullet in 1968

202
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:47,519
In the movie is a pretty famous Chase sequence where Steve McQueen drives his Mustang all over the Streets of San Francisco

203
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,015
Show me the team wanted to make the 2008 Bullitt sound similar to the 1968 Bullitt

204
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:04,415
Dora come see a car like a bullet it's about in his car the whole movie

205
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,511
Strong you back into those old memories

206
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,095
If I was like that for 4

207
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
Yamoto band

208
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,215
They're trying essentially to make a new car sound old

209
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:22,591
Which is challenging because cars made in 1968 or built completely differently

210
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,943
Battle of the carburetor and we use a fuel injection for Thurman

211
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,503
Play all the things

212
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
Completely change

213
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
How the engine confirmed

214
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:38,975
Sean was never going to be able to duplicate the sound of the Bullitt car from the movie exactly

215
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,327
Sing in the movie was enhanced with sounds recorded from a race car and apart from that

216
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,911
It's actually illegal in most places to drive around in a car that loud

217
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,727
A big part of what we try to do is

218
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
Which better identify

219
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:56,127
What are those key characteristics of being played

220
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,431
By that classic American

221
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
V8

222
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:04,575
I found the tent in the movie came out people talk

223
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
About the sound

224
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,927
And most people thought Sean and his team have gotten it right

225
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
Here's the 2008

226
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
Bullitt Mustang in action

227
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
Sound is

228
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Actually

229
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
In front of all of our senses

230
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
It's the one we react to quickest

231
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
Even quicker than touch

232
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
That's Joel Beckerman again

233
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,759
Brands that are not paying attention to this

234
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,343
Not paying attention to sound in association with experiences

235
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
They're really going to get punished

236
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Case in point

237
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:46,047
In 2010 Frito-Lay decided to come out with a new biodegradable SunChips bag

238
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,143
Only problem was they never considered what that packaging sound

239
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,215
Here's a YouTube video someone made about the bag

240
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
Delicious

241
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Sentence level

242
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:02,687
Things that I cannot get over is the noise that this bag make I don't know what it's made

243
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
If you ever want to

244
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,415
Do you want to get one chip out of this bag

245
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
Good luck

246
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,303
Mega on YouTube was not the only person to notice how noisy the bag was

247
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
Someone created a Facebook page

248
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,679
Called sorry I can't hear you over this SunChips bag

249
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
And I got 40000 likes

250
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
And it became a national news story

251
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,847
Bad to pull the new back and go back to the old bag

252
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
Good intentions bad execution

253
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,223
John Tyler refer to this kind of sound as a Sonic

254
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,527
Trash you know you never let somebody to

255
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
Take a note take a bunch of trash and throw in your front lawn

256
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
But we allow

257
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Cities

258
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Our neighbors

259
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
Brands

260
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,559
To really invade our Sonic space it dump garbage in your ear

261
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:59,007
Joel and Tyler imagine a world where all the sounds we hear have more thought behind them

262
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
More intention

263
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:05,151
It would be very rare that you would actually hear the sound that something made

264
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,223
That thing would trigger a better sound

265
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:13,087
In Tyler's World they can make the SunChips bag sound like this when it's opened

266
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,903
Every time you get a chip you're like

267
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
Love ya I said that sound it's actually on that very short list of trademarks

268
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
So hands off

269
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
Whatever

270

There is a button on my Tombstone and you can press it and it would play the sound

276

But taking away the fake

301
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,575
Human and adding and some thoughtful sound
