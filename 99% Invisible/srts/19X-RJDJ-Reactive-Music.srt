Slightly Theses shifted double length director's cut of episode number three

33
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,600
The story is about how a new technology in this case

00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,952
The smartphone in the rjdj Adaptive music app

36
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
Change the very nature of Music itself

37
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:50,752

00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
So

39
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288

San Francisco it doesn't years ago I stopped over in LA to visit my friend Max

41
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,296
And as he drove me around the Hollywood Hills the song screenwriter's Blues

42
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,112
Buy soul coughing came on the car stereo

43
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:11,488
Twisted like knots on the finger that seem to sync up

44
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,304
With everything in the world at that Mom

45
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
When the turn signal was flipped on

46
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,400
It always kept the beat

47
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,472
Headlights whizz by in concert with the bass flute

48
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,872
And the storm would Crescendo just as a new amazing Vista presented itself to the windshield

49
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,272
And you are with the name

If you have the Walkman generation

51
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
But the iPod generation

52
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,928
Or if you take a lot of drugs

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
You've probably had this happen to you

54
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,584
And Michael Brian bruker is a big fan of the sort of musical serendipity

55
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,168
That's for me was worse always very magical moments

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,984
That's one of the reasons he created rjdj

57
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
A musical iPhone app that tries to give you that

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Feeling

59
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,104
Every time you put on your headphones

60

We are you know combining the world around you with your listening experience

61
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
So you know

62
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,344
The door closes and something really amazing acoustically could happen

63
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
Denim I'm always feeling like

64
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
I'm more in the in the movie

65
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,303
But basically take the movie away and put your life into it

66
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,095
And that talk to you too

67
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,655
Robert Thomas is one of our jdjs composer

Changes in Valatie

72
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
Into what you're doing

73
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,455
Rjdj is comprised of saints which are analogous to song

74
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,015
But they're more like instructions for songs

75
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Tabata music

76
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,111
Kodi iPhone Zone built in synthesizer

77
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
Audio filters

78
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
And these are triggered by the user

79
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
According to the composers

80
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,255
Planned for the sea

81
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559
Coolest Quantum composing

82
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,119
Think of all these different possible ways that they

83
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
I'm listen to you

84
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,239
Come up with lots of different ways that that will

85
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
Create something very interesting

86
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Music

87
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
When the

88
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
Sound

89
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,967
Coming in from the field surrounding this is very loud because I place a really fine as kind of gun

90
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
Dudududu dudududu dudududu

91
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Making a video

92
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
And when the

93
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391
Sound of your surroundings he's pretty quiet

94
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,207
You could have ready simple kind of drones

95
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
Just make it really kind of

96
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
Quietsource am

97
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
You can have

98
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,983
All kinds of past changes in the music based on

99
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
Analysis of that behavior

100
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:38,431
Change the song but so does the accelerometer in the phone

101
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,783
Time spent listening to be a factor and even GPS data can be incorporated

102
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,391
It all these stimuli work in concert to create an augmented reality

103
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951
Which is the kind of mind-blowing thing money

104
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
The way I see is it

105
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,863
It kind of feels like you're seeing some in a beauty and everything

106
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
And I think that's why

107
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
Weather really great scene

108
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,983
The people that made so far already what

109
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
Did the most famous One

110
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
Call Monica

111
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Real estate

112
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:18,367
Add my wife may put in the patented white earbuds and check out one of the scenes for the first time

113
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
This one's called the orgasm

114
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
Tricare number

115
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
Do do do-do-do-do

116
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:34,239
It's what I steel girder would hear up a steel girder could hear

117
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:41,407
Kind of like being in a horror movie but not quite horrible

118
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
I know it definitely has a horror movie soundtrack body like something bad is coming but you haven't hit this

119
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:54,207
You know yet but now we have cookies

120
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,559
The most users report that the eargasm scene makes them hear the beauty in all things

121
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:03,167
An environment where my wife is listening she said It felt more like a horror movie

122
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,983
And that's kind of rjdj in a nutshell

123
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:12,639
It's almost as if we have been in the silent movie before and and now you're you're all of a sudden in the

124
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
In the movie that has the soundtrack

125
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
Possibilities are endless

126
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:21,599
If someone made The Bourne Identity Chase music into an endless reactive music scene

127
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
I swear

128
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,695
There is nothing the CIA could do to stop

129
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
Yeah you heard me Panetta

130
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,399
But the makers of rjdj aren't content simply changing your perception of reality

131
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,215
They're really looking to change music itself

132
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
To understand this wave

133
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
Consequences of

134
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
This advancement

135
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Tea

136
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
Composition of music

137
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
Thank you kind of have to

138
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,455
Look at it over readyyy time scale

139
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
Antenna

140
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,039
And if I had some severe zakat music with something that

141
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
I guess pass between people

142
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,439
And it's a song was heard and replayed by someone else it changed

143
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Constantly

144
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
Relatively weak

145
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,767
We've invented

146
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Notation

147
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
Tries to record what that is

148
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
What piece of me

149
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
In some kind

150
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
Motif

151
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
And very recently

152
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
We got used to the idea that

153
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,567
Music can be recorded

154
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Unfrozen in

155
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
To some form

156
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
Conceptual object

157
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
And the object

158
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
ICD

159
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
2 vinyl

160
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
A type of

161
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,343
An MP3 that Wilkins

162
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
And at this

163
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,023
Point a single version of a song that's like a performance of a song became

164
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
But song

165
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
And those thousands of years of mutability

166
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Ended

167
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,959
But the technology of rjdj puts an end to that

168
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,031
The studio is actually inside

169
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
The iPhone

170
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
Manassas actually watch it

171
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Tjs videos

172
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
Studio inside the knife

173
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
When

174
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
That happens when

175
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
Set delivery point

176
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Music

177
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
It's actually a studio itself

178
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Something very much

179
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Because

180
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
It means that

181
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,743
That mixed and that way freezing music

182
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Kantime

183
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Recording

184
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
It's no longer really necessary

185
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
It means that you can have

186
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
Multiple pops

187
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Simple ways of a

188
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
Experiencing a piece of meat

189
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
So it's kind of like

190
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
Worlds of music

191
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:22,175
The promise of rjdj is an unparalleled musical synchronicity with your surroundings

192
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:26,015
Rather than putting on a set of headphones to block out the rest of the world

193
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
Rjdj listeners.

194
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,207
Plug into a constantly changing unique soundscape that connects them to what they're doing and where they are in the world

195
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
I imagine

196
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
Walking around San Francisco

197
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,119
Listening to a mashed-up composition of punk and Hip-Hop

198
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,447
It gives me a history of the neighborhood I'm traveling through

199
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,567
And the GPS will trigger a sound clip from Alfred Hitchcock's vertigo when I pass through Nob Hill

200
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
Do I need to do spells this week

201
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
I'm having one right now

202
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,247
Music

203
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,319
In the tempo of speed up as I

204
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,975
Scary out of the way of an obnoxious bike messenger into the path of an unnoticed oncoming cable car

205
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,303
My sudden lack of all movement as I

206
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Lion the pavement while listening

207
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
Using a harmonica

208
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
Drone from the iPhone earbuds

209
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
Which one makes beautiful

210
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
The Sirens from the paramedics

211
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
As they approached

212
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Stop

213
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
Or you can choose your own adventure

214
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,831
Unless it's over this week I hope you enjoyed it

215
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:39,743
18 to the coming weeks because I have lots of stories from me as well as stories from some of the best radio producers in the world who

216
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
What happened to me

217
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,887
Friends of mine which is Rockin that they're doing pieces for 99percentinvisible I'm so happy about that

218
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
So stay tuned for that

219
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,727
And spread the word you guys have been so great

220
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
So Twitter and

221
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
Login Facebook and joined up on Facebook and unlike it on Facebook I would really appreciate

222
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Appreciate it

223
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:02,527
I'm still trying to get funding for the back half the year so everything you can do

224
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575
Spread the word helps us out

225
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,855
Alright thanks so much

226
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Ticket

227
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:29,151
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

228
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
The body genius is a dark

229
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
Comic mystery

230
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,295
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

231
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
We're looking the part

232
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
Might cost you your life

233
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:43,743
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

234
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:48,095
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

235
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:52,447
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

236
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,799
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

237
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:03,199
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of thing if you

238
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:08,831
Days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

239
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:15,231
Was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

240
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:21,631
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it now I need to

241
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
To clear my name

242
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:29,311
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

243
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:38,271
Final episode of the body genius drops on May 30th Bend all 5 Parts on the truth podcast. Com
