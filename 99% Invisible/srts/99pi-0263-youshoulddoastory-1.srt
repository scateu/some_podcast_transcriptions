I'm Roman Mars

28
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,536
Do you know I was talking to John Marr he's the guy who first sputtered this Bedrock 99 Pi mantra

29
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
Always read the plaque

30
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,632
We were talking about the show and he said you know what you should do a story about

31
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,192
It's one of my favorite places in San Francisco

32
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,240
So I went to the address when I checked it out

33
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
I kid you not

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,056
He sent me to a gas station

35
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,360
On Van Ness Avenue in San Francisco

36
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,688
He told me to look around and discover what was weird about

37
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,528
In almost every respect is that normal Chevron gas

38
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,576
It has a blue awning

39
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,880
And the red and blue Chevron logo on the side

40
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
But

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,696
The sign and Awning don't say

42
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
Chevron

43
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
Standard

44
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,144
As in standard oil a massive oil Monopoly broken up in the early 20th century by the Sherman Antitrust Act

45
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,960
When the independent companies created by that break up

46
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
Was Chevron

47
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
And for some reason

48
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Even though

49
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,848
This gas station is a modern Chevron station in every way

50
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
It's called

51
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
Standard

52
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:31,296
Did you call the Station they will answer the phone saying Chevron and the attendant cannot tell you why it's a standard on the side

53
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
But trademark

54
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
Like Amanda levendowski

55
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
Can't

56
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
Trademark can be any

57
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
Word names

58
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
Device used by someone who has

59
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,352
Bona fide intent to use the mark in Commerce

60
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,912
And are using that word symbol device

61
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Hugh

62
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,472
Identify the source of their goods

63
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
That phrase bona fide intent

64
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,336
Means that you want to keep a trademark

65
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
You have to use it

66
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
In this particular case

67
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,456
When General oil was busted at

68
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
Standard Oil trademark

69
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
Still retain a lot of

70
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Goodwill in value

71
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,696
And if for whatever reason down the line Chevron wants to take advantage of that value

72
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
The name standard

73
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Has to be used

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,584
And I have to be used in connection with whatever the underlying

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
Goods or services are so

76
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
They couldn't dress

77
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Prince

78
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
Templates

79
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,336
Occasionally used mix Chevron standard branding and say that they were still using it for oil and gas

80
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:31,200
Matthew prominently use the standard name in conjunction with oil and gas services

81
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
If they want to keep

82
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,784
So that's why there's a standard gas station

83
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,112
All intents and purposes operates as a Chevron station

84
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,696
In San Francisco and 15 other locations in the US

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
This week

86
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
You should do a story

87
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:51,680
We're researching and presenting short design stories requested by our listeners and seen where that path takes

88
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
And in the spirit of the exercise

89
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,104
We're starting with what I think is the most requested design topic of all time

90
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
Here's our digital director Kurt Kolstad

91
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
I thought you with me

92
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
About

93
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Desire path

94
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,880
As the name suggests desire paths are these unplanned routes people just really want to take

95
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
And their sheep by repeated use

96
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,744
And I think part of it is that they're found

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
Everywhere you can just see them all over the place

98
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
And the most common type of UC

99
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Are short

100
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,423
Which are often just visible as

101
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
Ruffner Trails through you know grassy areas

102
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
Is insidious

103
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,567
The most commonly when you think of Desire path you think I would like

104
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
Imagine like

105
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,687
A circuitous or maybe like a 90-degree turn on a sidewalk

106
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,991
And then there's this like 45 degree

107
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Dirt path

108
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
That cuts across

109
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
And create a shortcut and that's

110
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,391
The most common idea what it's Sour Patch

111
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
This is people want to take the shortest path but

112
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
Desert pets are not always

113
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,303
Back sometimes they end up being a long cut

114
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,143
And this can happen for all kinds of reasons in some places

115
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,215
There superstitions about walking under utility pools

116
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,567
And some people end up taking his long way around and you can see that box in the dirt

117
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,127
Or like when there's like

118
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,991
A slope going down to a to a crossover underneath the road

119
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,831
And normally in a biker with bike down that hill and then bike back up the other side

120
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,415
But often there's like a way to just you know take the grass

121
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
And go off to the side

122
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
Indians of being a longer path

123
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
But I want to go up and down hill

124
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
So it's like a shortcut in the center

125
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:31,007
Energy it'll still take them less work ultimately but it also is just kind of weird because it blows out to

126
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
Besides

127
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,711
So this can be really frustrating as an urban planner because a lot of reason

128
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:45,343
You designed things the way you do is that use the built environment to shape the behavior you want

129
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
But

130
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,927
Deserve us can also be eliminating because

131
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,535
They can really show a designer how to make their design work better for people

132
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:59,423
Right sometimes they frustrate the plans of urban planners in trailmakers but other times these people can actually

133
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Evaluate

134
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
The behaviors that people have naturally

135
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,823
And use that to inform their designs

136
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,383
So for example college campuses have been known

137
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,455
To map out a basic grid of sidewalks

138
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,855
But then leave some sidewalks unpaved and just sort of see where people walk to fill in the gaps and then they

139
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
They come back in and they pee fat

140
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,463
Based on the natural behavior of those people walking

141
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
And in Finland

142
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
Park Winters have been known to

143
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,679
Watch and see where people walk after a big snowfall so there should be a blank slate

144
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
And people cross the park

145
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,847
And they just trace the pause then use that to inform a year-round pathway for that

146
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,687
Which I see reminds me of my favorite form of

147
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Snow base

148
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
Desire path the snake down

149
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
Which is a portmanteau

150
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,415
Snowy and neck. Which is kind of hard to picture it's like a

151
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
Part of the car but you can imagine like a straight

152
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Street

153
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,559
And then like a little bit of a bump out of the curb in extension of the

154
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
Drug is called a neck down

155
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,911
So how did the people use a snake down

156
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,007
So like those finished Park planners that are evaluating

157
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
Where people walk after snow falls

158
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
Urban planners can use

159
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,175
Smackdown to evaluate workers drive after a snowfall

160
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,991
And more specifically they can look at where they don't

161
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
So when the fresh snow

162
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,855
Covers the road drivers in the following there or pass

163
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,719
And then other cars follow in that narrow path which leads a lot of area actually untouched

164
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,839
And this results in what is effectively like a temporary curb extension

165
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,911
And can also form for the traffic islands in the middle of streets

166
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
Where cars just don't go

167
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:41,567
But didn't did they ever take this information and like use it for other parts the year when it isn't snowing

168
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
That's really the key is

169
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,687
Erlanger's can evaluate where people don't go

170
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
And use that information

171
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:53,087
Advocate for curb extensions and traffic islands where they don't it currently exist

172
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
And the argue is pretty straightforward I mean if the cars

173
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
Don't need to go there in the winter

174
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,767
Why do they need to go there at all right

175
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,839
PetSmart I like it it because you look a little

176
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,911
Sandbox to plan once the snow falls and all the sudden

177
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,519
You realize that you can have this opportunity to replaying your city and these two little tiny waist

178
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,079
Oh wow this analysis is really kind of lovely it's

179
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:19,967
Like people go out and they take pictures living videos and then they trace over these places where the cars don't go and suddenly

180
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
It was very clear the cars

181
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
Actually need that

182
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
1 reasons why desire paths

183
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
Since I found her soap that resonates so much with

184
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
Awnings and not because they're urban planners

185
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,279
It's because there's this great metaphor for design in general

186
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
Yes and a lot of people use them

187
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
And usability design and think about them

188
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
In terms of

189
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Interface design

190
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
So

191
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,519
A really common tactic is to not just

192
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,615
You decide we're going to make this thing this way and people going to use it this way

193
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,455
But instead to actually look at how people are already using something

194
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,271
And then take that and get it a more official way to work

195
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,855
The word example on Twitter you know apps and hashtags

196
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
Who's built in with Twitter

197
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
Users of all those

198
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Overtime

199
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023
And then put her images that o

200
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,375
Well if user using them we're going to support this usage and you know evolve

201
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
I never really thought about that at Saint

202
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,751
Hashtags for basically desire path created by the user

203
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Digital desire

204
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,895
You want to take a deeper dive into the hash mark

205
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
Four octave work is a

206
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
For the calling

207
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,015
Average of Mendenhall episode about its Origins

208
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
Turn your hymnals

209
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
New episode number 145 you will fight

210
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,791
Ministry suggestions we get come through Twitter someone

211
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Twitter login

212
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,119
And we'd a lot from emails to but this suggestion

213
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
Came to senior producer Katie Mingle

214
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
In person

215
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,847
Yeah so this was after our recent live show that we did in La a fan came up to me

216
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,151
And he was like nice job

217
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,223
Also I've story idea for you

218
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,623
Ugly it on me and he start telling me about it and it was like about electrical current clock

219
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,183
What's the time in Southern California win

220
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,047
Switch I I don't know I didn't absorb that much of it at the time

221
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,703
What did you tell me it did kind of sound like a bar alley so I went back I started looking into it and

222
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
Basically the story starts back

223
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
In the late 1800s

224
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:25,407
The Los Angeles area and through surrounding the other towns in Southern California

225
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
We're starting to get there first

226
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,527
Power plants in the main motivation at the time

227
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,599
Listen to bring Refrigeration to the Citrus Growers

228
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
So they can play

229
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Oranges inside

230
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Refrigerators

231
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Exactly for cold Orange

232
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
Of course

233
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
And so back in these early days

234
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:46,143
List of electricity there wasn't a national standard for like what frequency of

235
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
Current these power plants should deliver us

236
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
What is an Alexa

237
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
Really mean and then what are the option

238
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Do you have to work

239
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
I'm still at school

240
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,455
Now the part of the show her I explain electricity

241
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,063
No I don't want to actually do the complete the service of

242
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,391
Talking too much about the physics of electricity but

243
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,559
The way I understand it is at electricity basically comes into our homes in waves of alternating current

244
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,119
And you can actually think of them like pulses

245
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
And the number of

246
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,215
Pulses per second is the frequency of the current

247
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,311
So if you're on a 50 Cycle System or like a 50 hertz

248
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
System

249
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,943
The pulses are coming at 52nd and then 60 hertz would be

250
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
60 second

251
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,039
I'm 50 and 60 are sort of the two most

252
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Common

253
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Frequencies

254
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,111
And why would you use one like

255
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,327
They're both fine they both do all the things we need them to do and you can deliver current at lots of different

256
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
Frequencies

257
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,935
But if you slow it down enough likes a 2:30 Hertz

258
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,495
When you screw in a lightbulb

259
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
You apparently

260
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,335
Can actually perceive a sort of

261
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
Stop pulsing in it

262
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
Service perceived as like a flicker

263
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Inverter

264
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
In the light bulb

265
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,087
So in the early 1900s Southern California so Lake Los Angeles Burbank Pasadena

266
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,903
They all start from getting on the 650 Hertz

267
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
System

268
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,767
And meanwhile the rest of the country is getting on a 60 hertz

269
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
For the most part and there's like

270
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Some exceptions

271
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,911
Right in civil right now that's not that big a deal in the early 90s

272
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,727
But eventually this greatest. Going to all meet up

273
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Would not be

274
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,943
Right I'm so it starts to become a problem and one of the things that becomes a problem is like manufacturer

275
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,039
Had to make different products for people in Southern California

276
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,695
Because anything with like an electrical motor that was designed to work on a 60 Cycle System is not going

277
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
To work as well

278
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
50 Cycles

279
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
System

280
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,375
And one of the things that definitely didn't work as well was Electra

281
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Clocks

282
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:01,055
So if you had a clock that you got a New York City and then you moved to LA and you plug in your clock

283
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,615
It would actually lose 10 minutes

284
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Every hour

285
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Yeah

286
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
And that is because

287
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
Electric clock

288
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
Actually use those

289
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
Pulses of current

290
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
Keep track of the time you know some clocks

291
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
Have pendulums but

292
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
Keeping track of those

293
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
Pulses of current is it is the way that electric

294
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
Clocks know what

295
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Time it is

296
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
Or when to move

297
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,655
And at that point electric clocks were really popular like a lot of

298
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
People have them they're not

299
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
Common anymore

300
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,775
3:00 swear problem other things with motors

301
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,103
And then in the thirties California started to receive

302
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,687
Power from new dams like the Hoover Dam

303
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,527
And this power was coming into California at the wrong

304
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,575
And then the power companies with

305
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
Convert it

306
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,439
And the conversion process was difficult and expensive

307
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,303
So in 1936 the city of Los Angeles decided to

308
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Switch all there

309
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,631
Customers to 60 Cycle

310
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,447
Current and then in 1945

311
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,775
The Southern California Edison Company decided to switch

312
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,335
Everyone else in Southern California

313
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
Over to the the sick

314
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
Dixie cycle

315
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,967
And that must be crazy because you're talking about every Appliance

316
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Plugs into

317
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
The wall

318
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
He's now like being running

319
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
Suboptimal

320
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
Frequency

321
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
And therefore you have to change everything

322
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:27,327
Yeah it was nuts it was a huge undertaking like they weren't just like okay sorry like throw out your stuff

323
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
They sent

324
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:33,471
Cruise into people's homes to retrofit their washing machines

325
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,031
They sent people into factories

326
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,103
To make sure all the Machinery worked right

327
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
And it was

328
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
Hundreds of thousands of

329
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
Customers like I think nearly a million

330
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Customers

331
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:48,831
Spend another power companies also had to change all their own equipment all the electric meters

332
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623
And then

333
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,719
Four clocks you could actually go and drop your clock off at it

334
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
At 7 call the clock Depot

335
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,607
And there were just like rows and rows and tables of

336
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,703
Clocks being worked on and serve men sitting there working

337
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
To make your clock work

338
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,823
Riddles is like

339
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
You have this big

340
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
Such a project and then everyone just got to work and made it work for everybody

341
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Quite a few

342
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,343
So by 1948 all of Southern California has

343
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Switched

344
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
To the new system and the final

345
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
Tally was like 500000 clock

346
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,279
Almost 400,000 lighting fixtures

347
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,839
58000 refrigerators

348
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
And if you think of

349
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
How the population of LA

350
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983
Exploded in the following years it's

351
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
It's so lucky

352
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,615
That they decided to take this on when they did

353
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
I mean you can possibly do it now

354
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,039
No like no way and that's sort of why you'll never see like

355
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,575
International

356
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,879
Standard for electrical current

357
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,231
So you'd be may know if you've traveled to Europe that you have to buy like a little adapter

358
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
Cuz most of Europe is

359
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,559
Still on A50 psychosis

360
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
And they'll never change cuz it would just be

361
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,983
I was just be too much I think the United States and Mexico

362
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
Chicago and most of like

363
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,335
Central America maybe South America or R6

364
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
Cycle

365
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:21,759
And Japan is actually I think the only country that still uses two different frequencies

366
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
In there one country

367
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
So basically one half of the country has

368
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
50 hertz

369
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Send the other half

370
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Is using 60 hertz

371
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
Open MySpace

372
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:35,583
Yeah it actually like was a really big problem after the Fukushima at

373
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,703
Accident because a big portion of the country lost power there was a tsunami

374
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,567
They were trying to send power from one part of the country to the other which is

375
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Fairly common thing that

376
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
You know we do

377
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,967
But they couldn't do it you can

378
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
Convert

379
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,807
From one frequency to another but it's hard to do it

380
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
In really big

381
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Quantities

382
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,975
And sold every so often in Japan actually there will be this little movement that bubbles up that's

383
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,303
Like we should all be on the same frequency and then

384
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,935
It just like really quickly dies because like once I was like well we're not going to switch

385
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,031
Every Other Side Cycle where is definitely not going to switch either

386
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
And that's the end of that

387
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
What stays the same

388
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
So it's

389
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
Say the same and yeah we

390
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
Can think of those early

391
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,295
Pioneers in La that were like let's go ahead and do this before Things Are

392
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Control

393
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Thanks

394
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
Those guys

395
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,695
And thanks to Jake in it

396
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Yeah I think

397
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
PJ Cannon

398
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,071
And you talked to a couple other people that you want to say

399
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,215
Talk to a horologist named Ken Randall for the story I thought the story was actually going to be more about clocks

400
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,543
Send it ended up being so Island

401
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,615
Anyway she was great

402
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,991
I asked him if he'd heard a sound he said no of course I immediately sent him a link

403
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,319
And then I also talked to an electrical engineer named Darrell Heinrich

404
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
Who is also really

405
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
Really helpful

406
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,799
Longtime crew clothes that has been obsessed with

407
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,103
European style tilt and turn windows

408
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,175
Really ever since he was a kid living in viroid Germany

409
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,759
I can't really explain them in audio with a really functional and

410
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,551
Worthy of his design obsession

411
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,111
What about them recently on the website

412
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,439
And several readers shared and appreciated his design session

413
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,231
And to some they were completely new

414
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:44,351
And there was a bunch of Europeans were just confused because they didn't understand that these windows weren't already everywhere

415
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:49,471
Half the readers were astonished these things exist and wanted to have them and the other half

416
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:54,591
Shocked that anybody would think they were shocking because they were totally ordinary everyday window design

417
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,919
So this web article prompted a bunch of our audience

418
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:02,015
It's to send in suggestions for other clever Regional design Solutions

419
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,807
That we should also do a story about

420
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
What are the things that

421
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,135
Somebody suggested right off the bat

422
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,439
Which I was instantly fascinated by

423
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
Are these things called

424
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,023
Finnish dish drying closet

425
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,583
They're also known as dish drying cap

426
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
Okay tell me the truth

427
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
It's osteon

428
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
Cuy

429
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
Valve

430
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Scopy

431
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
Xian Cuevas comp

432
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
That's what it's called that's what it's called

433
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,127
Asean cruise by icamp

434
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
Okay so go ahead

435
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
So the design has a pretty simple premise

436
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
If dishes can drive themselves and Storage

437
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
There's no need to drive a manual

438
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,671
So instead of having a drying rack next to sink

439
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,999
You put your dishes away in the cabinet above the sink

440
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,071
And this cabinet has special shelves with slots

441
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,119
The waterfalls down through each level

442
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,191
And it lands ultimately in the sink or on a sloped surface

443
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Richland Transit

444
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,287
And of a nicer of

445
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
Design by product

446
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,151
This end up cleaning up clutter in your kitchen so you don't have this

447
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,991
You know just drying rack is always half-full dishes sitting next to sink

448
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,551
So your dis Trainwreck is essentially the same cabin

449
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,367
You put your dishes away in exactly the one step process

450
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,159
You just get out of take the dishes

451
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,951
Put them away they drive themselves

452
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
I love it

453
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
It's so beautifully simple

454
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
They should do that

455
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
We should have those everywhere

456
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
So this Regional design match

457
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
It was suggested by

458
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
By Anton

459
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,703
Now that he lives abroad

460
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,239
Anton says

461
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,775
I have to dry my dishes

462
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
Anorak

463
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,823
That's it from the counter

464
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
Biker bar bear

465
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,943
Truant on I agree with you

466
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
We are Barbarian

467
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,551
So you wrote an article about that when it was a huge hit

468
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,367
And then it cause people to send in other little Regional

469
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,671
And suddenly I had a lot of

470
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,719
Regional design Solutions work with

471
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
And one of the first ones that

472
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,559
Came out was this could Tatsu table

473
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,375
Which is a Japanese burnishing that doubles as a heating

474
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,959
Show picture of really tall coffee table with

475
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
A quilt

476
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263
Over the sides that you

477
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
Put your legs on

478
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,359
And I underneath the tables there's a small space heater

479
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:09,759
Endless top layer of the table it's a large picture but just like two two two panels sandwich this blanket so you

480
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,319
You have a service that you can set things on but you also have

481
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,391
Is blanket or comforter extending out on all sides

482
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,232
Instead of sitting around in an arc facing a fireplace

483
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
You can actually sit around in a circle

484
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,840
And face each other and pull up sections of this cover

485
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,168
And then to interact around this this Central Heating

486
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
Why is this a Japanese thing

487
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,080
Historically been really useful in Japan specifically because

488
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,640
Home insulation is often sparse

489
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,200
And whole house heating can be difficult and expensive

490
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:44,576
And then traditional Japanese clothing also lends itself especially well to this form of space Heating

491
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:49,184
Because warm air can flow up to the folds of a spacious kimono and then out

492
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
The neck and arm holes

493
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512
I mean that's what I like about it is

494
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,840
It has a lot of very specific reasons that it comes out of Japan

495
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,936
But a lot of those aren't necessary to add function either

496
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,240
A lot of those things would work for a really unique place

497
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
With the way that it's optimized for a kimono suggests that

498
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
It didn't used to be

499
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
Electric heating oil

500
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:15,296
No historically they came from a food cooking system that was in the floor so they have these charcoal burning

501
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,112
Who took hers in the floor and this morphed into a system

502
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:22,976
Where they would try to use that to keep the home that eventually in on the modern era

503
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
The certiport dangerous

504
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,328
ConEd fire solution was replaced by an electric

505
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Local heating system

506
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,888
Cool one of those

507
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
Kotatsu table

508
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,800
These would be great everywhere as long as they burn your legs is there any incidents

509
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
Did you hear about anything about

510
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,408
Advisories

511
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
The daylight don't fall asleep under your couch

512
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,504
2 table legs

513
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:52,160
Lead to injuries and things are perfect

514
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,976
Sleep under tables in general probably

515
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
So it's really important to use

516
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
Table as described

517
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
But that is not like our next

518
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,240
Design solution was one of its powers is

519
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
The versatility

520
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
Of this on

521
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
It's called The Hills

522
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,896
The hills hoist is effectively

523
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,736
The opposite use case it can be used for everything

524
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,272
That is not designed for

525
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,952
Basically it's a rotating clothesline they have a central metal pole that sticks up from the ground like the trunk of a tree

526
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
The smaller clothesline Sports

527
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
The branch out from the top

528
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,304
And then this thing sits

529
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,144
Awesome backyards and it's been slowly Breeze drying clothes on a series of lion

530
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,192
That just a circle that

531
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
Central Pool

532
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
And where is the healthways

533
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,568
Hills hoist was developed in Australia

534
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
And

535
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,128
Pioneered by this guy

536
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
In the 1940s was coming back from the war

537
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,992
I decided to basically build his own backyard

538
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
Rotary close

539
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,088
It wasn't the first of its kind but his really took off

540
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
Commercial success

541
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,416
Now that company sells millions of

542
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
The things

543
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,744
This is not just a thing for drying clothes

544
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
Backyard like this

545
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,072
Is become and iconic designs

546
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
Really tied to

547
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
Australia

548
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,168
Yeah it one of our listeners wrote In

549
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
The really great

550
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,288
Very detailed explanation of its role in Australian culture

551
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
And basically

552
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
As she explains it

553
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
It's

554
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,200
This kind of critical fixture of the Suburban Australian dream

555
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,736
When you get this quarter acre lot with

556
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,760
Beautiful backyard

557
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,064
In your beautiful backyard you have the seals

558
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,112
Is any sort of an incomplete picture

559
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
Without that

560
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
Iconic thing

561
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,744
But unlike the single-use case of the Finnish cabinet

562
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
Or even though

563
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792

Pictures of hills hoist being used

566
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,472
Things that kids hang on and spin around and

567
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,592
Pinatas or whatever like anything that you can hang something and want to spend it

568
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
The hills voices

569
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
The perfect solution

570
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,432
Yeah it didn't

571
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,480
There's a great YouTube video that out there

572
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,016
Of these guys who

573
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
Hooked up

574
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Lines the thing

575
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:02,208
And a motor and have it spinning super-fast in like they're whipping kids around on a on a water slide on the ground

576
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:06,304
And if there's like a wedding or holiday party you decorate your Hills hoist

577
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,864
There's a drinking game where people hang bags

578
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,168
Wine from the thing and spend those around

579
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,240
Emily kind of one of these I kind of love about it is that

580
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,032
Like every stage of your life

581
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,640
There is some activity that you do whether you're a kid

582
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
Who's swinging on the thing

583
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,248
Or somebody is much older and sitting in the shade

584
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
You put on top of the thing

585
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
Everybody has

586
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,624
Some use for that

587
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:36,256
Righto if you combine the ubiquity of this object with boredom of sitting in your backyard

588
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,816
You will get some kind of creative solution

589
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:45,216
Or something yeah yeah yeah yeah I think it's this big thing and it's a knitted vert

590
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,032
Into inevitably people figure out new things to do with it

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

664
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:17,952
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

665

Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

Even worse

674
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,440
The cops think that I had something to do with it

675
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
Now

676
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
