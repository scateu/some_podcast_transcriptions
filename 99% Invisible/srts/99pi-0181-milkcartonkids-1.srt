I'm Roman Mars

36
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,232
The story we're about to tell is pretty much the worst

37
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,768
A parent can imagine

38
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,120
We were awakened by the phone ringing

39
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
That's Noreen Gosch

40
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,472
It was early on a Sunday morning in 1982

41
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
In Des Moines Iowa

42
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,824
Marine son Johnny had left for his regular paper route

43
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,152
It was a neighbor saying they did not receive their newspapers

44
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
This wasn't like Johnny

45
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
Even a paper boy for years

46
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
He never missed a delivery

47
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:03,648
His dad got up and said I'll go help him finish the route he's probably just running late

48
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
He went

49
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,000
The street and that's where he saw Johnny's wagon sitting

50
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,816
Johnny's Red Wagon was sitting at the corner

51
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,400
It was still full of newspapers he rushed back and told me

52
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
Johnny was gone

53
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Call the police

54
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
Johnny Gosch was 13 when he disappeared

55
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,104
He had blue eyes and dirty blonde hair

56
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
The small gap between his front teeth

57
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:31,296
And his would be the first face of a missing child ever printed on a milk carton

58
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,392
It's been 30 years since these milk cartons came and went

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,000
I wasn't alive to see them but I still know about the faces on the milk carton

60
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
That's reporter Annie Brown

61
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,632
The image of a missing child on a milk carton became iconic

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,704
A kind of cultural shorthand for missing children

63
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,544
And even though this image has stuck around for three decades

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,872
The actual milk carton campaign only lasted 2 years

65
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,712
It was largely unsuccessful at locating the kids on the carton

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,880
Good morning that Johnny disappeared Doreen said it took 45 minutes for the police to arrive

67
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,208
So he called around the other boys who deliver papers that morning

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,816
She found five witnesses that saw her son talking to a man in a Blue Van

69
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
She relate this to the police

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,936
The cop looked at me and said will has your son ever run away before

71
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,520
And I said well now he's never run away ever

72
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
Nor did he run away today

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,616
But the police were skeptical

74
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
This was Iowa

75
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,480
This kind of thing wasn't supposed to happen to kids like Johnny

76
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,016
In places like Iowa

77
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
Would never had a crime like this

78
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,880
This was before Amber Alert

79
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,696
Before those text messages that you get when a kid goes missing

80
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,512
It wasn't even a category for missing children

81
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,840
Kids were put in the same group as missing adults

82
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,936
In an adult have to be gone for three days before they were considered missing

83
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,544
Without the police's help Johnny's parents tried everything they could on their own

84
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,384
They hired private investigators in coordinated search parties

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
Meanwhile as a search

86
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:07,552
They also wrote Iowa State legislation that would differentiate missing children from missing adult

87
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,600
I wrote the Johnny Gosch law

88
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
Camping kitchen table

89
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
But after all of this

90
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
Noreen Gosch is sun was still gone

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,375
And then two years later in 1984 another little boy disappeared while delivering newspapers

92
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,191
He lived in a neighborhood not far from Johnny's

93
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
Morning

94
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,879
The second Paperboy had a relative who works at a local Dairy the Anderson and Erickson Dairy

95
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,487
The relative in the dairies owner has an idea to help by Newsboys

96
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,071
Anderson Erickson Dairy contacted each family

97
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
And they wanted to do something

98
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
Helpful in the investigation

99
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,727
The families of the missing boy the greed

100
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:02,079
And within a few short weeks thousands of milk cartons were rolls out of truck

101
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
An inter grocery stores

102
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,943
As clerk stock their shelves

103
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,783
The faces of Johnny Gosch and Eugene Martin smiled back

104
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
The campaign started out at 1 local Dairy

105
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,439
But over the next few weeks it spread to other Midwestern towns

106
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
In Illinois there I saw it and said hey

107
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
Why don't we try that

108
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
And from there

109
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
It went National

110
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
Nearly everybody drinks milk Mill turns over quickly so we could put a lot of different kids photos on

111
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,335
Run and pull children's off that needed to come off at a moment's notice

112
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
That's Barbara huggett

113
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
She was working as an artist

114
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,967
At the national Child Safety Council in Michigan

115
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
When the national milk carton campaign took off

116
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,831
Our founder apparently he'd seen

117
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:49,439
Johnny Gosch and Eugene Martin on the Anderson Erickson dairy milk cartons

118
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,511
But he felt that the program should be Nationwide

119
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:58,911
A nationwide milk carton campaign Willard families in California to look for a child who went missing in Iowa

120
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:05,567
The national campaign brought together local groups looking for missing children and together they came up with a list of

121
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
77kids

122
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
From all over the country

123
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,223
We used cases that were believed to be

124
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,807
What they termed in those days dangerous stranger abductions

125
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,391
In other words kids that weren't taken by someone they knew

126
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,207
Farbstein didn't have computers

127
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,279
So they cut and arranged all 77 layout

128
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,679
By hand design to lay out there was just doing a rather simple

129
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,239
Did across the top of each waxy paper panel

130
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:40,639
Photos of two children were laid side-by-side in black and white

131
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
Height weight

132
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,807
They also printed the pictures on school milk cartons but only one child could fit on those

133
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,927
Barbri started Ares all over the country asking if they'd be a part of the campaign

134
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:59,327
Within months 700 independent dairies had signed on boys I wish I knew how many cartons

135
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
Had circulated

136
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,263
Imagine its way into the billions 700-750 Dairies

137
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
Printing in and day out for years some sources of estimated that as many as five

138
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,503
Five billion milk cartons for printed with the faces of missing children

139
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
200 missing children were featured on milk cartons as part of the campaign led by the national Child Safety Council

140
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
Two were found alive

141
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
One with a kid named Bobby Smith Jr

142
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,351
Barb still remembers when she got the call about Bobby

143
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,399
After we gotten the word

144
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
That the child had been found

145
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
It was just a sense of

146
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,567
Of elation and you wanted to let everyone in the building that

147
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
Had mailed it box

148
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
Good chip dip

149
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
You know you just wanted to tell everyone who had

150
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
That

151
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
Did that was worthwhile

152
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,319
You could hear the cheer throughout the whole building

153
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
Yes we found a child that was wonderful you know

154
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,743
But Bobby Smith wasn't found because of the milk

155
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,303
Bobby was found by coincidence

156
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,375
His kidnappers car had been involved in an accident

157
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,447
And when the police came looking for the owner of the car

158
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
They found Bobby

159
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:16,383
The other child found alive with a girl named Cheryl Lynn Kramer but most of the kids featured in the national campaign

160
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
And and in the smaller local ones

161
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
We're never found

162
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:25,343
Unfortunately the leads from the milk cartons did not reveal or Johnny's look

163
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Location was

164
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
That's Noreen Gosch again

165
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:34,815
Her son Johnny was never found but Barbara huggett and Noreen Gosch are both adamant

166
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
The campaign had a positive impact

167
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
What it did was promote more awareness

168
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
So the people were looking

169
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
They saw a child that look like they were into

170
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Stress

171
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Maybe you could

172
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
Whether or not

173
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
Those were the parents

174
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
During the milk carton campaign

175
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,271
The missing children assistance Act was passed

176
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,343
It established a Federal program to find missing kids

177
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,647
Changing the rules for

178
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,719
Children when they're missing not having to wait

179
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,023
The hours and in days

180
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,887
And mostly the milk cartons just got people thinking about kidnapping

181
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,703
That this could happen to your kid

182
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
I have talked

183
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
To quite a number of adult

184
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,335
And they could remember their mom putting the milk

185
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
Carlton on the guitar

186
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Table

187
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
I'm saying

188
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Now

189
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
We're going to go over the rules in

190
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,015
And they would use the example of the boys on the milk

191
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:31,647
And make the correlation between that child and their child's life

192
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:37,023
In other words the faces on the milk cartons scared the hell out of everyone

193
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,119
Which ultimately led to the campaign's downfall

194
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:47,263
Almost as quickly as it began the milk carton campaign started by the national Child Safety Council ended

195
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
Just two years after the first milk cartons were printed

196
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,663
Dairies began to pull the missing kids pictures from their side panels

197
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:59,551
One reason of course with the carton says that the industry shifted to plastic

198
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,647
But there is also started to get tired of the depressing message

199
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,207
Took it away because there were people that were

200
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,279
Complaining that they thought it might scare children at the breakfast

201
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
The famous pediatrician

202
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
Dr. Benjamin Spock

203
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Rope columns

204
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
Condemning the milk carton campaign

205
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
Is traumatizing he said

206
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
Kids shouldn't have to face that over there Lucky Charms

207
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,151
They see these missing kids kind of staring at them

208
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,967
That milk carton almost demands them

209
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
To have that conversation

210
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
What to do if you see a stranger

211
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
Worst Ranger cost you

212
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
Let's Palmer Ziggy Renfro he's a historian at the University of Iowa

213
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
On the Milk Carton Kids

214
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,071
And their effect on us

215
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:48,959
He believes the milk carton campaign reflected a larger fear that was gripping Society at the time

216
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
Stranger danger

217
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,335
Paul studies the way that child safety was talked about at this time

218
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
In the news on the radio by politician

219
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,967
He says that the sphere

220
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
Stranger danger was exploding

221
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,111
Folks are taking around these numbers that are just astronomical

222
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,207
Picture saying there 1.8 million missing children in the United States

223
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:15,839
Missing becomes very closely attached to abducted by strangers

224
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
But that just wasn't true

225
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
Every year

226
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,519
800000 kids are reported missing to the authorities

227
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,591
That's around 2000 every day

228
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
But a report from the Department of Justice

229
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,503
Found that the number of kids taken by strangers every year

230
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
Is only about a hundred and fifteen

231
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
The milk carton campaign led by the national Child Safety Council focused on kids who were kidnapped by

232
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Strangers

233
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,279
And they were criticized for this

234
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:51,167
But they were also smaller more localized campaigns going on that were Bound by this rule

235
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,823
It was one of these smaller campaigns that ended up featuring the face of a missing girl named Bonnie Lohman

236
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,639
Cannot my strangers I was kidnapped by people that loves me

237
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:05,247
Bonnie Lohman was kidnapped by her mother when she was three

238
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
After her parents got divorced

239
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,159
Even though she wasn't kidnapped by a stranger Bonnie that had managed to get her on a milk carton

240
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,487
Funny had no idea that she had been kidnapped

241
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
But her childhood was pretty strange

242
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
After taking Bonnie

243
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,887
Her mom and stepdad went to Saipan

244
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,519
A tiny Island near Guam

245
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
After year in Saipan next was Hawaii

246
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
But they were still lying very well

247
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
We stayed inside all the time and

248
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
I recall Maybe

249
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,783
One or two times being outside

250
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,831
Finally they ended up in Colorado

251
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,159
Her mom and stepdad started to relax a bit

252
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
The next-door neighbors had a bunch of kids and

253
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,023
Bonnie played at their house all the time

254
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,327
Will you play Barbies and I had my little

255
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,887
Barbie case and I would bring that over

256
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,007
Aside from going to her neighbors Bonnie was hardly ever allowed to leave the house

257
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,103
But on an unusual occasion her stepdad took her to the supermarket

258
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
They needed milk

259
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Just remember like looking and

260
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Seeing how many

261
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
Part of the milk there were

262
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,319
Like nowadays it's like whatever brand it is would be facing

263
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
He knew where I was at that

264
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Pictures were

265
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
He grabbed the milk

266
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,743
Irritating after that is

267
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Hey arthena

268
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
And I saw myself and I was like

269
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,119
That means like

270
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Yes

271
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
Bonnie actually saw her own face

272
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
On a milk carton

273
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,311
Though she had no idea what it meant at the time

274
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,359
Funny step dad bought the milk carton

275
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
And when they finished it

276
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
He asked her do you want it

277
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
You you want to keep it

278
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,343
Until I remember cutting it out and being like Willow and staring at the picture

279
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
My hair was leaking a little

280
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,439
Ponytail on the side and I was wearing this little

281
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,535
Dressy like now you got to keep it in a safe place and I must have tossed

282
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Barbie case

283
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,607
Looking Back Now

284
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,679
Bonnie sees her step dad's actions as arrogance

285
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,239
He was so confident in himself

286
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
Could show me that because nothing's going to happen

287
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,431
But the next time Bonnie was at the neighbors house she left her Barbie case

288
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
Is there

289
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
With the picture she cut out

290
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Her own face on a milk

291
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Carton

292
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
I remember there

293
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
A lot of police showing up

294
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
A police

295
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
Within hours of the neighbor of finding the picture

296
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
Police had sworn Bonnie's home

297
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
She was whisked away and returned to her father

298
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
She was having at the time

299
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,471
But their Union wasn't easy at first

300
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
I remember

301
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,079
Being scared because I didn't know my dad

302
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
And I'll be with her

303
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
Bonnie is very clear that her mother loved her

304
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,671
What you didn't know then was that she'd been denied some pretty basic

305
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
Pieces of her childhood

306
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,791
In the three and a half years he was missing money didn't go to school

307
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
Jen learn to read

308
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
I know I didn't read and then because I would have realized that I was missing because on the picture Attack

309
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Actually said

310
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
Missing child

311
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
And then my name and the date

312
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
After returning to her dad

313
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Bonnie's had a pretty normal life

314
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,503
She started school went on to college and eventually became a nurse

315
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
Just two kids now

316
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
She's really happy

317
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
She's one of the milk carton campaigns

318
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Fue success

319
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,999
I believe that I am who I am

320
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,119
Because I was on a milk carton and II was found and

321
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:38,495
I had opportunities that with my dad growing up that I might not have had with my mom

322
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,591
I was able to live a great life and I'm grateful for it

323
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,527
2 years the milk carton campaign had ended but the faces of missing children were still being printed on all

324
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
Kinds of other things

325
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
Pizza boxes

326
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
Plastic grocery bags

327
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Utility bills

328
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,951
Actually the utility bill campaign

329
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
Went on for 10 years

330
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
Much longer than a milk carton

331
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,607
But most of us haven't even heard of it

332
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
It didn't stick

333
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,191
The weight of the milk carton did

334
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,263
Again here is Palmer's Vicki Renfro

335
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
The historian

336
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:18,175
It's one of those troops with which role familiar and it's appeared in the novel's film

337
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
Now there's a band called the Milk Carton Kids

338
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:26,367
There was something different about seeing a face on the side of a milk carton that really struck a nerve

339
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,927
There is a sense of familial

340
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Unity

341
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
But I think milk

342
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
Helps

343
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
The author maternal nurturance

344
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,863
Also being this kind of

345
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
Item around which people gather

00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
Around The Breakfast Table

347
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,263

Horn

349
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
That item

350
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
What's white deliver in

351
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Perhaps

352
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
The reason why that lives on
