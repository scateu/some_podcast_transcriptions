26
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,776
Large part it has been designed for the average

27
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,200
Brought your education you've been given standardized tests and been graded by how well you perform compared to the average

All these measurements are based around

00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
Concept

32
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,672
And it's okay we know you're not at

33
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
You're really special

34
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,048
Well I mean it you're not average

35
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
No one is

36
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,584
Not completely

37
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
But the concept of average

38
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
Texas all

39
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,240
Everything seemed to be based around this reference point average

40
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,312
And obviously everything about societies Built This Way

41
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,104
But I never really thought of it

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
Until I dug into

43
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
7 part of this is

44
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Todd Road

45
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,296
My name is Todd Rose I am the director of the mind brain education

At the Harvard graduate school education

48
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
He's also the author of the book

49
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
The end of average

50
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,208
But he had to that first we have to

51
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
Start with the

52
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Beginning of average

53
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,560
Because it wasn't always a thing

54
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,216
The concept of average as we know it was pioneered by a Belgian mathematician and astronomer named out of Kevlar

55
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,776
So Kelly is the person who actually

56
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,568
Coins the term the average man

57
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
And he is

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
In like the 1830s

59
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,456
She is actually an astronomer in Belgium

60
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,296
Today the way the most people get a handle on any set of numbers

61
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
Calculate

62
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
Catalyst

63
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,208
Astronomers were some of the only people who did this

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,584
Basically averages were a way to compensate for the imprecise tools that astronomers were working with

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
In 1830

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
If you were trying to time

67
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:50,496
The movement of Saturn you would actual scratches on your glass of your

68
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,872
Telescoping as soon as it crossed one you start counting and stopped counting after across the other

69
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,456
But you can imagine you're off by half a second

70
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
It's going to be a lot of error

71
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
And so

72
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,624
They they realize if they wanted to make sense of

73
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Painting heaven

74
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
They needed more

75
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
Precision in their ass

76
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
And they realize that if you had saved

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
10 measurements

78
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
They were all slightly different

79
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,400
You added them together and divided them by 10

80
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,192
You got a better approximation of

81
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
True measure

82
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,776
If you just average together are measurement

83
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,104
You're way more likely to be closer to the truth right end

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
You end up getting kind of a bell curve of measurement error

85
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,248
Cadillac was the first to take this tool of astronomers and Appliance

86
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
Two people

87
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
In the early 1840s

88
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
Is Cadillac find a data set

89
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,184
Of the chest measurements of 5738

90
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
Scottish soldiers

91
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:47,328
Kelly added together each of the measurements and divided by the total sum of the soldiers

92
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Net result

93
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,656
39 and 3/4 in

94
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,704
Was one of the very first time

95
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
Scientists had calculated

96
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
The average size

97
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
I like humans

98
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,104
But he brings with it the idea of Truth

99
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
That the average

100
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,992
Chastise is true and that all the individuals are like error

101
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,552
That nature striving for the average Soldier

102
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,112
This means the average measurement is the

103
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Truemeasureman

104
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
Platonic ideal

105
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
The perfect Scottish Soldier

106
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
Another joke

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,047
What is 39 and 3/4 inches

108
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
According to Cadillac

109
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,727
So he's the one that decides not only is average mathematical useful it's morally the way to think about people

110
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,079
And so he basically find averages anywhere he can possibly find them

111
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
And he measures all kinds of other people and averages them he create something called The Catalyst

112
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
Measuring ratios of average height and weight

113
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,343
Actually we still use it today

114
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
Just now it's called the body mass

115
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Index

116
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
4 BMI

117
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
Hillywood say

118
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
If you talk about height

119
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,583
Everyone if they were optimally fed if they were under the same environmental conditions

120
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,119
Would have been average

121
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
So his view was that

122
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
What you're striving for

123
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,031
Is the continual Improvement of the average of the group

124
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
And it wasn't all just physical

125
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,639
Timberlake homes through various data sets

126
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,479
It's for marriages murders and suicides and calculates the averages for them

127
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:14,623
He figures out there such a thing as a normal suicide rate which is really really bizarre the

128
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
But I'm almost scandalous

129
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,511
Nowadays when we're so used to the stability of big massive amount of data

130
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
That is hard

131
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Put your

132
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
Stuff in their shoes but like

133
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
Back then they really thought that

134
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
Something like to say

135
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Suicide

136
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
With such a personal

137
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Decision

138
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
And I couldn't possibly be any pattern there

139
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,615
But some of the word patterns

140
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
Body size intelligence

141
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
Birth of death

142
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
People became statistic

143
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
The behavior starts to become

144
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
Predictable

145
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
Suddenly human life

146
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
Went by the numbers

147
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:55,071
So obviously at the first interpretation is we'll wait a minute maybe there's no free well maybe there's laws of society

148
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
You just like the laws of physics

149
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
Black kick-started

150
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,959
A whole bunch of people like me like Karl Marx

151
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,239
To love cuddly

152
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
Until it becomes a huge star

153
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,871
This Time Cabaret was up there with the likes of Sir Isaac Newton

154
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,735
Is science of averages was this remarkable cutting-edge way to assess the health

155
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
Wellness and progress of population

156
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,135
He's really active in the 1820s and 1830s 1840s

157
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
I'm all the way up like the 50s and

158
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,231
The 1860s brings us

159
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
The US Civil War

160
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,095
Do another Super Fan of catalase Science of averages

161
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Abraham Lincoln

162
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,423
When the Civil War

163
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,983
Is going in the North Lincoln

164
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Actually

165
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
Kind of cleaner bucket Frank

166
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,615
Because this war had guns

167
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,407
So huge and unwieldy

168
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,943
Lincoln doesn't really have

169
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
Handle on the Northern Army

170
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
And

171
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,063
He's like we don't even know who our soldiers are we don't know

172
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,903
I will said they are we don't know what kind of armor they need we don't know anything about them

173
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:57,023
Lincoln decided that the Union Army needed more information about its soldiers

174
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
In order to best distribute resources

175
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,191
So he ordered this enormous study to assess the Union Army physically

176
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
Medically and Mentos

177
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,079
And then it explicit obedience to catalyze new science averages

178
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,871
Calculated and reported

179
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,943
They actually say basically we're following

180
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
The father of this new field cantlay

181
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
Bees freshly calculated averages

182
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
Informed the distributions of food ration

183
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
And the design of weapon

184
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
For example if you were going to create muskets

185
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
Well how far is the trigger

186
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:32,095
And you could actually calculate average reach for Soldier this also affected military uniform

187
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:37,215
Switch used to be all custom sound but in the Civil War so many people had to be outfitted

188
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,287
The custom uniforms would be impossibly expensive

189
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,591
So the uniforms had be mass-produced

190
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407
But they couldn't be just all one big floppy size

191
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
And so now they're letting go

192
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
Will you know if you break it into into subtypes

193
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,671
Broad shoulders small medium large

194
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,255
That's going to carry over into the way they think about the mass production of clothing

195
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
Yep the sizes small medium and large

196
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Which might be on your T-shirt tag

197
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,423
Those came out of this massive Civil War

198
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,495
So you can thank cataleya and Lincoln for that

199
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:15,871
This study in the Civil War was the basis for the American military's long-standing philosophy

200
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Standardized

201
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,479
Average base design design philosophy

202
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
From the Civil War forward

203
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
So in 1926

204
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
When the Army was designing it

205
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
First ever fighter plane

206
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
Engineers measure the physical dimensions

207
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
Hundreds of male Pilots

208
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
And use this data to standardize cockpit

209
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
Quite the possibility of female pilot

210
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Never considered

211
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,983
The size and shape of the seat that distance the pedals

212
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
Stick hide the windshield

213
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,895
Even the shape of the flight helmets were all made to conform to the average 1920s male pilot

214
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,199
Change the way the pilots were select

215
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,039
You basically then select people that fit into that and then exclude people that died

216
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,343
Design works okay

217
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
Up to World War II

218
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,927
What happened was though is that

219
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
In World War II

220
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
It became

221
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:08,095
An Air Force War right after the first time when the air force would be the determinant of

222
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
Who is going to win the war

223
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,191
And we we actually ran out of Pilots

224
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,263
The government recruited hundreds of new pilots

225
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
An expanded military Aviation

226
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,383
It's been a bunch of money on fancy new planes

227
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Although

228
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
The cockpit

229
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,247
We're still design for the average 1920s male

230
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,599
And this new big bad military force was going to fly to fast

231
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Listen to highest

232
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
Be the best

233
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,767
But that's not what happened they actually had a pretty massive decline in

234
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Performance

235
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,071
Including to the rash

236
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
Pilots were dying all the time

237
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:49,055
Even after the war ended just in training they could not control airplanes it became kind of part of the culture of the

238
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
It's just really dangerous to fly

239
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
No one knew what was going on

240
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:59,807
Some people thought propeller planes anymore maybe these new pilots just can't deal with the new aviation technology

241
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,671
And then they were like well maybe you got to train them better and they did their better training programs and that didn't work

242
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
After blaming the pilot

243
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,999
The training programs in the technology

244
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
Finally dawned on them

245
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
What is the cockpit

246
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
Maybe it doesn't this anymore

247
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,167
Their first instinct is to think

248
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:22,079
We just got bigger the people so the old average for 1922 is just too small right which is bigger and badder

249
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,735
So in 1950 researchers at Wright Air Force Base in Ohio

250
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
Tasked with finding this new average

251
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
And one of those researchers

252
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,159
With a man named Gilbert s Daniels

253
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:42,559
Daniels was a Harvard graduate could written his thesis on the average sizes of his classmates hands

254
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,351
It was 23 years old

255
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
Small skinny nerdy

256
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Not a military man at all

257
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,007
And he travels all the countries are Air Force bases

258
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
And his job is to take these tape measures

259
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,151
And just measure like 147 different dimensions

260
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,527
Tedious job ever and is Daniel's is traveling around

261
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,087
From Base to Base measuring thousands of Airmen

262
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
He's realizing this

263
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
Portable variability from person to person

264
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,999
Even within this limited demographic of young men

265
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,559
As he was measuring hands and legs and waist

266
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
4 heads

267
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Daniel kept asking him

268
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,935
How many Pilots were actually average

269
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
So he reports back

270
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
So he goes limited like I think

271
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,847
I can get a problem with the average and he says I just want to do this

272
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,967
Decide study I want to know if we take the 10 dimensions of size that matter most

273
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
For design

274
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
Like save shoulder-width

275
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
I8

276
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,087
Chest circumference sleeve length

277
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
How many of these Pilots are actually average

278
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
Daniel's crunch the numbers

279
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,071
Andaba 4063 Pilots he measured

280
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Not

281
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Single Airmen

282
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
Was close to average

283
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
In all of the

284
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
The 10 dimensions

285
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
Naughty

286
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Not one

287
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,823
And it got even worse like if you just used

288
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
Three dimensions of

289
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
Size

290
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
Less than 5% of the pilots were hours

291
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
So he quickly realizes like

292
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
Wait now you know the problem

293
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,343
If you are designing something for an average

294
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,647
Pilot it's literally designed if it nobody

295
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,463
And in this new era of jet-powered Aviation

296
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,047
Four Pilots were making split-second decisions that could be life or death

297
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,631
It really matter that Pilots could reach what they needed to reach in the cockpit

298
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,447
The military spring2action pretty much right away

299
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
For the military

300
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
Three willing to

301
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,335
Basically drop generations of

302
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,223
Design philosophy right it doesn't take them more than a few years to just be like you can't design an hour today

303
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:42,111
Air Force engineers and contractors designed adjustable foot pedals and adjustable helmet straps and flight suit

304
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Adjustable seats

305
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,951
I just can't believe that we are building plans with no adjustable seat

306
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:52,607
That's how much faith we had in the average person once all the adjustable elements another design Solutions were put into place

307
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Pilot performance

308
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Sword

309
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
Of course now we take this for granted

310
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,031
What equipment should fit a wide range of body sizes

311
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,591
Instead of standardized around 1 Ave

312
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,663
You wouldn't buy a car

313
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,527
Crazy and it seeps into their pretty quickly in terms of automobiles

314
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
And then you see

315
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,599
What's interesting is the whole idea of

316
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Ergonomics

317
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
That all comes off of the street at

318
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
What word jump-starts the science of ergonomics

319
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
Text which is not just for officer

320
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,839
Well it's really the study of work

321
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
Is what you

322
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
You could boil it down

323
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,703
But it really is a matter of matching

324
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
In people's

325
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
Capacity

326
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,335
To the job this is Professor Carissa Harris Adamson

327
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,407
Director of the UCSF UC Berkeley ergonomics

328
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
Program

329
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
It's

330
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,759
Really important not to go with the average

331
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
A lot of the time

332
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
If we want to

333
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
Incorporates a handle

334
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,439
Well we'll look up anthropometry data and

335
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Make sure we identify

336
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
Span

337
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
Or if we're designing

338
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
Crank and we wanted to be at a certain height

339
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,423
Then we will go back to them

340
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
Data and figure out

341
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
What makes the most sense

342
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
To accommodate

343
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,847
Keeping in mind that in the US

344
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,151
Most of the measurements we base our designs on

345
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Still

346
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Company USR

347
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Not

348
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
Primarily the

349
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
The source that we use

350
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
And

351
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,087
Say ergonomic bucks or when

352
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,695
What we found is that those numbers are actually all

353
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
Pretty representative today

354
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
Except for weight

355
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
An abdominal girth

356
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,399
Which is part of why the world is so hard for heavier people to navigate

357
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
The military might be considered a more fit pop

358
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
And then the rest

359
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
So does this mean that like military measurement

360
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Affect

361
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
The way our cars are

362
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
Absolutely

363
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,199
The measurements of our military personnel over the years

364
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
Sfax just about

365
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,295
Military measurements are the most

366
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
And they work okay

367
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
You're not perfect

368
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
Sure but they're getting more

369
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,999
They've done a really good job in a company name or the population

370
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Given that women are

371
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Now very

372
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
Vibrant part

373
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Of our military

374
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,167
When the military opted to design for a greater range of

375
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,239
People they designed for a greater range of opportunity

376
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
Take for example

377
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Kim Campbell

378
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
She was a fighter pilot

379
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
And

380
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
She flew

381
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,759
A A-10 Warthog in it's worth Googling it is like the baddest looking

382
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
Playing you're ever going to see

383
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,623
That's tyros Again by the way helping us tell the story

384
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Captain Campbell

385
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:29,279
In 2003 Campbell was sent on a mission to assess submarines who are trying to take a bridge in a rock

386
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,071
They were under heavy fire

387
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
But either way back or playing

388
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Shot

389
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
And she loses all control

390
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
She has the option

391
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
2

392
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Big Jack

393
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,055
Right there and save her life but then the plane

394
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
Spirals into Baghdad

395
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
I didn't kill too much

396
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,967
She stabilized what I don't know how you do

397
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
And she flies back and then she says

398
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
I think I can land This Plane

399
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,879
And she lands the massive damage.

400
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Uncontrollable playing

401
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
It's an incredible heroic theme

402
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
Really I'm president

403
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,815
Of course Kim Campbell get Awards and distinctions

404
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,655
And she is someone who could have never been one of the best

405
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Pilots in the world

406
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,751
Had the military not change their design philosophy

407
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,311
She's the beneficiary of a cockpit

408
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Wesley design

409
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
Five four

410
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
Ralph n

411
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,967
And don't look anything remotely close to an average sized pile

412
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:25,087
When Kim gets into a cockpit she has to put the seat all the way up and pull the pedals

413
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
All the way out

414
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
But it fits

415
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,719
Does idea of equal fit as the foundation for How We Do

416
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
Think about real Whopper

417
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
Trade in society

418
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
SiriusXM

419
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
Future of design

420
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
In this concept

421
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,655
That's it makes opportunity

422
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
It's an important one for

423
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,775
Because he believes that we can design environments

424
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Equipment and even entire system

425
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
To accommodate more and more

426
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
When we think about how we design environment

427
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
You know in a lot of fields

428
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
We made some progress around

429
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
Accommodating wider range

430
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,903
The people but actually in things like education we still actually design

431
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
For this mythical average person

432
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,559
Under the assumption that if you design something that fit an average person it would actually fit most

433
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
People

434
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,399
By re-examining the concept of the average

435
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
Etymology its limitations

436
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,799
We can maybe start to consider other ways of assessing and categorizing test scores

437
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
Clothing size

438
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
Wellness happiness worth

439
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
We can pave the way for more people

440
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Or outside

441
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Because

442
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Really

443
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
No one

Between the beats

459
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
Bongs and chatter of our devices

460
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,895
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

461
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
If

462
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:32,319

468
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,959
To make them more human

469
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
Turn the living room lights on

Okay

474

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

518
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
