I'm Roman Mars

31
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:39,584
In July 1980 a group of Salvadoran immigrants cross the border from Mexico into Arizona

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
They walked over an isolated mountain range and halfway across a wide Desert Valley there were more than two

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
Two dozen of them

34
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
People who love behind lives and jobs

35
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,104
To come to the United States

36
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,176
They hired some guys to leave them on the journey

37
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,736
Reporting our story this week is Delaney Hall

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,088
And those guys had brought them to a largely uninhabited part of the Border

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
It was a bath

40
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,952
Empty and fatally hot stretch of the Sonoran Desert

41
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:11,840
The temperature the next day got up to around a hundred and 1215 degrees out there

42
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
Was deadly

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
This is John 5

44
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,704
Peter Presbyterian Minister from Tucson

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,264
Which is a couple of hours from where the migrants cross

46
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,848
They were in the middle of the most desolate

47
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,920
And and deadly area of the desert

48
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,760
And I think out of the group of

49
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
26

50
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
12 of them died

51
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
The first day out

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,672
The survivors were eventually found

53
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,512
Delirious and suffering from intense dehydration and Heat

54
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,072
Some of them had stripped off their clothes

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,656
Border patrol agents brought them to a hospital in Tucson

56
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,704
Which is where Reverend John Feit

57
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
And they are some of us who are

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
For pastors

59
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,616
To provide some pastoral care for the survivors who were

60
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
Traumatized behind

61
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Understand

62
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,760
And they began to tell me

63
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
Why they fled El Salvador

64
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,904
At that point rev-5 had lived in Tucson for more than 10 years

65
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,000
We need a small congregation at a church called Southside Presbyterian

66
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
He didn't know much about Central America

67
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:19,424
Or what was going on in countries like Nicaragua Guatemala and

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
El Salvador

69
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Around this time

70
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,800
Not only ignorant but I couldn't put El Salvador on a map

71
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,408
I knew it was somewhere between Mexico and Panama but that was the extent of my knowledge

72
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
So

73
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,760
So I had a lot to learn and a lot of catching up

74
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
People of El Salvador

75
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,400
El Salvador Civil War had been decades in the making

76
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:56,288
Since the early 1900s the country had been ruled by a series of oligarchs and corrupt military leaders

77
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,896
They maintain control over pressing large segments of the rural population

78
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,224
In the late 1970s and early 1980s

79
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
Number of left-wing Guerrilla groups

80
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
Begin to grow in power and info

81
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
The military responded by trying to

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Crushed

83
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,768
Death squads targeted union leaders Community organizer

84
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,095
And other people they suspected of sympathizing with

85
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
The Gorillaz

86
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
That included priest

87
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
And nothing

88
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,495
Lots of civilians were caught in the middle of the

89
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
Violence

90
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Thousands

91
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
People word

92
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
Disappeared murdered words

93
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,879
And El Salvador wasn't the only country where this was happening

94
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:48,767
Similar conflicts were unfolding in Nicaragua and Guatemala where authoritarian governments were facing pressure

95
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
Left-wing Rebels

96
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,631
This is the history Reverend John by started to learn about

97
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,983
What do you meant the Salvadoran migrants who nearly died in the desert near to

98
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,055
But basically they were telling me why they fled

99
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
El Salvador

100
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
About

101
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
Threats from Death Squad

102
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:11,039
Killings of members of their family or close friends that sort of thing

103
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
And and the reason why they they had

104
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
He didn't know it then

105
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,975
But rev-5 was witnessing the beginning of something big

106
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:24,351
Hundreds of thousands of central Americans were trying to get away from these dangerous and bloody Civil War

107
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
They were fleeing their countries

108
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
Making their way through Mexico

109
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
In Crossing into the United States

110
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
So a major

111
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,943
Migration of refugees occurred along this border during that 10-year period beginning in 90

112
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,087
Reverend 5church set less than 100 miles from the border

113
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
And it would be completely swept up

114
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
In this crisis

115
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:53,023
Eventually Fife in his congregants would give shelter to hundreds of central Americans

116
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,095
Baby joined by a network of churches across the country

117
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,911
All opening their doors and giving migrants

118
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,703
A safe place to stay

119
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:05,311
This would Mark the beginning of a new and controversial social movements

120
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,895
Based on the old religious concept of sanctuary

121
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,991
The idea that churches have a duty to shelter people fleeing purse

122
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,391
Persecution more than 6000 people have signed up to provide Sanctuary around the country

123
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
Down on so-called

124
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
Sanctuary City

125
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
There are

126
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
There's been a lot of

127
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,815
Talk about sanctuary in the news recently

128
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,631
And the modern movement in the US

129
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
Can trace its roots back

130
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
2 rev 5

131
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,031
We're going to spend the next two episodes looking at how the sanctuary movement started

132
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079
And how it caused one of the biggest Showdown

133
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
Between church and state

134
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
In recent history

135
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,319
After that first encounter with the Salvadorans at the hospital

136
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,927
Reverend fight begin to see more and more Central Americans arriving in Tucson

137
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
Some of them would come to his church

138
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
And ask for help

139
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,607
At first his inclination was to work within the rules of the immigration

140
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,399
I was

141
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
Pretty naive its hit point

142
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,055
And I went to the immigration office here in Tucson

143
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
Met with the director

144
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,663
And said we're seeing refugees

145
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
Who are fleeing for their lives

146
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
What do we need to do to protect them

147
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
And he said

148
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,367
Well we have good political Asylum law

149
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
On the books

150
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,463
And if they're deserving of political Asylum

151
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,279
If they're refugees they'll get political Asylum

152
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,095
Asylum you apply for if you are

153
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
Within the United States

154
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,239
And have a well-founded fear of persecution

155
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
I'm talking law

156
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
This is Ruth and Meyer

157
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,919
I was District director of the immigration and naturalization service

158
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
For Arizona

159
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,527
Nineteen Eighty-Four in a couple years later they added Nevada

160
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,855
Since 1980 when Congress passed the refugee Act

161
00:07:54,367 --> 00:08:00,511
The US has asked people to meet a number of requirements in order to be granted political Asylum they have to establish the

162
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
They fear persecution in their home country

163
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
Based on their race

164
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,399
Religion nationality political opinion

165
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
Her social group

166
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:12,031
They also have to convince immigration that their government is actually involved

167
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
In their persecution

168
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
Or if they can't control the group

169
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Sitar

170
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
If someone shows up in the US

171
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
And they can meet those requirements

172
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Supposed to be able to

173
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
Stay

174
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,575
But it's not always that simple

175
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,951
Myers used to interview people seeking Asylum if she says it could be tough to establish a person status

176
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,559
It relied heavily on a single individuals testimony about what they've been through

177
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
Depends on the individual

178
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,679
It depends on what they say and how they say it

179
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
And if they have any backing

180
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,543
So basically it was my decision

181
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
Based on my experience and

182
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
What the person said because

183
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,687
As you can understand

184
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
It was very little physical evidence

185
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,903
Despite the challenges of qualifying for a silent Reverend Fife in his church raise some money in organized legal assistance for the

186
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,511
The migrants I started visiting detention centers and helping people fill out Asylum application

187
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,815
Pay range for lawyer to represent them in court

188
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887
But it began to seem like even the people who met their

189
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,447
Requirements for Asylum we're not getting

190
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
Like even in cases where there was four

191
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Physical evidence

192
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,615
I can remember taking in a guy

193
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,175
Who had been tortured

194
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
In El Salvador

195
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
And

196
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,415
We flew in an Amnesty International Doctor Who testified that the address guys been tortured I'm an expert on

197
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
And the physical effects

198
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
Torture

199
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
And the immigration judge would order him

200
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
Deported the neck

201
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
Rev 5 begin to wonder what was behind these decisions

202
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,983
Central Americans hoping for Asylum face some significant

203
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,847
One thing just as they began turning up along the US Mexico border in 1980

204
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,663
Tens of thousands of refugees from other place

205
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
Buy Cuba in Tehran

206
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
We're also seeking refuge in the United States

207
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
The government was overwhelmed with application

208
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:05,695
Most Central Americans had also historically come to the US for jobs

209
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
Not because of political

210
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
Persecution

211
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,327
The government was more inclined to see them as economically

212
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
And on top of that

213
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
Where was the Cold War

214
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
Mr. speaker

215
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,711
Distinguished members of the Congress honored guests and

216
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
My fellow Americans

217
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,647
In 1983 President Ronald Reagan delivered a special televised speech before Congress

218
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,767
In it he outlined his concerns about the Civil Wars flaring up in Central America

219
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:47,679
2 minute photo Central America is just that place way down below Mexico that can possibly constituted

220
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
Red door will be

221
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
And that's why I've asked for this session

222
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,127
Central America's problems do directly affect the security

223
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
And the well-being of our own vehicle

224
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,527
And Central American Soul Central America is an important front in the Cold War

225
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:08,927
A region so close to the us that are National Security required us to stop communist movements from flourishing there

226
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:14,559
Nicaragua is Justice close to Miami San Antonio San Diego and Tucson

227
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,375
Have no cities are the Washington where we're gathered

228
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Good night

229
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,239
Just a few years earlier in 1979

230
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
A socialist Revolution actually did happen

231
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
Nicaragua

232
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:31,967
The Saint Denis the National Liberation Front head elstad a us back to dictatorship

233
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
Which is ruled the country for deck

234
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
At the time of this speech

235
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:40,927
Reagan administration was sending Aid to contras fighting the new socialists and then he's the government

236
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:47,327
The US was also doing its best to suppress similar left-wing movements in El Salvador and Guatemala

237
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,167
Authoritarian governments that still had a grip on power in those countries

238
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
Information I say to you that tonight

239
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
There can be no question

240
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
The National Security of all the Americas

241
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Is at stake

242
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
In Central America

243
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Thank you

244
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
God bless you in German

245
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:10,111
So here's how this all connects back to Tucson and the deportations that Reverend fight with

246
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
Racine

247
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
Because the US government

248
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,999
Considered the governments of El Salvador and Guatemala

249
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
To be political allies

250
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
It's in the fight against communism

251
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,887
It denied these governments were person

252
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
Executing their own pee

253
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,823
The Reagan almost all Salvadoran and Guatemalan border crossers were classified not as political refugees

254
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
What is economic micro

255
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,919
That meant they didn't qualify for Asylum

256
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
They got sent back

257
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:42,111
Ruth Ann Meyers the former ins director in Arizona says immigration officers followed policy set by the

258
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,159
Which has broad discretion

259
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
When it comes to Asylum

260
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
The immigration officers

261
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,631
Weatherby enforcement or the Asylum officers or whatever

262
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,471
We're not making up their criteria are the wall

263
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
This all came from Congress

264
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
The result of this policy was

265
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
Stark when it came to Salvadorans in Guatemala

266
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,199
Between 1983 and 1986

267
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,319
You were than 3% of Salvadorans in Guatemalans who applied for Asylum or approve

268
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
Not same.

269
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
The approval rate for Irani ends with six

270
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,255
Bracken's fleeing the Soviet invasion it was close to

271
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
40%

272
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:26,655
Back in Tucson that put rev-5 in his congregants in a tough position

273
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:32,799
They didn't want to encourage migrants to report immigration when they knew it was almost certain they be deported

274
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,639
So they held a series of meetings to figure out what to do

275
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
And that's when Jim Corbett

276
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
Showing up

277
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,295
It's hard to describe him because he was

278
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
Unique

279
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Figure

280
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
Jim Corbett died in 2001

281
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
The back in the 80s he lived on the edge of Tucson

282
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
Erase to goats

283
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
And he knew a lot

284
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
It's about philosophy

285
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
He was also a Quaker

286
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,935
And as the refugee crisis in Tucson continue to grow

287
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,263
Jim's religious Faith compelled him to take action

288
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,591
He started letting refugees stay at his house

289
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,175
And in some other ramshackled trailers scattered around his property

290
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:15,551
Jim starts coming to meetings at Southside Presbyterian Church where they're discussing the deportations

291
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
Another one of those meetings

292
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
Jim comes up to rev 5

293
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
And

294
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
His

295
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
Contention at that point

296
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
To me was

297
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:28,863
John I don't think we have any choice under the circumstances

298
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Except

299
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
2

300
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:37,055
Begin to smuggle people safely across the border so that they're not captured and detained and deported

301
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,383
My response was how the hell do you figure that Jim

302
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
And he

303
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Explain

304
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,271
Duke's Lane

305
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,831
The first was back in the 1800s when church people

306
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
A lot of them Quakers

307
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,487
Help to move runaway slaves across state lines and through the Underground Railroad to safety

308
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,535
And he basically said

309
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,935
We have to conclude from history that they got it right those were the folks who understood

310
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Good and got it right

311
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:12,127
Dungeon pointed to the church and its failure to protect Jewish people fleeing the Holocaust in the 1930s

312
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
40s

313
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:17,503
Many Jews were detained and deported back to Germany where they were killed

314
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,575
Jim argued that Christians should have done more

315
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,647
And he said they

316
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
They failed

317
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
They failed,

318
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,047
As people of Faith as the church

319
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,375
And I said yeah you're right

320
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,191
And his punchline was

321
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
John

322
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,567
I don't think we can allow that to happen on our border

323
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
In our time

324
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
And after a couple of

325
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
Sleepless nights

326
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
I went back to him and said yeah you're right

327
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
I

328
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
I

329
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
Cannot be a pastor of a church

330
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
Beer on the border

331
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
And

332
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Not

333
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
Do what you're asking

334
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
So

335
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
Sign me up

336
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,863
At this point Jim Corbett had already done some border runs on his own

337
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,959
Picking up migrants in Mexico and helping them cross the border into United States

338
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
But now Reverend Fife and a handful of others started helping him

339
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
At first they bring people across and put them up at Jim's house

340
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,663
Play quickly became clear they needed more space

341
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
So once again

342
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
Tim came to talk with Reverend V

343
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,551
He wanted the church to start hosting people

344
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,367
That was a question that the whole congregation had

345
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
How to deal with

346
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
And that's not an easy choice for

347
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
For people to me

348
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
They talked

349
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,815
And prayed and then voted to let Central American refugees stay

350
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,631
Soon On Any Given night

351
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,703
The church would have dozens of people sleeping in the main gather

352
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
Church members would provide food

353
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,871
Close English lessons Medical Care and access to legal advice

354
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
They help the refugees strategize about what to do

355
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,527
It wasn't as if the migrants were entirely safe

356
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
We're still undocumented

357
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,111
And face possible deportation

358
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,695
But they had access to resources guidance and a place

359
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
Stay

360
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,399
The congregation at Southside was drawing along religious tradition when they decided to take the refugees into their Church

361
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,959
It's actually

362
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
An ancient tradition of

363
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,543
Temples in

364
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,847
Churches and synagogues

365
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
And

366
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
And sacred sites

367
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,711
Of indigenous people

368
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,039
That goes back as far as any

369
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
History we know about

370
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,647
In Greek and Roman history people who are threatened with

371
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,207
Persecution could find protection in Temple

372
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,023
When the Roman Empire became Christian

373
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
Churches took on the same function

374
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,959
The concept of sanctuary can also be found in medieval canon law and British common law

375
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,031
Andaz nation-state evolved in Europe

376
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,591
Some of those Nations legally recognized

377
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
The rate of churches

378
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
Shelter

379
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
More recently

380
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,735
Churches sheltered conscientious objector

381
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,527
During the Vietnam war

382
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,367
But even though rev-5 was drawing on a long religious tradition

383
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:07,743
He is coming against we're still harboring undocumented immigrants who crossed into the country illegally

384
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
And as it turns out

385
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,607
Government was keeping an eye on their growing operation

386
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
Well what do we do under those circumstances

387
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,007
Dances in in the only conclusion we came to was

388
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,567
Well the only choice we have

389
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Is

390
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
To go public

391
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
With what word

392
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
They thought maybe

393
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
By going public

394
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,503
The church could generate attention and Publix

395
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,855
They invited a couple of other churches to join them in a public announce

396
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,415
And in March of 1982

397
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
They hung two huge banners

398
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,231
On the front of the church

399
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
They said in Spanish

400
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,095
This is a sanctuary of God for the oppressed

401
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
Central America

402
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
And

403
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Immigration

404
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,727
Do not profane sanctuary of

405
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:54,335
They held a service and publicly welcomed a new family from El Salvador

406
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,151
To join the other refugees who are staying at the church

407
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:01,503
And they stage press conference to explain exactly what the sanctuary movement was

408
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
And what their goals were

409
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,903
So yeah we we made some national news

410
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,303
The sanctuary movement has become a highly emotional issue supporters of that movement mainly church people

411
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,703
Refugees from Central America members of the so-called sanctuary

412
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:27,103
Illegal aliens from across the United States

413
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,151
Going to violate the laws of Nessa

414
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,735
Is the movement gain visibility it became more controversial

415
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:37,855
The federal government contends conscience is not a good excuse for violating the law

416
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,903
Our objection to any

417
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,695
Such move it

418
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
Is that

419
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
Text Louis Vuitton hats

420
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887
Despite these government objections

421
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
The movement continue to grow

422
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,775
More and more churches and synagogues started to get in touch with rev 5

423
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
They call us and say

424
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,895
Can you send us a family we're going to declare sanctuary

425
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
A network started to develop

426
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,479
Richmond rev-5 in Jim Corbett

427
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:09,599
How to figure out how to safely transport refugees across the country to the churches that could support them

428
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,927
And so Jim and I basically sat

429
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Down

430
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
Here

431
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,279
A map of the United States

432
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:23,935
And said okay who do you know in Albuquerque and who do you know in Denver and who do you know

433
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,519
Across the United States so we could move people

434
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
And we literally in one afternoon

435
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:34,687
Figured out an underground railroad in we modeled is on the old Underground Railroad

436
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:45,439
By the mid-1980s hundreds of churches and synagogues across the country had joined the sanctuary movement

437
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,023
Almost every mainstream church denomination and gotten involved

438
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,815
Including Lutheran's Methodist

439
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
In Baptist

440
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:56,703
Sanctuary volunteers came from a wide variety of political viewpoints including conservative

441
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,567
But everyone should have believed that churches needed to respond to the Central American crisis

442
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
These American churches were

443
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
We're connected to a network

444
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
Churches

445
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,479
Extended down into Mexico and Central America

446
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,783
So migrants could plug into

447
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
This network

448
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
And make their Way North

449
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,184
Some would find shelter in Mexico others would continue into the US

450
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,512
That's exactly what patricija Barcelo did

451
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:26,912
My name is Patricia Barcelo I am a refugee from Guatemala and I have lived in the United States since 1980

452
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,472
85 Patricia grew up in Guatemala City

453
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,288
Their parents were Union organizers during the Civil War

454
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
Which made them a Target

455
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
A big government

456
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
They live with my dad and my mom

457
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,432
Being involved in subversive Acts

458
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
In wanting to overthrow the government

459
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,576
And that was enough for them to kill you disappear you or

460
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,136
Another whatever they wanted to do to you

461
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,208
At one point patrizia's dad disappeared for many weeks

462
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
Ben 10

463
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,768
By the military are the

464
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
Police

465
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
Patrizia's family never learned exact

466
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,632
She came home

467
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,216
Being the shadow of a man that he was

468
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,776
Because he was so skinny in

469
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
Boney

470
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
Can a beard for long hair

471
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
My dad

472
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
But he's made it back

473
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
And

474
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
With him

475
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Pita bread

476
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,368
Horrible story of torture

477
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,696
And things that had been done to him that

478
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
Humane

479
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,120
At that point patricios parents fled to Mexico City

480
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,448
Reading Patricia and her sister with their grandmother

481
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,776
The parents said they'd be in touch when they had a plan

482
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,312
For two years

483
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Nothing

484
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
And then a letter from her mother

485
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,664
And the letter said

486
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,224
You know bring the girls to the Border

487
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,016
Bring him to this part in Chiapas

488
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
And I will be there waiting

489
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:53,952
Patricia and her sister across the border from Guatemala into Mexico and met their mom as a designated Park

490
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,536
They learn that she'd met some Quakers involved in the sanctuary movement

491
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,096
The Quakers told the family to head to Northern Mexico

492
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,424
But they were met by Catholic priest named father Ricardo elford

493
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
He worked closely

494
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
The drive-in 5

495
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,032
He wanted to know what happened in Guatemala

496
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
He wanted to know why we were

497
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,872
Wanting to come to the US

498
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
He said

499
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,432
You know just tell me

500
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
You know

501
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
What went on

502
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
Because you want to bring you

503
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
We just want to know what

504
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,832
We can do for you

505
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
And

506
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
My mom

507
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,184
Told him everything that happened

508
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,488
That the two and then he said

509
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
Everything is going to be okay

510
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,584
Father Alfred was wedding the fan

511
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,632
Just making sure they qualify

512
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
Is refugees

513
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:39,520
At the sanctuary Network had grown they've had to develop a more formalized

514
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Process

515
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,384
This was partly to ensure their limited resources went towards helping p

516
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,408
People who were most

517
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
Stephanie

518
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,528
We wanted to try and ensure they weren't putting volunteers at risk

519
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
Bringing someone dangerous

520
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
Into US

521
00:23:53,856 --> 00:24:00,000
What are the government's criticisms of the sanctuary movement was that they lack the expertise and resources to evaluate potential refugee

522
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,840
The government worried they might be helping criminals enter the country

523
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
Or communist

524
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,168
Who wanted to undermine the US government

525
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
Here's rev-5 again

526
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,008
I would just kind of smile and say

527
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,312
You don't understand the church

528
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
We have the best intelligence system in the world

529
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:22,016
As I understand what you say is you have 5c IAH

530
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
In El Salvador

531
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
Right now

532
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,112
I have thousands

533
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:32,768
They're called priests and pastors and all I have to do is pick up the phone and call them and they'll give me the whole fam

534
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Family history

535
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:40,192
Once father Alfred was satisfied that Patricia and her family actually met the requirements for ref

536
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
ATT status

537
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:47,360
He arranged for them to be brought across the border from Tucson where they stayed at st. Michael's Episcopal

538
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,176
Another church in town that had declared sanctuary

539
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,992
You're living there for 6 months they moved into a house

540
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,808
And started the long process of applying to stay in the US

541
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:59,392
It took them more than six years of legal wrangling to receive Asylum

542
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:05,536
Patrizia still gets emotional thinking about what the sanctuary movement did for her and her family

543
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
I remember my parents

544
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,376
Talking about this and saying

545
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
You know

546
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
Who would do this

547
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
Who would risk their

548
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Life

549
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
You know

550
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
The Good Life

551
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
Pier in the US

552
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
For people like us

553
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,528
But as the movement grew bigger and more visible

554
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,576
The whole Endeavor became risk

555
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,368
But quite frankly

556
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
I never thought we were going to get away with

557
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:39,840
The first time I went to the border to do a Crossing

558
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,400
1981 song

559
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704

We weren't going to get away with

562
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,568
Did the government was going to come after

563
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
And it was only a matter of

564
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
John was right

565
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,944
It was only a matter of

566
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
Time

567
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:00,064
And the religious motivations of the sanctuary movement didn't get much sympathy

568
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
The from the government

569
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,160
They have the right to think what they want anybody.

570
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,256
That doesn't exclude them from obeying the walls of the United States

571
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
Somebody could say

572
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,888
I think it's my religious right to rob a liquor store

573
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,472
