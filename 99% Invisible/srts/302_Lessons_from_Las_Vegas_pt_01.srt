This is 99% invisible

24
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,704
On the University of Pennsylvania camp

26
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
There's this

27
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,520
Gorgeous old library

28
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,104
Which is the School of Design library of Fine Arts in architecture

29
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,664
It was designed by architect Frank

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
Furnace

31
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,248
Looks like a red brick and terracotta Palace

32
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,784
Producer Avery trufelman

33
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,392
It's got these leaded glass windows in this very elaborate roof

34
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
Articulated with lots of pointy

35
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,696
Ornaments

36
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,256
And a two-story rotunda reading room

37
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,352
According to its website it is a Seminole Library design

38
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
Expressive function

39
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,424
While merging the imagery of

40
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
Cathedral

41
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,216
And

42
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
Railroad state

43
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,080
It could be the sad for any number of scenes in Harry Potter

44
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
It's a National Historic Landmark

45
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,432
It was completed in 1890

46
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,760
So you may know the furnace library at that pandas

47
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,064
A wonderful 19th century

48
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
Building

49
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
This is Denise Scott Brown

50
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
Who studied urban planning

51
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
And then taught there

52
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,768
And at my first faculty meeting they were

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
Considering whether architecture schools should

54
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
Supposed to plan to demolish

55
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,424
The fiendish library

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
This is a 1961

57
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
Architects for variant

58
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,520
Tearing down old buildings

59
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,824
No one would dream of touching it now

60
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,640
But then I was a rebel and saying that

61
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
And there was a big debate

62
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,528
And the deed was on the other side he wanted it demolished

63
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,160
In 1960 Architects. We should be getting rid of old

64
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
Really architecture

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,304
Sure and constructing new modern efficient buildings of glass and steel in concrete

66
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Denise

67
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
On the other hand

68
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
Was kind of over modernism

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,216
Nothing she didn't like glass and steel in concrete

70
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
She like the buildings themselves

71
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,592
She's just getting tired of the philosophies behind modernism

72
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
She's tired of Architects

73
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,944
Imposing their Sleek utopian Visions on people

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,248
Without first asking people what they wanted

75
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
It was

76
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,832
Stupid Innocents to say we don't have to listen to

77
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
Two people they don't know what

78
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
They want

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,744
We can tell them what they also want that we will be so good for them

80
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
And so in her

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,072
First ever faculty meeting

82
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
Denise took a stand

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
Imagine her

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
In her late twenties

85
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,728
Red hair and an accent shaped

86
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,056
Buy a childhood in South Africa and an education in London

87
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
She battled the dean

88
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
To convince the rest of the faculty

89
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
This old library

90
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
Should be saved

91
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,320
That there's something to observing and appreciating the architecture that's already around us

92
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,392
And she won them over the whole

93
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,464
Psycho she finally agreed with me but not

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Before a lot of arguments

95
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
And

96
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,864
I'm sure all of that this young man came up to me and he said

97
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
I agreed with everything you said

98
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,240
And my name is Robert Venturi

99
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,032
And I said

100
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,848
Well why didn't you say something then

101
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Robert Venturi

102
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
Another young faculty member

103
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
Didn't want to admit it at the meeting

104
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
It wasn't cool to be in Texas

105
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
Extravagant old buildings then

106
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
Inventory was already kind of an out

107
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
He was struggling

108
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:17,024
The people that would say well he shouldn't be there he's not like he likes history

109
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
He didn't go to Harvard while he went to

110
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,399
But you wasn't from a fancy family

111
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,239
And yes he was really into historical architecture

112
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
Ann in Denise Scott Brown he found

113
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,335
Kindred spirit

114
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,151
They began to share ideas and research

115
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
They were both very into mannerism

116
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:42,111
Which is a late Renaissance style of architecture that has a lot of complex decoration and exaggerated visual tricks

117
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
Not unlike the furnace Library

118
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
It's a labyrinth

119
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,303
Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi work clearly on the same page

120
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
They taught courses in conjunction with each other

121
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,423
From 1960 to 65

122
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
Iran 1 series

123
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,007
Listen here on the other

124
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
And we

125
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
Camden together

126
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,871
Collie get pain was so bold as to suggest

127
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
Denise

128
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
You should marry Robert

129
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
But it wasn't like

130
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,551
Denise was actually a young Widow at the

131
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,367
She lost her husband in a car crash

132
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Pretty recent

133
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
She wasn't interested inventory that way

134
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
At least not yet

135
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
We were good friends

136
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,863
Don't forget I'd lost a husband I was a very sad

137
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Person

138
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
Denise did

139
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
However

140
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,751
Want to take her friend Robert Venturi

141
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
Two very special place

142
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
The place she considered the ante modernism

143
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
A place

144
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,991
The most of her colleagues in architecture and urban planning looked at with

145
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Stan

146
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Las Vegas

147
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
Fabulous

148
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,487
Las Vegas

149
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
And what happens in Vegas

150
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
Never really stays there

151
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,751
Together Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi

152
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
Define lessons in Las Vegas

153
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
That would spur a new chapter

154
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
In architecture

155
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
To this day architects

156
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,783
And turn their nose up at Las Vegas

157
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,831
Las Vegas is still a very

158
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,135
Controversial topic among architects

159
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,439
Typically dismiss the city

160
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
This is Stefan Al

161
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,791
Practicing architect and author of the book The Strip

162
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,863
Las Vegas and the architecture of the American dream

163
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:33,215
Everytime I tell my colleagues I study Las Vegas and I get a few frowns

164
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
From architecture perspective

165
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,567
It's a city that's known for neon

166
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,127
City known for candle decoration

167
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
Casino for kids

168
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
Exactly the opposite

169
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
A what

170
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
Conventionally trained architects

171
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
I would like

172
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,855
But people love Vegas

173
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
Last year there was about

174
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,463
45 million people that visited Las Vegas

175
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,279
And that was 10 million more than the City of Paris

176
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,607
To be clear here we're not talking about downtown Las Vegas

177
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
We're talking about the Las Vegas Strip

178
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
A long stretch of road flank

179
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Bike Casino

180
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:11,871
Yeah so a lot of people don't know that this trip is actually not built in the city of Las Vegas is actually just outside

181
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
Site outside of city limits

182
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,503
And as a result developers are not as much restricted by

183
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
City zoning laws work

184
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
City Council

185
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
And they have more

186
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,695
Leeway so to say which is why the Vegas

187
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,511
Strip is never one static thing

188
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
It goes through radical changes

189
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
Almost every decade

190
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,703
Since the whole stretch of the strip is geared entirely to what will bring in the most Taurus

191
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,823
Is design for what's popular at a given time so I'll make as much money as possible

192
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
As soon as

193
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:47,455
One of the buildings is no longer profitable or as soon as they realize they can

194
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,855
Actually build a more profitable building that is worth for them to implode the previous building and build something new

195
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
And this is how biggest is always be

196
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,999
Constantly remaking itself depending on what tourist want

197
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,071
It's designed and redesigned over and over again

198
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
For its visitors

199
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:10,751
The very first Casino Hotel complex on the Strip was called El Rancho Vegas

200
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
I had a western theme

201
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
Literally part of the advertising was

202
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Bring your wine

203
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,919
Western boots in your usn outfit

204
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
How you can wear your hat

205
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
In the 1940s

206
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
Western movies were popular

207
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,367
And the western themed made gambling seem a little more

208
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
Patriotic

209
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
Rugged

210
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,719
What cowboys did

211
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,535
Do you got to have gambling in a wild West Town

212
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,327
A real authentic

213
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
Wild West Town forever any Cowboys in Las Vegas and so it was from the very

214
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
Beginning Las Vegas architecture was

215
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
Where you could call

216
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,871
Fake and then in the 1950s as the

217
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,175
Fake Western fat got tired out

218
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:54,015
They traded it in for fake mid-century Suburban glamour

219
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
It really turn gambling into a Suburban vacation

220
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,647
There were all these glamorous bungalows

221
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
Kidney-shaped pools

222
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,743
But they all look more or less the same

223
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
So then came the sign

224
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,655
Starting with the Stardust Hotel and Casino

225
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,215
Big horizontal sign really big

226
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
Over 200 feet long

227
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:21,407
It looks like a giant explosion and their mind this was also. In which we see the space race

228
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,063
Start to begin up the ante on the competition between the hotels on the strip

229
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,463
And more massive hotels popped up with bigger and bigger sign

230
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:39,839
And it was a really kind of sophisticated technology that went into these structures

231
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
It was only because

232
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,447
The competition was was so intense and it was so much at stake

233
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,543
By the 1960s the Las Vegas Strip with a cacophony

234
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
I think eating Neon

235
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,431
All these huge jarring sign was calling out over each other

236
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
That's what the strip look like

237
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,295
When Denise Scott Brown first encounter.

238
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,111
I've had a cold shiver up my spine

239
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,951
And I said Is This Love or is this hate

240
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
I said I don't know

241
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,815
I said foot rabbit anyway before it goes

242
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,631
She first visited Vegas in 1980

243
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
C5

244
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,959
After she had left pain to take a job at Berkeley

245
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
Unlike the modernist

246
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,567
To it ignore a messy place like Las Vegas

247
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
Denise found herself

248
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
Curious about it

249
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,199
Given her background and urbanism in planning

250
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
She was interested in observing the

251
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Habits

252
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
Las Vegas was

253
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
A place people voted for with their feet

254
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
They went there in droves

255
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
They really showed they liked

256
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,791
They even spent money to be in it

257
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,887
The 1960s trip was the exact opposite of what modern architects

258
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
The world should look like

259
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
It was loud

260
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
Garish and dazzling

261
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
It was full-blown populism

262
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,359
And this is what Denise loved about the strap

263
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,175
She knew she had to show Robert Ventura

264
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,759
Bob was the only person I invited to Las Vegas cuz

265
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
It was the only one interested

266
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
And then he just adored it

267
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
In 1966

268
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,023
Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi spent 4 days in Las Vegas

269
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
Marveling at it

270
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
When Bob and I

271
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
Went to Las Vegas

272
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,959
I'm have this wonderful time together bad

273
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,543
Xiaomi he became a much more relaxed human being

274
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:29,151
We took photographs we drove the strip we had music on Wii

275
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,479
Jobs in the desert and we took pictures of each other

276
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:37,087
You look at the joy and the faces of those pictures and you see what's happening

277
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,415
You can google pictures of Denise and Robert grinning on the strip

278
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
Yeah

279
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
You can really see it

280
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
We fell in love

281
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
5 years of working together

282
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,423
It happened in 4 days

283
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Vegas

284
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
We were in a bar

285
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
Antoni we held him that's about all that have

286
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,383
And then we began to get more and more fond of each

287
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
After a little back and forth

288
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
He's got brown eventually move back

289
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Back to the East Coast

290
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
And then

291
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,295
Montana Tech

292
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:12,159
I just said to hit will you marry me and he said yes and yes and yes

293
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,279
Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown got married in 1967

294
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Get together

295
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
Yeah

296
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,399
But even though she was on the other side of the country

297
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
Denise wasn't done with Las Vegas

298
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
Not in the least

299
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:31,359
Anarchy changde Neeson Taken great pains to include the elements of observations

300
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,175
And what better spot to observe

301
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
In the strip

302
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
It was the epitome of

303
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Brawl

304
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
Allowed advertisement

305
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Shopping Center

306
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
It was

307
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
American culture

308
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Steroid

309
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,255
Extreme cases usually up uricase

310
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
I think if you look at

311
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,351
Scientific study

312
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,423
It's awesome down that's right let's get the most

313
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,471
Stream version and then from that

314
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
We can

315
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,567
Nerd with the principals where I look for them in other places

316
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,151
She and Robert Venturi resolved to bring their students

317
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
The strip

318
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
So they can see it themselves

319
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:18,207
Venturi and Scott Brown plant a 12 week long Studio studying Las Vegas for 13 students

320
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
10 days of this course

321
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
Would actually be spent

322
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,607
Itself we will all puts up at the starter

323
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,447
Scott Brown inventory got comp rooms for them and all the students

324
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
Took full advantage of the freedom they had off campus

325
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,079
We didn't notice when we went into their

326
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
The smell of marijuana

327
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,943
Because I just didn't know that

328
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,271
Out in the field under Denise and Robert

329
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
I

330
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
The students did a lot of watching

331
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
Many many photographs

332
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
So which were taken from

333
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,231
From reclusive millionaire Howard Hughes helicopter

334
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
He made available and always use

335
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
Leatherface helicopter

336
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,399
That was very useful because very good pictures

337
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
And with the nieces help

338
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:04,543
But students finagled their way into the grand opening Gala of the Circus Circus

339
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
Kiss Casino

340
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,127
And they had got themselves dressed up

341
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
They went to the thrift

342
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
Shop

343
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
In Las Vegas

344
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
In the midst of all the fun

345
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,087
The students were still really engaged with the labor

346
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
A truly looking at

347
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,463
Students observe traffic patterns conducted interviews

348
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
And made maps and diagrams

349
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,839
Basically all the things architecture students would normally do

350
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,143
To observe Athens or Rome

351
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
But

352
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,983
Like this time they were sitting in drawing sketches of parking lot

353
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
We had a set of topics

354
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,871
Many of them were patents of distribution like

355
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:45,759
Where are churches in Las Vegas compared with New Haven where our wedding chapel

356
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
People did distribution map

357
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
Denis compared the strip

358
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
To a Bazaar

359
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
Our Marketplace

360
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
Built on a scale for cars

361
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,255
The market is afoot Marcus and you Caesar

362
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,815
The actual Goods in the window of the

363
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,375
You smell them when you arrive on the market

364
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:07,775
Put on the Strip instead of the sights and smells of items for sale or the merchants hollering and peddling goods

365
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
There are signs

366
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
Call out infection to you

367
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:16,223
What's the anatomy of a big Las Vegas sign that has its high reader it slow reader

368
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
How does that feel

369
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
In relationship

370
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,343
Small side where all of them put on the side

371
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,415
How do they draw you in where do you see them from

372
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
And it observing the strip

373
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,511
And the way cars and people navigate it

374
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
They found that Las Vegas

375
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Worked

376
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,399
The sign served their purpose

377
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
Strip was navigable

378
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,775
It functioned in the midst of its apparent chaos

379
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,639
Like there would be an Arabian themed design for an Arabian themed Casino

380
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,479
And then use advertise the evenings performers in big lights

381
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,295
Everything was spelled out very clearly

382
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
In a way that was a

383
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Appealing to people

384
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
And so

385
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Robert Venturi

386
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Anthony Scott Brown

387
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
All the maps and notes

388
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
Observations

389
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
Today in the Student Center

390
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,911
And together but they're teaching assistant and co-author Stephen Eisenhower

391
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
They put it all

392
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
In a book

393
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,287
A book published in 1972

394
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
Cold learning from Las Vegas

395
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,895
What happens next everyone reads that book

396
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,711
This is architecture and design critic Alexandra Lange

397
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,039
And she says learning from Las Vegas challenged architects

398
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
To take the architecture of Vegas

399
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,415
What they called the architecture of the American Highway

400
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
Serious

401
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487
And that it too has a structure

402
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,303
And it too has lessons that we can learn from

403
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,119
And so let's stop being snobby and only

404
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:43,519
Kind of talking about architecture within architecture and look at what's actually out there in the world and what we can learn

405
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,383
It's not just saying hey Vegas is cool it's saying here's a whole approach

406
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
To the world that we actually live in

407
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,271
And truly everyone studying architecture read this book

408
00:16:54,527 --> 00:17:00,159
Why do they catch on because people were searching for a way out of the dead end

409
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
The dead end of modernism

410
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,047
And this book written by kind of the coolest kids in architecture

411
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
Seems like it might be that way out

412
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
By 1980

413
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:15,007
Learning from Las Vegas becomes a text assigned in every architect

414
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
Is that

415
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,639
Is a huge deal because it means American architects

416
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
Can't ignore

417
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,223
The built environment

418
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
That's all around

419
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,295
Although Venturi got most of the

420
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:33,439
The credit I never get the famous all it's Robert Venturi and what's that wife doing hanging in there

421
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,023
But learning from Las Vegas to Rives from Denise's

422
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
Experience on the strip

423
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,863
Which she then invited Venturi along for

424
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,679
Not to mention Denise's background in observation

425
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,007
Planning and her believe that spaces should be designed with

426
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:53,919
Digital architecture needed to say something to the maximum number of people not just two people

427
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,711
Who were educated

428
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,735
In the themes

429
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
Architecture

430
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,415
Venturian Scott Brown loved the historical elements of architecture that anyone could recognize

431
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,975
And so they say you know what

432
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,583
People love houses with Gables people like their Banks to have columns out front

433
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
So let

434
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Do that

435
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,935
Columns can signify that a building is important

436
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,239
Since they're associated with banks and government

437
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,567
Wrangler roof means that the building is a house

438
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,383
It was elements help people to understand the building

439
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,943
Architects should just go ahead and add them

440
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,759
Denise and Robert put some of these ideas into

441
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Practicing their own

442
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,135
One of the more extreme examples is their design for the Children's Museum of Houston

443
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,439
They put these oversized Greek

444
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Columns in the

445
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,511
Front with signal Night at the Museum

446
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,303
Because it's a children's museum

447
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
The Columns are Brite canary yellow

448
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:48,959
The Columns hold up on massive sign that says Museum in Big Red Letters

449
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
You don't have to wonder if you've made it to the right

450
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
It's pretty clear

451
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:58,175
And they did this for adult museums to freeze off of in Seattle Art Museum

452
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,015
A sign on the top of the building just says s a.m.

453
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
Seattle Art Museum

454
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
It is very big

455
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,927
I mean not all their buildings a giant overt signs on them

456
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,511
But the point is Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown we're not

457
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
Raid of signs

458
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
Do not afraid of color

459
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
No we're not afraid of

460
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,143
Historical motif

461
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
Their work

462
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,215
Inner architecture and writing

463
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:27,103
Is about making sure buildings were accessible and understandable to as many people as possible

464
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,943
And this morphed into one of the most controversial movements in architect

465
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Postmodern

466
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
Post-modernism

467
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,879
Buildings to be communicative deeply meaningful and fun

468
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,183
Although the problem is a lot of designers

469
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
Focus on the Fun Park

470
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,791
So some postmodern architecture

471
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Takes

472
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,351
Kind of the Jazz Inus

473
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
Vegas

474
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,191
Takes the colors take the Neon

475
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
That becomes one form of

476
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Post-modernism

477
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,079
A lot of Architects and designers were just like

478
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,919
Oh cool now we can use neon and bright colors and big science

479
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,503
Xiamen historical Styles and details

480
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
Just for the fun of it

481
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,343
In other words it became part of the ascetic

482
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
The 80s

483
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Bright colors

484
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
Gold shapes

485
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,999
This is what a lot of people mean by NF

486
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
Betika post-modernism

487
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
Just kind of goofy without substance

488
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,423
It goes in all of these different directions and I think

489
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,471
Denise Scott Brown really hate

490
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,055
Some of those directions because they don't have their interpretive

491
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
Quality.

492
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
They brought to their version of

493
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Modernism

494
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,455
Andaz postmodernism became sillier and

495
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Sillier

496
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:42,879
It strayed further and further away from what Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi were originally trying

497
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
Need to do

498
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:48,511
It became hard for clients to see how deeply intentional and thoughtful their work was

499
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:53,119
It wasn't like one Triumph to another after they wrote that book by any means

500
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
We probably

501
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,703
Had more work if we hadn't done all this

502
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,287
Their books they're building Champion places like the Las Vegas Strip

503
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,895
They're definitely times when they didn't have that many clients it was very difficult for them

504
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
To get work

505
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,271
Ultimately postmodernism's popularity was short-lived

506
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:16,672
What happened with post-modernism is it really did not last very long as an architectural movie

507
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
It has basically it

508
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Tenure

509
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
Approximately 10 year Heyday you can

510
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:26,144
And say kind of early 80s early 90s and then it just goes really out of fashion

511
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
Clients

512
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
Sort of revert back

513
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,520
Two wanting things that look modernist

514
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,800
And architecture

515
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
Revert back

516
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
To its previous form

517
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,432
People go back to wanting faceless building

518
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,224
In shades of grey and black

519
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
Made of glass

520
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
And if people want it

521
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:50,976
Las Vegas will deliver it

522
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,256
Eliza published

523
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:56,608
The book learning from Las Vegas and Las Vegas becomes known as

524
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,144
Maybe took the birthplace of

525
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
Postmodernism

526
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,776
Celebrating signage and moving away from

527
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
Boring modernism this is actually when

528
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
Las Vegas turn

529
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
To the opposite

530
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,200
As ever Vegas was ahead of the Curve

531
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,784
The strip had already started to revert to corporate modern

532
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,600
Even before learning from Las Vegas

533
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
Was published

534
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,440
In 1967 the state of Nevada passes

535
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
The corporate gaming

536
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,536
Which allows big corporations and hotel chains

537
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
To own and operate casinos

538
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,936
Became a casino operator but on the Las Vegas Strip

539
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
And they

540
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,544
Built following their own aesthetic which was

541
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,848
Corporate modernism and it was precisely this

542
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,384
Style of architecture.

543
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,712
Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi lamented

544
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
That's a big iron

545
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
Of course this isn't the end of the story

546
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,368
The strip after all he's always Reinventing

547
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,184
Responding to what consumers want

548
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,744
The big glossy Towers continue to rise

549
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
Until

550
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
1989

551
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,400
Steve Wynn's. A giant erupting volcano

552
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:06,240
In front of the Mirage Hotel

553
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,056
This brings in the Disneyland era

554
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,128
When Casino started to build a crazy expensive

555
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
Attractions

556
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:19,296
Treasure Island which had a big sinking pirate ship the big Cinderella Castle Excalibur

557
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,856
Let's call it vacationland

558
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,696
Fake Venice with fake canals and gondoliers who sing to you

559
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:31,584
Paris with a fake Eiffel Tower and then in the New Millennium Vegas welcome to a batch of new casinos

560
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,144
Designed by big-name prestigious architect

561
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:39,520
They're trying to appeal to Millennials by making Vegas look like a cutting-edge city

562
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
$15

563
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
And soon without a doubt

564
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,408
Strip will shapeshift again

565
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,200
This is all just to say

566
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,528
The Vegas Strip is in such a constant state of

567
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
Flux a renewal

568
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,928
Barely resembles a city that was chronicled in learning from Las Vegas

569
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,256
Almost Doesn't Matter that Vegas is

570
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Changed

571
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,864
Postmodernism is an architectural movement with a short one

572
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,960
Has Denise Scott Brown herself is often said

573
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
Learning from Las Vegas

574
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,800
Is not about Las Vegas

575
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,360
Use critic Alexander Lanigan

576
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,920
Is to use

577
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:21,760
The tools in the critical tools like they are writing as

578
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,552
Critics of the American landscape

579
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,392
To apply to your landscape your own situation

580
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
Learning from Las Vegas

581
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
Has helped Architects open their minds

582
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
Reserve judgment

583
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
And learn

584
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,632
From the everyday built environment around them

585
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,496
If you do want to observe the changing ever-shifting state of the American landscape

586
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,056
Still no better place to see it

587
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
Las Vegas Strip

588
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,920
Every time I go to Las Vegas I see something new and

589
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,504
If you if you want to stay ahead of the curve as an architect

590
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,552
It's good every now and then to

591
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
To visit Las Vegas

592
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,416
Denise Scott Brown went back to Vegas a few more times

593
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,208
When is many of these changes

594
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
But it's been awhile now

595
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
I haven't been there recent

596
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,376
And what items

597
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,192
From the Disneyland theme park

598
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,496
Arrow was that they were very talented

599
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
But you do

600
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:19,872
We have always turned on designing a casino that's was nothing

601
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
2.4 Oz

602
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
But don't say no one else does

603
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,528
Easy stir Damiano sauce that school celebrate

604
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,368
Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi are still together

605
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,928
And now they live back in Philadelphia

606
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,232
Just a 30-minute drive away

607
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,816
From the red brick Library designed by Frank Furness

608
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,376
A wonderful 19th century

609
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,168
Mannerist building

610
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
Chaba Thai

611
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,080
Regeneration just made it into the architecture Library Network dream of touching it now

612
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
In 1986

613
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,712
Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown worked on the master plan

614
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,760
The restoration of the Furnace Library

615
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
The very building

616
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
That brought their life

617
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
And their ideas

618
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Together

619
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:20,032
It's everyone's favorite architecture game duck or decorated shed

620
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Right after this

621
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,784
Between the beats

622
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,088
Bongs and Charter of our devices

623
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,672
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

624
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,304
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

625
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,192
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is in another room and we're all hearing.

626
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,984
Technology talk to us

627
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,288
It is a creation of Sonic trash

628
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,104
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

629
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,688
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

630
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
To make them more human

631
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
Turn the living room lights on

632
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Okay

633
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
Dim the living room lights to 50

634
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
80%

635
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
Okay

636
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,376
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

637
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,424
Makes for a much more natural

638
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
Experience

639
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Turn the living room lights on

640
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
Dim the living room lights to 50

641
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,104
Resent

642
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:33,760
We're presenting to special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

643
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
About how are sounds gay

644
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,832
Is impacting our health

645
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,136
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

646
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,208
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

647
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Right here

648
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,256
IPic

649
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,608
We need to talk about something

650
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,168
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

651
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:57,568
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

652
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:03,200
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

653
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
And you don't know why

654
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,784
Then it may be time to seek help

655
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,856
Go to oh my God. Info slide podcast

656
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:14,976
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

657
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
Oh my God. Info

658
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Flat pocket

659
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,864
We're back in the studio with Avery Drummond

660
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
With a little addendum

661
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,680
To be learning from Las Vegas tour

662
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,264
This is one really famous take away from learning from Las Vegas

663
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,056
We didn't cover in the story

664
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Because

665
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,128
Kind of eclipse is the rest of the book

666
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
Architects Tennessee

667
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,040
You had only one finding the dock on the Declaration shed we had 10 15 or 20 finding

668
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,344
And they have made to have ribs

669
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,904
The stuff well enough and learned how to use it

670
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
I'm one of those people

671
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
That

672
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,768
Love the concept of the duck versus the decorated shed

673
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
Just because as great name

674
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:54,400
I mean you can we can cut this out if we need to but

675
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:58,240
Should I give a shot of what I think it is and Vinny correct me

676
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,264
What's the definition of courage

677
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,312
Severe two types of building

678
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,592
There's a duck

679
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
Which is

680
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
A

681
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,736
Building with the form that represents the thing that's inside of it

682
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,320
And then there's decorated shed which is essentially a box

683
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,600
With a sign on

684
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,696
More or less

685
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:24,096
It gets so that's that it that is what it isn't Siri but then as you apply it to the real world if you look around looking for

686
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,120
Production decorated sheds

687
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:29,472
Yeah everytime I teach the deck in the decorated shed I have to

688
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,776
Think I'll and reread it and I profit

689
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
SRI Reddy

690
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
Strangely difficult

691
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:39,712
The design critic Alexander Wang is going to help us out a building that

692
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
Is a box

693
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,784
That could contain anything

694
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
And it has a sign out front

695
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
That indicates what happens

696
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,000
Inside so yeah pretty much a decoration that is pretty much what it sounds like

697
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
It's a simple

698
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,840
It's not a cereal box but it is a simple and generic building

699
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,888
With a sign or decoration on it

700
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,680
Like the Stardust Hotel

701
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,960
Which cities are staying at

702
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,776
That was a facade a mile long just

703
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
Blazing

704
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
Neon

705
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,872
And we woke drawn the back

706
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,176
I'm box at the back of this building is

707
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
Flawless decoration

708
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,528
Then Walter gropius ever dream job

709
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,064
And we call that the shed

710
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,160
So decorated sheds are actually quite common if you think of like a big box store

711
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,464
If it goes out of business in another business

712
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,488
They just changed

713
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,024
The sign and it

714
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
Completely functions

715
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,120
I think that the interesting thing

716
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,888
About

717
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,960
Learning from Las Vegas and Scott Brown inventories work

718
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,288
Is that what they're basically saying is like decorative Shades or not

719
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
A bad thing

720
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:41,664
That is one of the main points learning from Las Vegas is trying to prove that signs are really efficient

721
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:47,296
Way for building to communicate so we will getting this model of the shed for the place

722
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
But I was

723
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,600
Walking down

724
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,160
Architecture building

725
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,744
In New Haven and I looked up and I said you know

726
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,816
It's called No decoration but the whole thing is a piece of

727
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,584
Decoration

728
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
Which brings us to

729
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,192
The duck duck

730
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,008
So that's the idea of the whole building being a decoration

731
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
You know what

732
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Call Duck I don't

733
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,664
Does actually there's a famous building on the side of the road in Long Island

734
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
Literally shaped

735
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,480
Like a duck and it's old duck

736
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,016
And it's sold duck eggs

737
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,880
Of course it sounds awesome.

738
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,672
And it doesn't really matter what

739
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,488
The shape is inside this route for old activity

740
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:31,840
I guess I'll know that even if it's shaped like a duck a lot of buildings

741
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,400
Shaped like the very thing they're selling that's

742
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,168
Pretty rare

743
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,216
There's one outside of where I grew up

744
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,496
Which is one of the reasons why I know

745
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
It resonated with

746
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,544
What is it

747
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
In

748
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,664
I lived for a stretch of my childhood in Newark Ohio

749
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
And outside Newark Ohio

750
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
Is the

751
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,040
Starts with an L basket company

752
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,112
I don't know what it's called

753
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
They sold

754
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
Baskets and they had a building

755
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
A big picture

756
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,232
I'd like one of those

757
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,256
Rare like

758
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,792
Pure forms of duck

759
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,608
That's so cool but that's the interesting thing is like

760
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
Frank gehry building

761
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
Things can technically be.

762
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,520
Frank areas like mr.

763
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,568
Because those are

764
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
Statement buildings that are not

765
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:18,944
Decorated for sale if I don't have ornaments on them

766
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,296
But they are built out as an entire piece of decoration in and of themselves

767
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
Looks like with Gary has he

768
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
Crazy

769
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,648
Curved metal Exteriors

770
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,464
That forced the interior is to accommodate it

771
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,768
So it's it's kind of counterintuitive cuz you

772
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,584
Would be inclined to think while modern buildings are sheds

773
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
Because they're very minimalist

774
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:44,032
But yeah there's an argument to be made that a lot of modernist architecture was very preoccupied with making

775
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,360
What they called the heroic and original architects

776
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,896
People like Paul Rudolph

777
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
And the brutalist

778
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,200
Made a building

779
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
It looks like

780
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:56,064
Did all kinds of crazy things to try to express what it did

781
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
Inside

782
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,416
But actually often made in a room that were unusable

783
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,976
Balconies and nobody would ever hang out on

784
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,024
But that's not to say

785
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,816
That ducks are bad

786
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,608
Sunbathing should be.

787
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
You know

788
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:15,520
I was sunbathing should have ducked like parts of them but was inside is less important than the outside

789
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,616
Airport buildings that need something on them to make them

790
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,152
Show from the air

791
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,688
Edward helps out

792
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,784
Do that job special but they better have a big red checkerboard pattern feather

793
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
No plane will fly into

794
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,208
It's for a while when we went to give a lecture and you should be someone dressed like a duck on the stage with

795
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,792
Text pictures of nice sign of kind of something

796
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,096
So

797
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,888
I guess you're pretty much right

798
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,704
What do you think anything

799
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,752
It widened my scope of what a duck

800
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,800
I can see why

801
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,824
Even if your

802
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,384
Really smart like I was your delaying

803
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,944
Is way smarter about architecture then than me or

804
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,736
Anyone in the building

805
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,552
You would kind of have to look it up

806
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,088
Like his Maybe

807
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,624
The Apple

808
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Campus

809
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
IDOC

810
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
I mean I think there's a case to be made that

811
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
Are there any others

812
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,072
Edge cases that we could talk about

813
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,656
I kind of think like other hotels on the Las Vegas Strip you know

814
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Like

815
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,472
Some of them really walk that line I'm picking for

816
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,264
Particularly of like New York New York

817
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,288
Hotel which has this

818
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Play Books

819
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,872
Like the skyline of Manhattan

820
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
And I can't tell

821
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,736
If that is like

822
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:32,320
A front on a bunch of buildings you know it's hard to tell

823
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:37,440
What is the sign and what is the shape of the building when you get to the Vegas

824
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,536
And that mean the best form of nipples of both

825
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:54,080
I looked it up afterwards and it is the Longaberger Basket building that's in Newark Ohio

826
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
And it doesn't even look

827
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
Look like a giant picnic basket

828
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,480
It is no longer owned by the Longaberger company but

829
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
Fruit plants are

830
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,528
To preserve it

831
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,576
And all of its magnificent

832
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,856
Darkness

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

858
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,864
A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

859
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,424
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

860
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,960
That whines through a

861
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,752
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

862
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,288
We're looking the part

863
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,824
Might cost you your life

864
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:35,200
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

865
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,552
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

866
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:43,136
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

867
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
A dad

868
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,256
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

869
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,560
Actually if I'm being honest

870
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,608
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

871
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,960
A few days ago Wesley Stern

872
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,288
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

873
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,616
Was found dead in my private gym

874
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,944
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

875
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,296
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

876
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
Now

877
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,368
I need to clear my name

878
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,720
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do

879
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,768
Whatever it takes to find them

880
