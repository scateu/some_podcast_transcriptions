I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,008
Oprah Winfrey's hair is an amazing and ever-changing

24
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,544
Object of design

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,152
Quick Google image search of her and you can see it in a dozen different styles

26
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,456
But there's a consistency to

27
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
Brand familiarity

28
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,576
I'll give you took over his face out of all those Google Images

29
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,392
So that all you could see was a series of pictures of hair

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
You still know it was her

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,768
And even though she's done weaves and braids and all sorts of styles

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
She's also a natural

33
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,608
Meaning she doesn't use chemical relaxers

34
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
Try to straighten her hair

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,216
I'm not actually something over and I have in common

36
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,776
That's producer Lila Day from the stoop

37
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,360
Which is about stories from across the black diaspora

38
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,688
And since I'm white guy with very little hair

39
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,760
I'm actually going to hand this one entirely over to her now

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,112
Oppa gets most of the credit for her amazing natural hair

41
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
To one person

42
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:08,512
Andre Walker hair for 18 years and I've been through some really good styles

43
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
Add a couple of bad years

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,056
The same person who knows your hair doing it all the time

45
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,992
Andre Walker first saw Oprah on her talk show

46
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,040
Am Chicago back in the 80s

47
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
I thought she was fantastic

48
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
And I was watching her show every morning

49
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:40,512
And I thought you know I want to get to know her so I sent her some flowers one day

50
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,072
Saying I'm dying to get my hands in your hair

51
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
Please give me a call

52
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,936
He didn't have to do much convincing to get the job

53
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
She called me the next day

54
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,056
And I'm thinking oh my God that was easy

55
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,200
Andre travel the globe with Oprah as she became one of the most important media figures in the world

56
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,528
He gave her basically every hairstyle imaginable

57
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552

Huge afro wig

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,192
That was a very popular God I can go on and on and on

63
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,776
Puppy on Oprah's hair Andres known for something else

64
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,592
A system that he created back in the 90s

65
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,896
To Market his line of hair care products

66
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,968
The system categorizes natural hair types

67
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,528
And it's come to be known as the hair chart

68
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,112
Andre Walker hair takes your Nash

69
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,904
We've never gone for

70
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,744
The hair typing chart consist of for hair types

71
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,608
Within each of those categories there are different

72
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,632
Subtypes

73
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
Types one is for straight hair

74
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,288
Takes two is for wavy hair types

75
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
3 is 4

76
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
Curly hair and type 4 is

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
For kinky hair

78
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
Go for the goal

79
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
By Andre Walker

80
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:10,368
Revolution for Kinky-Curly and textured hair

81
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
Andres hair chart shows each type of hair drawn-out and labeled

82
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,095
From bigger loopy curls to super tight course

83
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,727
You can actually cut off a small piece of your hair and compare it to the drawings on the chart

84
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
To figure out which one you are

85
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
What's considered before B

86
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,383
So I'm on the kinky or end of a cross back chair

87
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,967
M4 Andre it was all about selling his products

88
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,623
If your hair is like this you buy this product if it's like that you buy this other one your hair will feels so moist and touch

89
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,671
Hatchable you don't know what to do with you

90
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
Obviously

91
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,863
I found Andres chart after I decided to go natural

92
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,983
Like a lot of black women I spent years putting chemical relaxers in my hair to straighten it

93
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,823
It actually never even occurred to me not to relax my hair

94
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,919
Until I was living in Cuba where relaxers were hard to come by

95
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
And so one day in Cuba

96
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,015
I just decided to do

97
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
The big

98
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
Chop

99
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
To cut my hair and let it grow back natural

100
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
It felt like a big deal

101
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,487
For a while I didn't even know how to manage it

102
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,583
Sometimes I felt frumpy with my short tight hair that I couldn't even come through

103
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399
I put on bright red lipstick and big hoop earrings

104
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,215
Anything to get through what some people call

105
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,495
The ugly face

106
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
All of this was a big change

107
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
Not just the hair but how people reacted to me

108
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,527
In Cuba I went from being called mulata which is more of a mixed girl

109
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
Negra which is black girl

110
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,135
I you look Negra now

111
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
But somehow I'm naked I didn't feel like a compliment

112
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
I felt pretty lost

113
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
So I turn to YouTube

114
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
To find a community of other Nacho

115
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,167

116

00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,511
Has gone Way Beyond his own line of hair care products

130
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,327
It's become the go-to way for many of us

131
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
I understand and talk about

132
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
I texturize my hair

133
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,983
But not everyone thinks Andres categories are a good thing

134
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,543
In fact I'm not sure they're good thing

135
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
But his chart

136
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,199
Has definitely got me thinking about a complicated relationship African Americans have with her hair

137
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
It's a complicated relationship

138
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
That goes way back

139
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:54,207
Thick kinky hair was considered a sign of health and wealth in parts of Africa

140
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
But in America

141
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
Skin tone and hair texture

142
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,351
Was used to divide enslaved African people

143
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,447
Light skin and straighter hair could mean more privileges

144
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
Like working in the house

145
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,263
And not in the field

146
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
This idea of good hair

147
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
And bad hair

148
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
All developed during slavery

149
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,991
Your hair was the closer it was too white textured hair

150
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
The better it was

151
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,343
Ayana Byrd is the co-author of hair story

152
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,903
Untangling the roots of black hair in America

153
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,975
And she says the common belief back then was

154
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,791
If you had straighter hair you probably had

155
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
More

156
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
White blood

157
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,399
Someone who didn't have straighter hair

158
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
After slavery ended

159
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
These racist beauty standards hang on

160
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
In the early 1900s

161
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,919
Some people try to straighten their hair by putting oil on it and then wrapping it with

162
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
Heated flannel

163
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,503
Mother's Reven wrapping their children's hair

164
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
I've been causing Burns

165
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
A lot of hair damage

166
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,415
Black churches in certain cities that would hang a column on the front door

167
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,511
And if your hair is you couldn't calm your hair with that then you couldn't worship

168
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
At that church

169
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
In the 1920s

170
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
Hot cam for used to treat in hair

171
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,191
And then came a hairstyle known as The Conch

172
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,799
You can see it on famous jazz musicians like Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington

173
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,615
The Conch was the name of the style

174
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,175
But it was also the name of the relaxer itself

175
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
Which was made with a harsh chemical

176
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
Cut sodium hydroxide

177
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Rely

178
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:28,671
And it's essentially just ate away at your hair and your scalp and cause a lot of serious Burns

179
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
And they were not safe

180
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
Some people made their own conch

181
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,631
Sometimes with two white potatoes and egg and Red Devil brand lye

182
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,703
A combo that left many Scouts bleeding

183
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
The conky eventually went out of style

184
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:49,663
But relaxers made with sodium hydroxide continued on and became more and more popular

185
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,247
The wash-and-set and under the dryer with a magazine

186
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
Became up very common image in Black salons

187
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
But then

188
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
In the 1960s

189
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,463
Something different started Rising

190
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,263
The Civil Rights Movement brought on the beginning of a new shift

191
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
It was all about embracing black

192
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,383
And this man embracing your natural hair

193
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,711
My mom aunties they all do the big chop

194
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,527
Heading out the relaxers and wearing their afros

195
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
Loud and proud

196
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,391
Does rabbit hear myself all of us were born without hair like this

197
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
And we just wear like this

198
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,279
This is an interview from 1968 with former Black Panther

199
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,095
Kathleen Cleaver

200
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,447
We're told that only white people were beautiful only straight hair light eyes

201
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Light skin

202
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
Beautiful

203
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
And so

204
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:52,383
Black women with try everything they could straighten their hair lightening skin to look as much like white women

205
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,783
Dickinson's changed because black people are where and

206
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,903
White people aware of the two because white people now one not perfect they won't wigs like this

207
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,511
Isn't it beautiful

208
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
Natural hair and afros were everywhere

209
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,263
From The Fluffy froze of the Jackson 5 to White celebrities like Barbra Streisand

210
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
Copying from

211
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,359
Was the first time that the relaxer industry

212
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
The chemical relaxer industry is really taking a hit

213
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
Financially

214
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,503
And not as many people were chemically

215
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
Straightening their hair

216
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
Instead of straighteners

217
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
For the first time people racing products that were meant to

218
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
The compliment their natural hair

219
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
Like Afro Sheen

220
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,767
Which gave the afro a bit more shine

221
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,327
I made it glisten like a Halo in the sunlight

222
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,407
Even if I froze continue to be an important Style

223
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
In the 1980s

224
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
A new chemical hairdo was on the rise

225
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Sexy

226
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
1 2 3

227
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,327
A Jheri curl created a bigger looser curl pattern

228
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,911
It was a turn away from the political statement of Afro

229
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
The Jheri curl

230
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,495
Was all about fun

231
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
So the ads really shifted away

232
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
I from having anything to do with

233
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:37,855
Black culture and community building and black identity and some more to just

234
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
Neon colors

235
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,695
Partying in Lake

236
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,279
All of the advertising for Jerry curls more about the 2nd Precinct

237
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
This fun

238
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
Ez2go Style

239
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,423
Although nothing about the Jheri curl was easy

240
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,239
Jerry curls were the most product

241
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Heavy

242
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
Hairstyle

243
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,431
That I think any people have ever known black people white people doesn't matter like to have a Jerry curl you had to have

244
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
All that activator in

245
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,807
It's so much stuff and you had to use it every single day

246
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
The Jheri curl was a very

247
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
Moisturize Style

248
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:17,535
The activator that you had to put in your hair everyday with drippy and greasy and your pillow would be

249
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Be stained with it

250
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
Wearing a shower cap in public was

251
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Fight normal

252
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
I know all of this

253
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
Because when I was a kid

254
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
I had one

255
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,991
When a Jerry curl fade it out regular old relaxers were still an option

256
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,575
And I went back to a relaxer to

257
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,439
Then in 2009 Comedian Chris Rock produced a documentary called

258
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
Good hair

259
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
After his daughter asked him

260
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,559
Daddy how come I don't have good hair

261
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,655
In the documentary he refers to chemical relaxers as creamy crack

262
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,495
Because they're applied in a white paste and even though they're toxic

263
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Some people

264
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Can't seem to

265
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Quit them

266
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
In one scene he shows just how harsh the chemicals found in many relaxers can be he needs help with this camera

267
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:13,855
Who demonstrates how sodium hydroxide can eat through just about anything

268
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
3 years

269
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
Skin the chicken is your skin

270
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
So it'll go from

271
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
My brown skin

272
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Down to the white meat

273
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
Right wow

274
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,143
Now you realize this goes in people's head start

275
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
Yeah people in black people

276
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
Black women

277
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Some men

278
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
Morris Day

279
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Prince

280
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,103
Put sodium hydroxide in their hair

281
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
To straighten it out

282
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
Why do they do that

283
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
Tulip White

284
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
You talked about UC

285
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
How is some head come in

286
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,743
Tighter than it may be like a 3/4

287
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,095
Do you mind

288
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,679
Got another Dingle Smith

289
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
And I'm with her and her Salon in Boston

290
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
Which amazingly is called

291
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Girlfriend

292
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
Hook me up salon

293
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,639
Everybody was saying girlfriend you hooked me

294
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
That's how I came up with

295
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,367
Smith tells me that even though the Chris Rock movie brought up some deep-rooted stuff that we need to talk about

296
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,439
It also did actually affect her business

297
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,279
People used to come in every 6 to 8 weeks to get relaxers

298
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:30,399
Some women would spend well over $1,000 a year on regular treatments in salon

299
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
I think the Chris Rock movie

300
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
Had an effect on all that

301
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
For a minute I was bad at a cousin

302
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,199
Why because it was affecting my money

303
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
Everybody

304
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
Started

305
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Going

306
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
You're mean so

307
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,207
Impact on me with me having chemical client

308
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,279
Goodnight and creamy crack

309
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:04,959
Today black consumer spending on relaxers is down 30% since 2011

310
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,287
And this brings us back to Andre Walker's hair chart

311
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
All of these newly natural people

312
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
I getting on YouTube for advice

313
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:18,783
I'm discovering the chart unbeknownst to me I was on the internet one day and

314
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Pence

315
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,415
List by reading some bloggers and they were referring to

316
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,743
Andre Walker hair typing system in like

317
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,559
Did I do that except the one I wrote about in my book

318
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,911
These days Oliver YouTube their people referencing Andres chart

319
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,495
Which remember categorizes hair from 1 to 4

320
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
When a being looser curls

321
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,847
M4c being the tightest

322
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,919
I'm just going to be braiding my hair

323
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
So I can get

324
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
My Afro

325
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
To be like rounded

326
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Into the front

327
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,135
Their videos on the best creams for a 4B twist out

328
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,463
Or how many times a week you should wash your 3B hair

329
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Order

330
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,047
Protective styles for your 4C hair

331
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,375
At first I found this all really helpful and positive

332
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,447
I mean it's great that more people are going natural

333
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,519
And it's great that there's a system to help them to do it

334
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:17,407
But then a few people started noticing that even in this new online community of natural

335
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,039
A lot of the videos were just reinforcing old bias about straighter hair being better

336
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,903
The videos often instruct women about how to go from very kinky hair to less kinky

337
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Straighter hair

338
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,023
So like from a 4C to 3B without using chemicals

339
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
But still implying that

340
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Straighter is better

341
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
Serenity hair like vest

342
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,447
Terminating a campaign

343
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
But you do see

344
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
Sophie bouncy curly hair

345
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
An old hag campaign

346
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,223
Are people that myself. You had that I literally cannot get my hand through it so I'll problem is unlocked

347
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
The same

348
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
We should be given room to speak

349
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
That's a plus one flower

350
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
A popular blogger

351
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,695
Who makes a lot of Straight Talk self-care types of videos

352
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
People like ourselves

353
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,815
You don't have hair that grows downwards our hair grows

354
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
Even if my hair

355
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,911
It feels the slumflower and others

356
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,215
Like online natural hair talk

357
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,799
Is mostly about how to transform what we have into something else

358
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
Something a little looser

359
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,919
That's not what our hair naturally does

360
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
And they're using Audrey's chart to do it

361
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,319
There has been a lot of criticism against a lot of natural hair websites

362
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:32,671
But they focus too much on quote-unquote 3B hair as opposed to 4C hair

363
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
And that the tighter

364
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
Your crawl

365
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:40,863
Pattern is and the kinky or your hair is the less represent it you are on the site

366
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:47,007
One woman I talked to said the chart feels to her like a modern-day pencil test

367
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,079
Which was a test used in apartheid South Africa

368
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,639
To figure out if someone was white or black

369
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,199
If you put a pencil in someone's hair

370
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
And the pencil fell out

371
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
The person passed

372
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
And was considered white

373
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:05,439
Skywalker says he just wanted to make a variety of products for different kinds of hair

374
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,511
It wasn't all his intention to create a hierarchy

375
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,071
People have asked me why did I label

376
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,887
Straight hair is number one in kinky hair is number

377
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,679
For I also asked him

378
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,983
But my answer to that is

379
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,335
It's going from zero texture to highly textured so going from one

380
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,407
Being straight to for being the kinkiest

381
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
And I've had people

382
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
That have been very sensitive about that

383
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
Because

384
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,159
They thought that I was given kinky hair

385
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Left

386
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
Important

387
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
By putting it in number four

388
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,839
And giving straight hair more important by being number one

389
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,679
But that just goes to show you how sensitive

390
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,983
You know hair is hair and texture is

391
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,031
You know for a lot of people

392
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
It's true

393
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,615
It's so so sensitive

394
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,687
And even though a lot more women are going natural

395
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,503
There are still so many who just don't want to

396
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,343
Maybe they like the way their hair look straightened or find it easier to manage

397
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,439
Or just don't want to deal with other people's reactions to their natural hair

398
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,559
Pocket girlfriend hooked me up hair salon event voice of some guy

399
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,399
Says she isn't the least bit concerned with Andres hair chart

400
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,191
Because she doesn't want to go natural

401
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
I don't know that

402
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Look

403
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,311
I feel is not for me

404
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,103
There's just this

405
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,895
Should I say fear

406
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Or discomfort

407
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,503
You know I'm not going to show up to an interview with braids

408
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
Or fro or anything like that

409
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,599
My hair is going to be

410
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,159
As straight as it possibly can be

411
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,695
Because as much as

412
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,999
I like it or don't like it

413
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,047
We still live in a society where

414
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,095
Our hair is not accepted

415
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,399
For what it is in

416
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
You have to

417
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
To play the game to win it

418
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
There is

419
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:00,895
So much racism and colorism and years of painful history Tangled Up in all of this

420
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
It's deeply personal

421
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,271
And for those of us who have decided to go natural

422
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,879
It would be nice to see the hair conversation shift away from how to change our hair

423
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,463
And more towards how to manage the natural texture we were born with

424
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
Because my hair

425
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
It's still a crown

426
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,863
No matter where on the chart I land

427
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,783
Clima de decodes The Proud Lady symbol

428
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
Right after this

429
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:51,839
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sand

430
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:57,727
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

431
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:03,615
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remembrall hearing that voice

432
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
Technology talk to us

433
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,711
It is a creation of Sonic trash

434
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,527
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

435
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:16,159
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology to make them more human

436
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
Turn the living room lights on

437
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
Okay

438
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
Dim the living room lights to 50%

439
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Okay

440
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:32,800
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

441
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,616
Makes for a much more natural experience

442
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
Turn the living room lights on

443
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
Dim the living room lights to 50

444
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784

The Proud Lady symbol

465
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
Is a symbol of this

466
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
Black woman

467
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112

Behind her and her head is how proud

469
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,024
And you can see the symbol on the back of some hair care products

470
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,144
And I actually grew up seeing symbol everywhere I just thought was part of you know

471
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,448
All the brands

472
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,240
But it's actually not that has a very sweet

473
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
Okay what's the point

474
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,848
There is an organization called the American Health and Beauty Athens

475
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:18,016
And they were founded in the 80s after a lot of black hair care products were kind of getting lost

476
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:22,624
Lost in the consumer Market they were big corporations like redlon and Johnson and Johnson

477
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,464
And they were sort of taking over the black hair care business so they created

478
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
The Proud Lady symbol

479
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,048
To let people know that it's a black owned business

480
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,888
Oh okay so what do you what do you have in your hand there

00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,848
Probability symbol right on the back near the barcode

483
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,432
And yeah it says and really tiny little writing what you said

484
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
If I can stay at

485
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,272
The Proud Lady 100% black owned

486
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
That's great

487
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,136
To this day do you look for that and

488
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:01,536
Make your choices based on that I never have you know and it was just doing this piece that I was like all that symbolize

489
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,864
I went to the hairdresser when I looked for it

490
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
Over and over and over and over again

491
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,984
And I only saw it on a couple of products and I also

492
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,616
I don't know if it's it's obviously not used as much as it used to be but I kind of missing that symbol

493
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,664

Series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

527
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,400
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

528
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,680
That whines through a

Might cost you your life

532
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:26,176
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

533
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:30,528
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

534
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,856
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

535
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
Adad

536
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,232
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

537
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:43,584
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

538
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
Nothing

539
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:51,008
