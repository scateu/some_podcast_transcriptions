I'm Roman Mars

27
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816
After the revolution in Cuba the young Fidel Castro hired an official photographer by the name of Alberto Cortez

28
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,632
Chronicle is New Life as a national leader

29
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:47,520
Cuda followed Castro and Che Guevara taking pictures of them as they met world leaders

30
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
Went fishing

31
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,592
Faced off in chess

32
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,920
He even took that iconic image of Che

33
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
The one that's on millions of t-shirt

34
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,504
That's comrade troubleman

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
My favourite images

36
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
That chord A captured

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,624
I have Che and Fidel playing golf

38
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,512
It was January 3rd 1961 two years after the revolution

39
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,560
When she suggested they go player

40
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,168
You know figure out what you know I don't play golf and Shay did play golf he's actually

41
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,240
Pretty good and he that keep it a caddy back in Chile

42
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
Helping us tell this story is

43
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
John Loomis

44
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:25,408
I'm John Lewis Simon architect and Architectural historian

45
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,552
To Che and Fidel drove out to what was the ritziest most elite Country Club in Havana

46
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:35,136
All of the members of the club they're practically have all left.

47
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:41,536
But still hear this amazing place the people who work here are still keeping everything clean and neat and taking care of it

48
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
And Che and Fidel romp around the bucolic Greenacres

49
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
In full military khaki in combat boots

50
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:54,592
Chase still wearing that beret

51
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,456
Golf club before putting around and grinning while Alberto Cortez snap publicity

52
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
And you know you look at the photographs and they're like Schoolboy just having fun and this was a lark and everybody

53
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Buddy thought this was

54
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
You know a real a real hoot

55
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,744
And the photos are actually beautiful

56
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,304
Because Cortez an incredible photographer

57
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
Also because the lens

58
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,264
There's a river running through all these gently undulating perfectly manicured Hills

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
Where to buy this

60
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
Thick Lush Forest

61
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
Kind of magic

62
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,224
Che and Fidel were captivated by this place

63
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,272
And they looked around and wonder

64
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,832
What should we do with this I know to the wonderful resource

65
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,904
It wasn't going to say a golf course that was for sure

66
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,976
And some say it was Fidel's idea other say it was Chase

67
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
But one of them turn to the other end

68
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
Playing his vision

69
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
The property

70
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
There they would build

71
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
In art school

72
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,192
An International School

73
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
For the Arts

74
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:58,592
That would draw students from all over the third world and bring them in Cuba and give them a n

75
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
First class

76
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,944
Art education and all the artist

77
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,808
A free of charge and a beautiful vision for a beautiful landscape

78
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Required

79
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
A beautiful building

80
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,952
Che and Fidel decided they wanted to build the most

81
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
Gorgeous art schools in the world

82
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,303
Something sitting with the newness

83
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Statement of the

84
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
Restrepo

85
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:27,007
Castro was recommended the young Cuban architect Ricardo porro and he knew that Ricardo was

86
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:32,383
Very very much supported the revolution had risked his own life

87
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
Arrowhead never

88
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Pick up a gun

89
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,247
And in addition to his commitment to the revolution

90
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
He was also really Talent

91
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
So he seemed like

92
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
The obvious person

93
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,487
Throw was told that if he wanted to design the schools he would have to do it almost immediately

94
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
Did you have to

95
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
In the projects

96
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
In 2 months to begin because

97
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
Structure message message

98
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,495
This is footage of Ricardo porro in 2004

99
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
Porto passed away in 2014

100
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,359
Or I was told that's it two months for the designs

101
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
You take it or you leave it

102
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
And I remember a sizable

103
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
Ricardo what do you send me sister

104
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,271
You're not going to take you know

105
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
You say I take it I take it

106
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,159
Naviance School wasn't just one school

107
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,207
It was imagined as an entire campus

108
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,791
Five separate schools for five distinct disciplines

109
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
Ballet modern dance

110
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Visual Arts

111
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Music

112
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
And theater

113
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,935
Ricardo Pereira was going to need some

114
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
He recruited to architect

115
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Italian

116
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
Victoria Gotti and Roberto guitar

117
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
Oh and in addition to the time for lunch

118
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
There was the Embargo

119
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,271
Already with the Embargo importing concrete and rebar was

120
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Very

121
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,343
They had to use what they had

122
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,647
The 3 Architects decided to build with

123
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
Locally-made brick

124
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
And terracotta tiles

125
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,071
And with these tiles they decided to make schools comprised of Catalan vault

126
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,167
McAllen bald is essentially a dome made of layer tile

127
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,471
And it's called the Catalan Vault because it's

128
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
Predominantly used in Catalonia

129
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
Especially Barcelona

130
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,103
It was adopted pratiksha

131
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,431
By Gaudi to do these very organic

132
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:15,807
Forms and so with the unifying element of brick and unified style of Catalan vault

133
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,927
The 3 Architects viento erected their separate designs around the edges of the golf course

134
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,023
Okay I'm going to throw journalistic impartiality to the wind here

135
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
These buildings are

136
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
So

137
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Beautiful

138
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
Each uses the vault in a completely different way

139
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,263
And they all roll over the landscape of a golf course

140
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
And mixed with a

141
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
Plants in the palm trees

142
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,383
Winding Thunderman Furlan titties

143
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
Plazas and courtyards

144
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,247
And the curving rooftops with all those vaults make them look

145
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
Alive

146
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Dancing

147
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
Every school has a clerestory to

148
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
What does very intentional symbolize

149
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
But poro School of Visual Art was the most literal imagine the School of Visual Arts or they called it

150
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
School of plastic Arts

151
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:06,751
As a building that would nurture art and artists and helped give rise to a uniquely post-revolution Cube

152
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Ben aesthetic

153
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,103
The school was going to give birth

154
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,919
So I try to make the school

155
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
Plastic art

156
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,015
Has the image of a goddess of fertility

157
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
So I put a lot

158
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
Of breast

159
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,415
Indicated in the domes

160
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,743
No really the Volta Jones have these nipples on them

161
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,815
And there was a special fountain in the main Piazza

162
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,399
Linda Piazza I place a sculpture ideas

163
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,239
Just like a fruit called papaya

164
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Chuba

165
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Assist

166
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,591
Sexual feminine connotation

167
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,175
Some higher-ups found this pretty scandalous

168
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,991
I was told to turn the water in the fountain off

169
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:54,367
Yes you have. Brass and here you have the papaya which is a metaphor for

170
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
But everybody knows them

171
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
The Caribbean

172
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:02,047
But I think that it's wrong to overemphasize that

173
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
Because really

174
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,143
John Loomis says that the school is a commentary

175
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
Incubus past

176
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
And Future

177
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,751
As you're walking down those curved passageways

178
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,847
You can't see where you've been and you can't see where you're going

179
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:20,223
I'm in way that was a metaphor for this new chapter in Cuba you know this is a new

180
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Adventure

181
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
This new Revolution

182
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,927
The Revolutionary Spirit was the driving force of the design and the canoe

183
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Construction

184
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
Decathlon Vault required a lot of Labor

185
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,351
So there's this massive crew of young Cuban workers on the golf course

186
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
Making me structure

187
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:44,031
Goldwork is felt a real buying because they felt that they were building the school that their children could potentially go to

188
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
But previously they have no hope

189
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,127
Liquor children would go to University Art to an art school

190
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:53,759
And this endeavor was so exciting but the school is basically opened while they were still being built

191
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,855
At some point when construction began that they said well let's just use the space

192
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,927
The country club was already there with its meeting rooms and ballrooms

193
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,999
Of course they had those manicured grounds and the beautiful weather

194
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
Ballerinas pirouette on the putting green

195
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,143
Interceptor canvases in the shade

196
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
Practiced in the forest

197
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,775
And students brought water and drinks and food for the construction workers

198
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
And play drums to keep their spirits up

199
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
It was as beautiful joyous Undertaker

200
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Except when it was

201
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
During that time

202
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,551
And still today it's difficult to talk about

203
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
The negative

204
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Aspects of

205
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
The revolution

206
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
So people really focused on

207
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
The joyous part and the optimism

208
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,535
You know cuz that's what he hold on to

209
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
Weight when you're in this land of paradox

210
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
Alyssa nahmias co-produced

211
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,423
The documentary about the Cuban Arts

212
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
In Cuba

213
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,031
At the same time for example as artists were

214
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
Having drum parties to finish

215
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
The the buildings

216
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,759
Well the Masons were working and it was very beautiful and fun and joyous there were other students who were

217
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Sent to labor camps

218
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
Because they were homosexual

219
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Or religious

220
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,647
Or in other ways anti-revolutionary

221
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,719
Even before this agricultural labor camp

222
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
UPS opened in 1960

223
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
C5

224
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,071
The anti-revolutionary students were

225
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
Expelled from the art school

226
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,447
Ricardo porro continue to give them classes in his home

227
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,823
Broken feel that the values of the Revolution we're shifting as he says in the documentary

228
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
I used to tell

229
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
The other actor

230
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Don't lose

231
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
Your time

232
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
Making small details

233
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
Try to do

234
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Sings

235
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Flask

236
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,647
Because perhaps one day it's going to be

237
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:42,559
After the Missile Crisis after the Bay of Pigs military defense was given a much higher priority than say

238
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,887
Creating the most beautiful art schools in the world

239
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
So there was the money issue

240
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,471
But also generally

241
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,311
Cuba was starting to imitate the Soviet Union in more and more ways

242
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:59,967
I made it very individual architecture and they wanted Soviet architecture

243
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,039
Blocky functional uniform one-size-fits-all

244
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
Completely the opposite

245
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,159
Of the sensuous organic malts and curves

246
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
Of the arts schools

247
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
There was an idea that

248
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,559
The designs for the Cuban national art schools were

249
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
Extravagant for

250
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
A socialist Revolution

251
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
That had to tighten its belt

252
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,799
And what are the earliest proponents of that argument was Roberto secretary

253
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,127
Roberto segret was the architecture critic

254
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
Like really he was the only one

255
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
He had tremendous influence

256
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,063
Cigarette was not a fan of the breasts and the papaya fountain

257
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,903
I segway himself says in the film

258
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,463
I like the connection

259
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,535
These days cigarette admits that he was a bit harsh

260
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
Now segree will say that

261
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
He really didn't want to write those things

262
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
But he was

263
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
Under constraints

264
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
My people higher up

265
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
Mostly Antonio King

266
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,103
Antonio Quintana was the last of a generation of established

267
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
Cuban architect

268
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,015
All his contemporaries had fled During the Revolution and this left Quintana at the top of his field by default

269
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
He wanted it to

270
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Stay that way

271
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
Quintana clearly had a

272
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
Personal

273
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
Desire not to

274
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
See Ricardo plural

275
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Drivers Market

276
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,607
Cuba architecture Quintana and the critic Roberto Sekirei helped

277
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,399
Turn favored against the schools

278
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,799
Workers were slowly reduce the amount of workers portals buildings were far enough finished so they were really

279
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Able to be brought

280
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
To the finish line or very very very

281
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,711
Close but the schools designed by the other two architects were not so lucky

282
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,527
The theater school was only 30% complete

283
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,367
The music school was also in finished but had a few usable room

284
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
The most unfinished

285
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
Was the ballet school

286
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
Which didn't have floorboard

287
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Glass in the windows

288
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,423
All the materials were there and it could have been finished in like 15 days and the lead of the Cuban ballet

289
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,751
Alicia Alonso is a very famous Cuban ballerina

290
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:05,151
She visited the site I don't like it no more

291
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
And that was that

292
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,295
The Cuban ballet opted for a much more centrally-located Studio

293
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,855
And in July of 1965

294
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
The schools were just

295
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Declared finish

296
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,463
In all their varying states of completion

297
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
They had an opening

298
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,071
Declared them open and they were used in the state that they were

299
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:28,447
Even the unfinished ballet school was used very briefly as a Russian circus School

300
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:32,543
The Architects were scattered to different jobs within the ministry of construction

301
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
Ricardo porro

302
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,663
Started working directly under Antonio Quintana

303
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
That last of the Old Guard Arkansas

304
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
Corazon Amazon

305
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
Quintana

306
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,623
Gave him very demeaning jobs he gave him the job to design a cage

307
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
Pretty girl

308
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
In the zoo

309
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
Oh my God

310
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:55,071
I couldn't work anymore in my architectural I have got to do all four fingers they wear doing

311
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,607
And I decided to leave

312
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,727
In 1966 parole left Cuba and move to Paris

313
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,775
And as for the schools themselves

314
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
The crazy thing is that they never close

315
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
Even during some horrible spells in Cuba's history

316
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
When entire family is where

317
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
Squatting in the rundown parts of the school

318
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
And ransacking them for materials

319
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
Classes have always

320
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,439
Continued well except for the ballet school where the classes that require started

321
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,279
But the other four arts schools continue to be among the finest in the world

322
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,839
Although they are not as big as they were meant to be

323
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
And they're pretty run down and some parts

324
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,447
If Bloods like the first time I went there

325
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,031
There was a guy playing drums but I think there was like a foot of water

326
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
In the building

327
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,383
Today the schools are known as is

328
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
A

329
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
Isa you saw what it's called now

330
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
The

331
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,295
Instituto Superior de Arte

332
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
So now I'm going to come yell at us

333
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
Especially

334
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,023
On the dead rain nobody's going to come

335
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:03,423
The schools with students have guard course but Philippe Dells itis showed Avery the abandoned ballet school

336
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,495
How many times I haven't seen any security guard

337
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
WeChat

338
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,127
Now that is a graffiti and things happening

339
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
There.

340
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Columbia

341
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
Sometimes you one day security

342
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
To be there

343
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,111
Felipe is a multimedia artist who once studied at the theaters

344
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,951
Back Down The Unfinished ballet school was a mysterious ruin

345
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,767
Graco swing is totally here

346
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
K&D 80s

347
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,351
The whole thing here with a jungle

348
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:37,215
Students would go there and party and stuff

349
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
It was a great play

350
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
Kaboom

351
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,823
He didn't know the story of the buildings

352
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
No one really dead

353
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,431
The story of this is Boudoir session how I get taboo

354
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
Spokane never discuss

355
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
What's the weather like

356
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
Secrecion

357
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
But then John Loomis

358
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,903
Who we've been talking to throughout this episode

359
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
Published his book about

360
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,743
The school's called revolution of form

361
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,559
Revolution of forms came out in

362
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
March of 1999

363
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
And through revolution of forms

364
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,703
Philippe finally learn the story of this

365
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Place where he at

366
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,263
Studied for five years

367
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
This Israeli

368
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Changsha

369
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
