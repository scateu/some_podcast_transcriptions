A stamp is not a tiny painting

30
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,416

36

But there are so many other stamps made every year what about those abstract expressionist stamps that were all sorts of awkward so

47
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,824
Are the Muppets that were on a white background and seemed to be bursting out of the envelope

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
And those new pioneers of industrial design stamps

49
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
Oh my goodness and I love the cloud stamps

50
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,040
If you looked at the sheet there laid out in the exact same layers they see

51
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808

00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
Just that you don't really see those ones you just

56
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
See the flag

57

Dems take on average a year to a year-and-a-half from conception to execution

59
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,520
I can just tell you that this process is never cease

60
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
Basically the art directors

61
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,384
Pull together the stamps once the subject matter has been

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,456
A dimension it's a long process

63
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,552
It starts with public suggestions for stamp subject in mail to the US

64
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,416
Yes stamp proposals must be submitted in writing

65
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
Visa stamp

66
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:48,096

50000 suggestions

74
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
Is a year

75
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
That

76
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
Come in from the America

77
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
Public

78
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
Basically all of those

79
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
Subject

80
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Suggestions

81
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,976
Have to be gone through and have to be reviewed

82
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
By a committee

83
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,607
The committee is called the citizens stamp advisory committee

84
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,143
For short csac

85
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
And that committee

86
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,239
Serves the Postmaster General

87
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,311
As you might imagine sesac has received some pretty

88
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
The far-out suggestions over the years

89
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,175
We've received requests for hate stamps

90
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
To combat the love stamps that we should

91
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Every year

92
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,575
One for the devil one for the passing of

93
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,111
Great American outhouse

94
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,951
But luckily there are rules that help guide the committee and choosing the stamps up

95
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:51,583
About a dozen Rolls by primarily feature Americans anniversary significant contributions

96
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,191
Dead Presidents usually get a stamp 50th anniversary of historical events

97
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Statehood

98
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,615
No repeats within 50 years accepting National symbols and holidays of University founding

99
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
No disasters commemorated

100
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
Keep away from religion of course

101
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:14,111
Christmas and there been a few people such as Mother Teresa but we're really honoring her for her humanitarian

102
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
Not for her religious orders of religion

103
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,071
And this one is interesting themes of widespread appeal that reflect the USA's inclusiveness in other words

104
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
Something everyone will love

105
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:30,239
To be bold and controversial is not what stamp makers are going for what you think you could do critically to

106
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,591
Although you know inclusive this itself could be viewed as a radical notion this on

107
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
But there's one more big roles

108
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
I'll get to that in a minute

109
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
The citizens stamp advisory committee follows the

110
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
Trolls pics the subject

111
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,855
Friends and by the Postmaster General you know the grand poobah of the u.s.

112
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,415
If he's not in favor of a stamp

113
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
It isn't going anywhere

114
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
But I think he

115
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
He usually defers to

116
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
And assigns them to the art director

117
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,375
And then the art directors follow their own rules

118
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
And the number one thing

119
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:05,311
Keep in mind around the stamp Services office courtesy one of the art directors Howard Payne was Tookie

120
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
Keep it simple and look at it

121
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
At stamp size

122
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
But the art directors also consider a few other

123
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,223
Keeping a bright and colorful and

124
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
Engaging and making the image

125
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,367
Something that people will want to put on their envelopes

126
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:24,767
What's the feeling you want to evoke what emotions do you want to evoke the social awareness stamps this week

127
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
Purdue them are the most difficult stamps

128
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
Reduce because you have to

129
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,423
Create an abstract concept and sell it to them

130
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,007
Public wildly successful in this

131
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,823
Both Terry and Ethel sided independently

132
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,663
The first stamp that I have to mention your card for many reasons

133
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,247
It also happened to be the first stamp that was issued that I

134
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
Are corrected

135
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Was a breast cancer stamp

136
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Not only is it a

137
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,903
Great graphic design and illustration

138
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
But it also is a fabulous message stamp

139
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,791
And that stamp was also the first time in the country

140
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,863
That the US did a stamp that raise money

141
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
For cause

142
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
In addition

143
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
2

144
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
The post

145
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
Because you pay an extra $0.08 on the

146
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Average

147
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
To purchase

148
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Which one of the stand

149
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Zach stamp

150
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
Which went on sale in 1990

151
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
8

152
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
And it's still on sale

153
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
After all these years

154
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
And it's raised

155
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
About 70

156
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
3 million

157
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
For brest

158
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
Just looking at the stamp

159
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
From the lower left to the upper right

160
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
It goes from dark colors

161
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
Into bright colors

162
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
Layered with

163
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
A line drawing of

164
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
The Goddess Diana

165
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
Reaching over her shoulder

166
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
To reach

167
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
Or an arrow in your quiver

168
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:49,503
Which also has an ingenious resemblance to the line drawing cartoons from those doctors office pamphlets that

169
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,551
Explain how to give a self breast exam

170
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
Where are one beer

171
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,647
Breast would have been there

172
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
They have removed that and

173
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Put in a slogan

174
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
Panda fight

175
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
Find a cure

176
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,607
It was a brilliant design

177
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,423
But not all social awareness stamps are wildly

178
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,079
I think one of the biggest examples of a stamp gone wrong as many years ago before I join the group there was a stamp

179
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
Stamp Out alcoholism

180
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,967
But unfortunately it was one of the biggest failures we ever had because

181
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
When the message

182
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
It was sent to

183
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,087
Another person that person received it and

184
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,415
Got the impression that the sender was saying you're an alcoholic

185
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
You need help

186
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
And I had a phone that a friend service

187
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
That's tempting

188
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Not work

189
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:41,215
A technology pulls us deeper into electronic correspondence and away from snail mail

190
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
By the way the USPS

191
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
Has lost billions

192
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
The dollars

193
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
But it's trying to keep

194
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
Keep up and stay relevant

195
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,967
To that end in the fall of 2011 they changed one of the biggest rules governing stamp subject selection

196
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
It used to be that

197
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
First you have to be dead longer

198
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
To be honest app

199
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,159
And there were lots of reasons for that

200
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,231
In the beginning it was they have to be dead 10 years

201
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
They shifted that.

202
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
The five

203
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
And as most people know

204
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,375
They've just shifted that to even living people can be on

205
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
Stamps

206
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
Now you have to start looking and saying

207
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
Who's the first one

208
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,079
I had a feeling Terry knew the answer to that one

209
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
Yes I do

210
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
But I'm not at Liberty to say

211
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,039
It will not be Lady Gaga

212
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,855
Seat when the USPS change the deceased

213
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,159
Subject rule to allow living people on stamps

214
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,487
They asked the public to nominate someone for the first living Sam

215
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,047
Tragically nominations were accepted online

216
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
No stamps required

217
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,167
And besides Bob Dylan at the time living Steve Jobs

218
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,983
Lady Gaga was right there near the top of the list

219
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,287
Well you get what you ask for

220
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
Not that Lady Gaga's bad II

221
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
I love her music

222
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
Aprima chargepoint around

223
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:01,087
Miss open call for the first living person I see I can view it as kind of a gimmick to get people excited about

224
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
The post office in

225
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,927
Get Lady Gaga fans to buy stamps

226
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,999
It will not be Lady Gaga

227
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
For the people who design stamps

228
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
Sure they want you to buy it

229
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,143
But when you talk to them immediately you know

230
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
It's so much more to it to them in the

231
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
SFO puts it

232
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
Story of America

233
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
In pictures

234
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
You work on these things

235
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
So

236
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Long

237
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
And put so much into

238
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
Heart and soul

239
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
That

240
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
Feel like in the end it has to be right

241
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
It's for the American public we vets

242
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
You know that's who we're doing this for

243
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
And

244
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
I just wanted to be right

245
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,119
It's something that touches every person in your

246
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
United States and its

247
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Product

248
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
That I helped

249
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Tamia

250
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
Wonderful

251
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
Undertow been part of

252
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
LPS

253
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,759
$0.45

254
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
The current rate for a first class stamp

255
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,879
Is an entirely reasonable amount

256
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,207
Tiny work of art that escorts your letter all the way across the country

257
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
I completely agree for $0.45

258
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
I wouldn't take your letter

259
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
Stairs

260
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
I'm going there anyway

261
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Selection

262
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
13

263
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,239
Postal workers cancelling stamps

And Facebook sharing and ratings and reviews on iTunes there so amazing you are the entirety of

286

But I I just appreciate everything you've done so far so thanks so much

289
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
And dumb

290
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,095
All right I'm getting dangerously close down a thousand ratings on iTunes

291
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:29,215

Thanks

295
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,303
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

296
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
The body genius is a dark

297
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Comic mystery

298
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,703
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

299
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
We're looking the part

300
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
Might cost you your life

301
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:40,895
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

302
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:45,247
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

303
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,599
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

304
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,951
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

305
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
Actually if I'm being honest

306
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of thing a few days ago Wesley Stern

307
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,983
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

308
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,311
Was found dead in my private gym

309
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:15,711
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had some

310
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,015
Nothing to do with it now

311
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
I need to clear my name

312
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,463
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

313
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:33,375
Final episode of the body genius drops on May 30th Bend all 5 parts
