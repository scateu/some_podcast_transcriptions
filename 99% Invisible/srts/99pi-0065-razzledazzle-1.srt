This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars

20
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,984
I think if you ask somebody on the street

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,080
What is camouflage I believe most

22
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,128
Common answer would be so well

23
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,664
It is a figure

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,248
And it's being blended with its background

25
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:30,368
The scientist today call that background matching by similarity camouflage

26
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
Let's Roy Baron Barons and I teach in the department of art at the University of Northern Iowa I teach graphic

27
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,352
Design and the history of design is also one of the foremost

28
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
Camouflage expert

29
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,656
Swell

30
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,472
I wouldn't go that far. What I do

31
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,312
Item molarity or blending is just one type of camouflage

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Kind of boring one

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,200
But another type of camouflage that you can find both in nature and in military use

34
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
It's disruptive camo

35
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
Figure disruption

36
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
Raptor options

37
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,440
Breaks up the figure

38
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,024
It's the opposite of high similar to camouflage it's high differ

39
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
So you're making it

40
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Very difficult

41
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,656
For us to look at the figure and to see it as

42
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
Only a single

43
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,520
Continuous thing ruption drops

44
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,872
Zebra stripes have long been thought to be a form of disruptive

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Stripes

46
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,992
Make it hard for a predator to distinguish one zebra from another

47
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,296
When the zebras are in a large herd

48
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,344
Botrytis might also makes me Breathless

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Attractive to bloodsucker

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
Horsefly

51
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
But when it comes to humans

52
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
The greatest

53
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,024
Most jaw-droppingly

54
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,632
Angular application of disruptive camouflage by the military

55
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
Is Razzle Dazzle

56
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,640
Camouflage

57
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
Strictly applies to ship camouflage and even more strictly it applies to World War 1

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,648
And it came about because it was discovered

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
It's

60
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,720
Almost impossible to make a ship

61
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
Invisible

62
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
On the ocean

63
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,144
The Horizon is changing in color it's changing

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
Amount of light

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,824
So they're all kinds of conditions that make its way constantly moving ship can't blend into the background

66
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Odyssey

67
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
And even if you could make a ship invisible you still have smoke coming out of smokestack so it's not as if your

68
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
Hiding ship it all

69
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,600
To the less heavily armored ships were sitting ducks

70
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
The crisis came about at the time that the US had not yet entered the war remember this is World War 1

71
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
It was the British ships

72
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
That were being sunk and

73
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,656
The German submarines were sinking as many as

74
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
50 ships

75
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
A week

76
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,520
Naval ships were Merchant ships

77
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
And they were

78
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
Bringing supplies

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
2

80
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,456
Which is an island of course send

81
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,760
It really depended on those and then also there was

82
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,576
Armaments and other things that were being secretly taken there

83
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Where to

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,416
So the design solution was not about invisibility

85
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
It was about disruption

86
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:19,327
A number of artists decided that the best way to avoid getting torpedoed

87
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
Was not to make the ship invisible

88
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
But to make it

89
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
Hard to hit

90
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
That's why

91
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
These kind of erratic

92
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,871
Crazy quilt patterns came about and that's why they were used in that war

93
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
It's going to be hard at pictures

94
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
Best but I'm waiting to try

95
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,015
There was a time when military ships

96
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Steven us ships by this

97
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Pour painting

98
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
With an i

99
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
Quote

100
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,487
This is from an anonymous article in New York Times from 1980

101
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,607
Any New Yorker will see a tanker or coming in or going out

102
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
Numerous ships

103
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,215
Who's painted signs reveal such Wild extravagances

104
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
A form and color

105
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,567
And make the landsman open his eyes

106
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
With amazement

107
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
And mystification

108
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,455
Black and white was very common they consist of

109
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,807
Stripes and Swirls and kind of Arabesque almost Art Nouveau shapes

110
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Blue

111
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Was

112
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,183
Use predominantly especially in the British versions

113
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,487
But I think you'd be surprised

114
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,631
The range of colors there were Reds that were Sometimes using greens and really quite intense oranges

115
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,935
Another on identified you as journalist Road

116
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
You should see our Fleet

117
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,775
It's camouflage so it looks like a flock

118
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
Seagoing Easter eggs

119
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
During World War 1

120
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,919
Dazzle ship camouflage with absolutely

121
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
Fascinating to the public

122
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
You have to remember that this is happening

123
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,831
Just a few years after the

124
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,671
What's called The Armory show in New York it's the first

125
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,743
International show of Modern Art

126
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
In this country

127
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
And it was the introductory show up

128
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
Cubism futurism

129
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
All of those things that

130
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,471
People make fun of and they thought

131
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,287
Good universities are really crazy directions for artists to be going in

132
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
When this happened

133
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
People looked at those ships and they said

134
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,943
Succubus nightmare

135
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,991
Futuristic

136
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,087
As you can probably guess they were plenty of people

137
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
Who hated Dazzle camouflage

138
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,695
Traditional Navy men most

139
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,303
So they compared it to the clothing it up prostitute would wear and they make fun of it

140
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
Here's how it work

141
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
The steps

142
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,751
At the time Torpedoes fired from U-boats were quite slow maybe taking a couple minutes

143
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,335
To reach their target so the person firing the torpedo

144
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,871
Had to lead the target

145
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
He had to anticipate

146
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,223
Where the target ship was going to be

147
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,271
When the torpedo arrive

148
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,087
So we had to calculate how to do that in that

149
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
During which depended on knowing

150
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,951
The exact angle it's it's headed toward

151
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
That's terribly terribly bored

152
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,559
And the other thing is that you have to figure out

153
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
The speed

154
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
Of the ship

155
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
Because then you'll know

156
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,959
How far to go by the time the torpedo

157
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
The Dazzle camouflage certainly made the ship

158
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Stand out

159
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,615
But they're bulging shapes and Vivid hues

160
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,919
Also made it difficult to determine the

161
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,991
Speed and direction of the moving ship

162
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,551
It's praying on our assumptions about

163
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
Things

164
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,135
Looking smaller as they are more distant

165
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,975
So you could paint perspective patterns on a ship

166
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
That would make it look like it was

167
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Turning

168
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:35,167
Is a different direction when in fact that you're actually seeing them frontally and they're absolutely flat

169
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
Bedazzled patterns

170
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
Broke up to figure

171
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,031
So that I can look shorter than it really was

172
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,871
Or I can make it hard to tell if there is one shift for multiple ships

173
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
But even painted

174
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
Fake ball waves on them

175
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
And they would paint the

176
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
Fake bow wave

177
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
Either on the front

178
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,343
To make it look like the ship was going fast

179
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
What's actually going

180
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
Cuz that was one way of calculating

181
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,743
Or fish would

182
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
Paint the bow wave

183
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
On the back

184
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
And so you would glance at it

185
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
Why you looking through this Periscope you might conclude that

186
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,191
Going in that direction

187

Gone it's an entirely different direction and location than you imagined

192
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:25,855
These patterns were just slapped on the side of giant ships hoping that they'd be confusing enough to be effective

Square pointed

202
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
They determined that

A torpedo

212
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
The theater of war has changed

213
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
So camouflage has changed with

214
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,679
But there is still dazzled to be found

215
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,519
Actually if you look at military crafts

216
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287

00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
There is still dazzled in Pratt

00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
But of course the conditions of change

219
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,943
Just as a World War

220
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,039
This came out of those particular set of conditions we have to say

221
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,623
Well those are the conditions that we have now so what would be most effective
