00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
Definitely dystopian and he needed

He did it for like

Design world

82
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,128
And for many years there's been something called

83
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
Communication design

84
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
Which may be before used to

85
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
Call graphic

86
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
Which is the design of messages

87
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
Just Beat It

88
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
Advertising

89
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
I just sign it

90
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
So it's exist

91
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
That's design

92
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Who subject

93
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
Is communa

94
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
But right now

95
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,048
The difference is that

96
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
Even Furniture Design

97
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
Nurse need to understand

98
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,168
That a Chad might need

99
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,984
To have some kind of conversation with

100
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
With people

101
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,056
There was a talking chair in

102
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,128
Michelle

103
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,664
We can talk you can sing

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
And talking

105
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Toys

106
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Talking Maps

107
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,040
But they were also ATMs and Subway kiosk

108
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
According to Paola Antonelli

109
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
Cutting-edge communication design

110
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
Is all about

111
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
The interface

112
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,744
When you say interface you can take out the face and

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,303
Section you can take out section and

114
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
Relation to me

115
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
One of these

116
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Focal

117
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Points

118
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Of the way

119
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
Will look today

120
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
The wave

121
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,823
Paola Antonelli says designers under

122
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
Understand the interface

123
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,687
Between people and objects better than say science fiction writers

124
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
Because what they're really working on

125
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
Is the interface with

126
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
People and

127
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,879
One of the pieces she put in her show with almonds

128
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647

Nico

131
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
I need a particular case the interface is not Beach

132
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
Between man and machine is

133
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
Between man and woman

134
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Alright so it's

135
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
Contraption that looks

136
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
Looks like a chest

137
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
Sticky belt

138
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
That

139
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
It's for men but also for menopausal women

140
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
At

141
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
It said it really gives you the

142
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,151
The feeling of menstruation it has electrodes

143
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,759
The stimulate your lower abdomen and they give you cramps and then it has a Reservoir in the back your

144
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,063
Supposed to draw your blood put it in there

145
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
And then you have your blood drip

146
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
Exactly where it should so

147
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
The whole shabang

148
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
And to me

149
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,511
It's the ultimate gesture of understand

150
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
And

151
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,839
That's what I really love

152
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
That is

153
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
Two-faced not

154
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143

We're all trying to make technology visit

158
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
That's the truth

159
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
Just like we go through

160
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,967
The toll booths in freeways using easy

He passed and we still have that box

162
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Don't think about it

163
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
That's how

164
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,903
Life should be so that we can focus on real human habit

165
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
