Destiny

36
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:49,056
As a fashion object and symbol the high heel is weighted with meaning

37
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
It is also weighted

38
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,896
With the where's entire body weight

39
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
The high-heeled shoe

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,992
Might be one of the only designs

41
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,040
That is physically painful

42
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
And yet somehow purses

43
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,440
Avery truffelman doesn't tend to wear heels I really like the way he look

44
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
And I've tried wearing them

45
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
But I just

46
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
Cannot do it

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
So I talked to someone who actually wears them

48
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
Every

49
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,144
Day and I have a standing desk

50
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
So I'm even a bigger dumb

51
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,960
Wright Lake

52
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
I am in these heels all day and standing when all these other job you can't even tell she's doing it in

53
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
This is all things

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
From NPR

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,552
Believe it or not we radio folk actually bothered to get dressed

56
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
Trolley corners

57
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
Like a lot of professionals

58
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,536
High heels are strictly for the office commuting to work it's flat

59
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
After work

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,424
Back and forth because it is impossible I feel like to find a shoe that is

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
High heel.

62
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
Really gorgeous

63
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
And fundamentally comfortable

64
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:58,176
She's tried high heels that claim to use Comfort technology and it's like a three and a half inch for inch pump like

65
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:04,576
It's only going to be so comfortable there shoes that are wearable I can wear them front doors

66
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,976
Comfortable as possible and she does not like to complain you do

67
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,280
Yourself right so it's

68
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,888
Dumb to walk around heels hurt

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
I failed

70
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
At this look

71
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,592
But people have been failing at this look for a very long time

72
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
I can't

73
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Couch

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,456
When the heel was actually invent

75
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,784
I think that history is long buried

76
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
And

77
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,136
Dates back centuries and centuries and centuries in the near East

78
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
Elizabeth semmelhack

79
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,000
Sure it's a very specialized Museum in Toronto

80
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,584
I'm Elizabeth semmelhack and I'm the senior curator at the battle sheet music

81
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
I've got to ask

82
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,216
Why isn't it the shoezeum

83
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,568
I don't know you are the first to ask me that question

84
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,640
The collection of the baddest shoe Museum or shoezeum

85
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
Includes a lot of different kinds of Footwear

86
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,016
But high heels of the focus of Elizabeth

87
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
And the subject of her book

88
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
Heights of fashion

89
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
The history of the elevated shoe

90
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
And that his

91
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
As it turns out

92
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Started

93
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
With men

94
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,071
Many horseback riding cultures wore heels

95
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,631
On their boots and on their shoes for riding

96
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
He'll help you stay in the stirrups

97
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
What does my cowboy boots have heels

98
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
As early as the 10th century

99
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
The Persian Cavalry was wearing inch high heel

100
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
In Bruges I had a really big

101
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,687
Really talented mounted military

102
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
So the spread the

103
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
Continental European men

104
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
Field added to the riding boots

105
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
It's associated with

106
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,391
Upper class practice cuz having horses

107
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
Keeping horses yunnan

108
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
Lycoming sports car

109
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
And so it seems that from their men word first and within short order upper-class women

110
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Added heels to their own outfits

111
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
And then

112
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,703
Heels become

113
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,775
A form of Upper and middle-class stressed out the 70

114
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,359
But it really wasn't yet a strong signifier of gender

115
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,943
In all those paintings of Louis XIV little kitten heels

116
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
He's dressing like

117
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,551
A pillar of normative aristocratic masculinity years

118
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
Nothing effeminate about him

119
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
Bath time

120
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,439
But then he'll started to get gendered in their designs

121
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,303
Men's Health Group Broad and sturdy and women's became tapered and decorative

122
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:28,703
Finally mending them impractical agent Century the high heel strictly a lady shoe

123
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
And something really interesting happens at the end of the

124
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
18th century which is the French

125
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
I'm in the French Revolution happens

126
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
High heels

127
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:43,551
Although they were very much associated with femininity they were also very much associated with aristocratic femininity

128
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,415
Post French Revolution aristocracy and frivolity or out of the

129
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,463
And then he'll stay out of

130
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,511
Style for a really really long time

131
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Until

132
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,071
And this is Salma Hayek

133
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Siri

134
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,631
The invention of the camera

135
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
Because

136
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
With photography

137
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
Came pornography

138
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
And with the rise of pornography

139
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
Came the rise

140
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Of the Hill

141
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,687
Pornography embraced - Hills before Vashon dead

142
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,271
Because he owes work great when you don't have to move and you're just

143
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
Posing for a few minutes

144
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
It's around this time when heels be

145
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
Come sex

146
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:24,255
The pin-ups that are in the barracks during World War II

147
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
Almost always have high heels on

148
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,887
When the war is over in the Men return home

149
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,959
That is when the Stiletto was invented

150
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,263
Cuz the Stiletto brings fashion

151
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
Into a lineman

152
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
With meserole

153
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,151
As heels made their way out of photography

154
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
And onto the street

155
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
Into the office

156
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,759
There arose the engineering challenge

157
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
I'm trying to make

158
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,343
It's fundamentally uncomfortable thing

159
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,439
Comfortable putting the physics of putting the weight of a woman's body base

160
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
Stickley on the balls of her feet

161
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Is

162
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,095
You know that's a lot of pressure to try to Medicaid

163
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,423
So people try to find ways around the design

164
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,263
There are foldable flat shoes that you can take with you and you just can't take

165
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
The pain of a high heel anymore

166
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,847
But if you want to go to Whole Nine Yards

167
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
Or nine hours in pumps

168
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
YouTube is full of hat

169
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
Tips and tricks

170
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
Flopping off

171
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,695
MacGyver type sixes for the shoe

172
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:32,351
Scissors

173
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Do not burn yourself

174
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,775
MacGyver type fixes for the foot

175
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,103
Skip work classes and tutorials for learning how to walk in heels

176
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
Practice practice practice

177
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:50,527
And I don't want you girls to be afraid about going up and down the stairs in heels it's actually fairly easy

178
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:56,159
In the most extreme cases people have gotten surgeries to shorten their pinky toes dead and their nerves

179
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
Botox into their feet

180
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231
All to circumvent

181
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
The pain of a high heel

182
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,351
Start to feel at the very bottom of your

183
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
Your foot the ball your foot

184
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,263
And then I'll start to rub on your heels and rub on the sides

185
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,359
And then suddenly stepped down and it's going to be a shooting

186
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
Stabbing pain

187
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
And after that pain you go numb

188
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
Meet the twins

189
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
Animal alien

190
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
I'm three minutes older I'm Jessica

191
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,647
We have a vintage inspired modern Comfort wedding shoe line

192
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,999
So that people who are getting married don't have numb feet or aching legs

193
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
Crooked posture

194
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
Or nerve damage

195
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
Because it's not just your foot pain

196
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
It's your

197
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,935
Ankle pain is it shortens your calves

198
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:45,567
It ruins your posture not to mention bunions and hammertoe and haglund's deformity

199
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,895
Google these if you want to but do not click image search

200
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:54,015
Some things you just can't unsee young twins designed hack into the shoe

201
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,575
And borrowed elements from other kinds of Footwear

202
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
When we actually first started we

203
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
Frankenstein the most comfortable athletic

204
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
Of different shoes they started with the toe box

205
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,047
Which is basically the very front of the shoe

206
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
Where the toes are

207
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,423
The triple toe box from a salsa dancers high heel which tends to be roomier

208
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,727
Just to give you a foot enough room

209
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
To be able to

210
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:20,127
Well as you're standing every foot will swell throughout the day the whole shoes really padded and cushion

211
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
And like running shoe

212
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
They have Arts

213
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
Don't write in

214
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
They're not stilettos

215
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,855
For balance purposes the Leon's made that you'll stick where it meets the foot

216
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
But for aesthetic

217
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
The sturdy healed tapers

218
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
To a finer point

219
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
Where it meets the floor

220
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,327
You don't want to look at this shoe and think it's a cup

221
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,655
Although Comfort shoe is relative

222
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,727
We guarantee our shoes are going to be at least an hour more

223
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,543
Comfortable than all your other shoe

224
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,151
For the Leung twins even the most comfortable high heels still have a time limit

225
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,687
But Martha Davis

226
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
This begs to differ

227
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
So I wear these shoes

228
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,367
12 hours a day everyday and I know

229
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
Quite a few women who do the same and I

230
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
I've never had any problems

231
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
About Martha Davis is talking about shoes that she made

232
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
My name is Mark

233
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Davis

234
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
And I'm an industrial designer

235
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,191
And I've been working in the Footwear industry for the last eight

236
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,263
You may be familiar with her industrial design work

237
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,359
Martha Davis design the compact case for the pill

238
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
Like aliens win

239
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,479
Davis was wearing high heels before she started designing them

240
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,551
And she couldn't find a high-heeled shoe that look good

241
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
And didn't cause pain

242
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:37,695
Davis went to Milan to study a process of shoemaking called balloon

243
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,511
Which emphasizes measurement and proportionality

244
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
And her takeaway

245
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
Is this

246
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
Successful as long as

247
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
It's not a question of the

248
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
And there's one critical point

249
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
Weather fit

250
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
Really matter

251
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
And it's called the calzada

252
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
How's that

253
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
I called the fitting point

254
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
That's the number one critical

255
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,855
If you look down at your feet it's kind of right before your foot becomes your toes

256
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,927
Some terms of girth it's the widest part of your

257
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
But you have to secure that

258
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
Spot and make sure it's not too loose

259
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,863
Talk to tight though calzada is not the only significant spot

260
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,471
The toolbox could be too shallow and the pitch of the heel to be too steep or not sleep enough

261
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
There are number of factors

262
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:29,407
But it's most important to keep the calzada in proportion to the other numbers for comfort and security

263
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,503
Method allows Martha to play around with sculptural forms and hard materials

264
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
Steal a gnarled wood

265
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
With hardly

266
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Annie Potts

267
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
No she keeps her shoes relatively low

268
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
Put a quote on quote

269
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
Low heel is nothing to scoff at

270
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
I wore round 3 inch heels

271
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
This week just to

272
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
To try it and my feet are killing me

273
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
Why bother

274
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Mosto

275
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
I asked Audie Cornish.

276
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Into

277
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,871
Same twins that makes me feel awkward about discussing high heels

278
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
What is the same thing that makes me think like

279
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,015
Why do I shave my legs

280
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
Feminism

281
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,087
101

282
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Collegiate self

283
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,439
Deck railing at me from

284
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,279
Being like you sold out it every way possible.

285
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
There is something to be

286
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Sad for

287
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
A well-made

288
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
That

289
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Kind of

290
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,615
Makes your calves look amazing and puts that like

291
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,943
Inappropriate probably sexy arch in your back

292
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
I like that feeling

293
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,807
The heel is so tied up in web

294
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Gender

295
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Sex and

296
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
Power

297
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Look

298
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
I can't speak for everyone

299
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
But when it comes to the appeal of the heel

300
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
It's actually not very complex

301
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Psychology

302
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
Kiehl's

303
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
Affect the way you move through the world

304
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
They change your walk

305
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
They make you

306
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Push your shoulders back

307
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Hold your head up

308
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
Swing your hips

309
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
They make you taller

310
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
But it's not really about that

311
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
I mean I'm already pretty

312
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,551
Actually in general height is not as big a factor as you would say

313
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,391
People will often say to me while women wear high heels today

314
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:21,791
He doesn't want to be as tall as men understand

315
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
That reasoning but

316
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
There are many many many men

317
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Who would

318
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
Equally benefit

319
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
Increase height

320
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
Until why are they ignoring

321
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
The potential power of the high heel

322
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,455
But it wasn't too long ago when heels for guys were kind of cool

323
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,271
Think of the opening scene in Saturday Night Fever

324
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,343
John Travolta is walking through the streets of New York

325
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,159
Annie's strutting around in high heel boots

326
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,951
The camera is focused

327
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,535
It puts an undeniable Swagger

328
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
In his steps

329
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,143
Men try high heels in the seventies and why didn't it stick

330
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,447
The Condemned Elizabeth similax research

331
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,007
Men's heels in the 70s were too tied up in subbed

332
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
The exoticizing elements

333
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
Captain

334
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
On The Fringe

335
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:13,759
Until the men's chunky platform went out of style when power dressing of the 1980s came along

336
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
Men wearing suits and ties

337
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
Women wearing suits and heels

338
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
And they still are

339
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
But high heel could come

340
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
Timmy mean

341
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
Simply professional power

342
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
Or it could come to be that

343
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
Female professionals are the new

344
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Power Brokers

345
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:34,751
But then I would not be surprised if that happens that men will be as eager to wear high heels as when

346
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Okay

347
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,591
But only if they can design comfortable

Turn the living room lights on
