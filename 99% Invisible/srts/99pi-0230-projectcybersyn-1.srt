This is 99% invisible

I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:16,032
The date September 11th is of course very significant for people in the US

25
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,128
The country of Chile also has an important September 11

26
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
And their history

27
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:25,248
On 9/11 1973 using both airstrikes

28
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,648
I'm grounded a military Junta violently took control of Chile

29
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,488
At the time I president Salvador Allende

30
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
Producer Katie Mingle

31
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:42,144
Zendaya become president of Chile in a free and democratic election

32
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,192
After the military coup

33
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,984
General Augusto Pinochet

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,544
Took power brutally as a dictator

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Until 1990

36
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
After taking over the country

37
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
The military dissolve Congress

38
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Took control of the media

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,112
And what about dismantling all of the Socialist and Democratic institutions that I India's government had built

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,416
And somewhere in the midst of all of this

41
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:10,816
The new military regime discovered something in a nondescript office building in Downtown Santiago

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
It was a room

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
A very strange room

44
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,240
I've heard people compare it to something out of

45
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
Kubrick film

46
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
Star Trek

47
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,456
That's eating Medina professor of informatics and Computing at Indiana University in Bloomington does

48
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
Driving the strange

49
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,808
Place it's quite striking in this bright

50
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,832
Technicolor

51
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,368
Oranges

52
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
Wood paneling

53
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,488
Picture of the deck of the Starship Enterprise and you're not that far off

54
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,888
The room was hexagonal in shape with 7 white fiberglass chairs arranged in an inward facing Circle

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,984
There were colorful space AG screens is playing chart

56
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
Fangraphs

57
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
Town hall 6 walls

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
When Pinochet is men found this room they didn't

59
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
Quite know what to make of it

60
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:02,016
It said that one of them began stabbing its colorful display screens with a knife

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
And it's no wonder they didn't understand this

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,648
There's never been anything quite like it

63
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
This operations room

64
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
Was the physical interface

65
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
Extra complicated system called

66
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
Project

67
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Cybersaint

68
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,912
Project cybersyn have been designed helped you a socialist

69
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
Experiment work better

70
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
It was just one of the ways that former president in they have been trying to do socialism differently than it is

71
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
Never been done before

72
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,856
So let's back up before the coup

73
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,416
For the Sci-Fi operations room was built

74
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,256
Salvador Allende have been elected in 1970

75
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,864
He was the first Marxist president ever elected democratically in any country

76
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,728
That's his campaign song you're hearing right now it's called vinceremos

77
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
Or We Shall Overcome

78
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,920
Finn by the band she left it was one of many protest songs and chants to come out of in days campaign

79
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,696
Poor and working-class people sang Enchanted and finally voted in day into office

80
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
They loved

81
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:24,191
And I and I hoped he could show the world that she lay was going to be different than the communist and socialist experiments

82
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
In other countries

83
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:30,335
Is Government after all have been elected democratically and it was deeply committed to

84
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
Protecting civil liberties

85
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,431
So it did not want to get rid of it

86
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
Constitution it did not want to

87
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
Censor the Press

88
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,807
It wanted to preserve freedom of speech

89
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,927
And right away the government raises employment and wages for people across Chile

90
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,047
And they start a program of agrarian reform to redistribute the ownership of land

91
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
And they also begin a program to make consumer goods that previously had been reserved for the elite

92
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,799
To try to make them more broadly accessible to the Chilean people

93
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,895
Toward this end I end a formed in industrial Design Group in his government

94
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
He believed design was political

95
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,831
We where's thinking that we we're doing something great for short people than good

96
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
That's Fernando Flores

97
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,463
He began working in the IND Government after the election

98
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,559
And he says to say it was an exciting time is an understatement

99
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
It wasn't just excitement

100
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
Was like being in love

101
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,751
Why would someone do I sink in the 24 hours a day

102
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
We will

103
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Working

104
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,871
United Country

105
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
What's an adventure for

106
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,967
For those people that believe

107
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Pool country

108
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,063
What's an adventure for those that believe tonight end

109
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
An adventure

110
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
But also

111
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
Ton of work

112
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183
So the central problem

113
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,535
Is a central problem in socialist Revolution

114
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:58,655
Which is the government must go about turning all the private businesses into public businesses

115
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,007
You just think about the challenge of bringing the most important industries

116
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,311
In your country under State Control

117
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
And not having the experience

118
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
To do so

119
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,199
The government eventually took control of 150 Enterprises

120
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,247
Including several of the largest companies

121
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
In Chile

122
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
And this is the not-so-fun part

123
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
Us socialist Revolution

124
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
Management

125
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,207
Only people that don't care about money

126
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Did Ikea

127
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,535
Fernando Flores cared about manager

128
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,375
Any other idea for how to manage chillies complicated

129
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Economy

130
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
He wanted use a relatively new site

131
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
Called cybernetic

132
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,919
Cybernetics is a science that became popular around World War II

133
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:48,319
As humans develop new kinds of machines we became interested in developing systems for controlling those machines

134
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,927
Cybernetics looks at how to design intelligent self-correcting system

135
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,255
Cybernetics is based on the word kubernetes

136
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
Which is Greek

137
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:03,935
For steersman the goal of a steersman is to get the ship to the destination taking into account all

138
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,775
All kinds of feedback from the environment like wind currents

139
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,591
All cybernetic systems have goals

140
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:15,199
So you can think about the heating and cooling system in your home as a cybernetic system

141
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,527
The goal is to keep your house at a desired temperature

142
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,111
The thermostat does this by telling the heater or the air conditioner

143
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
When to turn on and off

144
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,719
Depending on feedback it's receiving from the environment

145
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
It's an intelligent

146
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
Self regulating system with a goal

147
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
In England in the

148
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,727
A consultant named Stafford beer was applying concepts of cybernetics

149
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
In business management

150
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,591
He believed a business could be thought of as an intelligence

151
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
System

152
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,943
If the goal was to sell more product or work more efficiently

153
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,319
You could using the principles of cybernetics design the system to work toward those goals

154
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:59,487
But Stafford beer had never imagined he get to apply his ideas to helping a whole government 6/8

155
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,815
And then I said which way must change my life

156
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,375
It was from the technical general manager

157
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
Estate planning board of Chile

158
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,543
That Stafford beer in archival tape from 1974

159
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,359
The letter he got was from Fernando Flores

160
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
Tok in this letter

161
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
Oh that he had City termite works

162
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
It's late

163
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Together

164
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
And what are things coming to take it over

165
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,671
The distance to stop me on a on a journey which

166
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,487
Make me travel 8000 Miles

167
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Over and over and over again

168
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Meeting

169
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
Between London and Santiago for 2 years

170
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,799
Stafford beers first trip to Santiago was in 1971 when he arrived he and Fernando Flores and the

171
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
The team that assembled in Chile

172
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
When about designing

173
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
Cybernetic system

174
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,503
I can help them manage the bureaucracy of the new Chilean economy

175
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
They would call this project

176
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
Cybersn

177
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,183
Stafford beer had long stringy hair in a long beard

178
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,743
He look like he should be leading yoga retreats not

179
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,047
Teaching major corporations About Management

180
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,447
Beer was particularly interested in using cybernetics to help companies redistribute power within the system

181
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
And chili

182
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Was interested in this to

183
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
How do we make

184
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
Institutions

185
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,895
I'm non-hierarchical how do we distribute decision

186
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,783
The first thing bearded was map and model chilles entire economy

187
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
This was a really complex process

188
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,999
Uninvolved understanding how each part of the economy was affected by other parts and by outside feedback

189
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
On paper it looks

190
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,143
Like a big block diagram connected with lines and arrows

191
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Now we have the economy

192
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
These are

193
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
Big major branches of India

194
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Evian

195
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Niacin

196
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
Materials industry

197
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
It wasn't enough however

198
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Berta just

199
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,527
Understand how all the parts are two ways economy connected

200
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,367
It was also crucial that the different parts be able to communicate with each other

201
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,719
Beer wanted factories to be able to send and receive information

202
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:13,375
He wanted to create a vast computer network that connected all the factories in Chile

203
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
Idea

204
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
This was pre-internet

205
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,495
Computer networks weren't really a thing yet

206
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
But there was a problem with

207
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
This idea

208
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,639
There are only a handful of computers in all of Chile

209
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
And beer

210
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
He only had access to one

211
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,343
These guys they had to create a computer network using one computer

212
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,647
Which is pretty amazing

213
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
So they improvised

214
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,023
They realized okay we can't put computers throughout the

215
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,095
But we can do is we have these Telex machine

216
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,935
Telex machine looks like a typewriter but it's hooked up to a telephone line

217
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,007
So imagine you and your friend you both have Telex machine

218
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
You can type a message on the keyboard hit send

219
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
And your friends talks will receive it

220
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,175
And literally type it out to a piece of paper

221
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,991
It's like super steam punk Gchat

222
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,063
I think Gchat is a great way to think about it

223
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
Everyday someone for a fact

224
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
Would send data via Telex

225
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
To another tablet

226
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
Where it would be received by an operator

227
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
And then entered into the Central Computer

228
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,095
The kinds of data that people

229
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
Might send

230
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
Could include raw material

231
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
Right how much cotton

232
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
You have how much

233
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
Cold you

234
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
The central computer software program

235
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
Cyber strike

236
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
Was able to analyze the data

237
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
Warn about potential problem

238
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
This is

239
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,319
What your worker absentee level was today this is what it was the day before

240
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,903
This is what it was the day before that what is it going to be tomorrow

241
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
Are you going to have a problem

242
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,255
Decisions could then be made about what to do

243
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,095
And this brings us back to that bizarre hexagonal room

244
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,143
The one that look like something out of a Kubrick

245
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Or Star Trek

246
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,519
The operations room

247
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
It is a

248
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,615
Futuristic decision-making space

249
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
Deptford beer wanted to build a

250
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
Physical space for project

251
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Cybersn

252
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,271
Actually he wanted to build several of them

253
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,599
Oliver chili but only one was ever finished

254
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,207
The room was inspired in part by Winston Churchill's war room

255
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,535
So you can imagine the general sitting around smoking their cigars

256
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
In this case

257
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,375
Petroleum sitting around smoking cigarettes and perhaps

258
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Drinking pee

259
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,263
But unlike Churchill's war room and this is a key difference

260
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
This was a room for non hierarchy

261
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Decision making

262
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,431
Stafford beer imagine Factory workers and higher level bureaucrat

263
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
That's a like

264
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
Making decisions together

265
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,159
The projector is there so what

266
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
That's guidon CFA

267
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
Originally from Germany

268
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,911
I have been working in Chili's industrial Design Group and was busy designing cool products for the masses

269
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,519
When he was taught to help design the operations room for project cybersyn

270
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:05,919
Eventually he realized Stafford beer wanted the room to be so much more than a standard meeting room

271
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,015
During the project I became more and more aware of the

272
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Complexity

273
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
Bentley admission office

274
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,879
Face

275
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,439
Which made it possible for the users

276
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
Use the system

277
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,839
The room needed to be Democratic and state-of-the-art

278
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
Please

279
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
No tables

280
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
Stuff for PSN look

281
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
This is room

282
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
For making decisions

283
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
Music for reading

284
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,663
Meatballs in talking about

285
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Add notes

286
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
He was very categorically

287
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,343
The room was designed to quickly convey information about factories

288
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
All over 2A

289
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:51,487
You have charts and graphs of factory production on the walls

290
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,327
You have a photograph of the factory that is discussed

291
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,423
You have flashing lights that show whether there are emergencies

292
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:05,311
7 people would sit in a circle discussing and deciding how to proceed with various

293
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
Problems

294
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,663
7 because it's an odd number to facilitate voting

295
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:16,319
A in a circle so that no one would be prioritised over anyone else so it's not a rectangular table with

296
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Ahead

297
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,927
Each chair the operations room had a place to set your whiskey

298
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,207
An ashtray

299
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,559
And a set of buttons one could use to control the display screens on each wall

300
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
It's Mad Men

301
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Meats start

302
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,215
Dobhan champagne since they weren't consciously trying to make it look

303
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Futuristic

304
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,079
Certainly was not our idea.

305
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
Science fiction

306
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
Inmate

307
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,431
Science reality what you said

308
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
What's something different

309
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,319
But to me there is a bit of fiction in all of it

310
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,415
It's an Immaculate piece of design but it conceals

311
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
Monkey technology

312
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,047
The buttons on the chairs for instance were connected to some wires

313
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,167
That ran under the floor and behind the wall and eventually connected to 3 slide

314
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,031
And depending on the combination of buttons that you pushed

315
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,079
It would advance

316
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,175
Once I Carousel or another or tell the slide Carousel to move backwards

317
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
I'm as a way to

318
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
Pull up the desire

319
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
These screens couldn't display information in real time you can only display and discuss slides that have been pre-made

320
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:29,023
So it says image of modernity but behind it there's just a lot

321
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
Human labor

322
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,119
Going into to making this illusion possible

323
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,519
Well project cybersyn was coming together and the futuristic operations room was being designed and built

324
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,359
Things are not going so well for the agenda government

325
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,943
So all of this is taking place during the

326
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
The heart

327
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
The Cold War

328
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,319
And Latin America has emerged as

329
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
A Battlefield

330
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,719
The u.s. have been actively working with people with in Chile who were unhappy with the government

331
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,791
So the US was intervening in Chile

332
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,095
In many many many different ways

333
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
That the IND

334
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
They had been

335
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,007
Involved in denying Chile

336
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Farm Credit

337
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:16,383
It became increasingly difficult for Chileans to get ahold of

338
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Us

339
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,527
Machinery if you don't have the parts you can't keep the machines running

340
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,575
The economy was collapsing

341
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,879
Inflation had started

342
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
Skyrocket

343
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
So people are having trouble getting

344
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
Basic

345
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Items

346
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
And then just

347
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,607
3 years after Allende was elected

348
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
And She lays September 11th

349
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
September 11

350
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Insensitive

351
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
Weather

352
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,799
I don't want to talk about that

353
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
EBay memories

354
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
That's Fernando Flores again

355
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,783
I wasn't in the palace with depression and some other people

356
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,855
Who has landed well pumps.

357
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Claims

358
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,207
While the presidential Palace was bombed

359
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,279
By a military Junta supported by the United States

360
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,607
Allende gave his final radio address to the country

361
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,359
Long Live to a long live the people long live the workers

362
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
Pisang

363
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:26,271
These have been my last words and I'm certain that My Sacrifice will not be in vain

364
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:32,159
I'm certain that at the very least it will be a lesson that will punish felons cowardice and season

365
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,239
Those explosions were recorded in the actual radio broadcast

366
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,871
Salvador Allende took his own life that same day shortly after giving that address

367
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:58,015
It's estimated that during pinochet's rule about 38000 people wear in prison

368
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
And most of those prisoners were tortured

369
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,623
Close to three thousand people were executed

370
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
Another 1200 people went missing

371
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,487
I'm two hundred thousand people were exiled

372
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
The other countries

373
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
In fact

374
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,375
Chilipitin the band that wrote in days campaign song was exiled

375
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
France where they wrote a new song

376
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,103
The people United will never be to

377
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
If you did

378
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
The song became the anthem of resistance

379
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
10 seconds Pinochet

380
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,551
And the chorus is continued to be a chant at leftist protest

381
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
Across the world

382
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,423
Project cybersyn never got fully up and running

383
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,215
The Telex network was set up

384
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,495
System restarting

385
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Receive data from back

386
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
They were slow to come in

387
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
And the operations room

388
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Was finished

389
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,175
And it hadn't really been put to use

390
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:03,295
Grievance eBay managed to escape chili with the one color photograph

391
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,599
Ever taken of the operations room

392
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,183
And various other documents related to cybersyn

393
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
It was for me

394
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,767
The meeting at the intersection

395
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
Scientific Technology

396
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Politics

397
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
Ant Design

398
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,935
This does not happen very of my WhatsApp

399
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,263
Cybersyn was maybe just a bit ahead of its

400
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,127
Time and network piece together with Telex machines and one computer

401
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:32,223
Just a couple decades before the internet made this kind of thing commonplace

402
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:37,599
An operations room designed to convey information as quickly as possible

403
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,695
Only you had to crawl behind a wall and put a new slide in the carousel

404
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,999
When you wanted to show something to the group

405
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,095
Severson's technology was probably never up to the task at hand

406
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:54,751
But then again it was a technology designed to help socialism succeed while the United States did everything in its power

407
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
Where to make it fail

408
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,591
Maybe no technology was up to that time

409
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Heaven's Sake

410
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
At that time

411
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
We were so inspired

412
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
Bicep possibility

413
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,039
It is possible to change

414
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Society

415
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:12,159
When you look at the operations room I mean how can you not look at it

416
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,207
And see that this is someone's dream

417
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,535
Right that this is someone's utopian vision

418
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
There is

419
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,607
There's a kind of hope

420
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
About it

421
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,471
When Pinochet took over Chile

422
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,799
He destroyed the strange futuristic space

423
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,871
Been embodied the utopian dreams of the eye in the government

424
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
Piano used

455
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,168
Makes for a much more natural experience

456
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216

Five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

481
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,936
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

482
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,472
That whines through a

Might cost you your life

486
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:19,712
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

487
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:24,064
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

488
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,416
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

489
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:35,072
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff actually if I'm being honest

490
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing

491
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,800
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

492
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,128
Was found dead in my private gym

493
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:51,456
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

494
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,808
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

495
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
Now

496
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,136
I need to clear my name

497
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:04,512
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

498
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
