I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,240
In the beginning was the word

24
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,288
And the word was

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,640
Well actually there was just one word long endless

26
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
Just years

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
Text

28
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,480
In Europe

29
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,040
Add no spaces between words

30
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,112
There was nothing at all to guide the reader

31
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
That's Keith Houston

32
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:37,792
He's returning 99ci Gaston author of the book Shady characters

33
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,424
Have to find the boundaries between words would have to work out where

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,496
Sentences and clauses began

35
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
Intended on the road

36
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
Sometimes it's never-ending string of letters would execute what was called an ox turn if the first one to text read from

37
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,320
Not to write the line below it would read from right to left with the characters themselves drawn backwards

38
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,880
The point is reading was hard

39
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
So

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,440
There was a librarian

41
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,816
Alexandria the third Century BC called Aristophanes suggested that

42
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,424
Readers might want to use the adults but you're very easy to insert between letters

43
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,216
In order to help them

44
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
Remember where the pauses where

45
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,824
The system didn't follow strict rules of grammar

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,128
It wasn't about demarcating sentences

47
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
What about rhythm

48
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,480
It was initially a kind of stage Direction it was

49
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,296
All about the performance of the text

50
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
So

51
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,624
Point halfway up the line was it a short pause

52
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,440
I'm going to the bottom of the line is a longer pause

53
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,488
The point to the top of the line was longer

54
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
Kind of like a.

55
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:48,448
Aristophanes little dots form the system from which almost all Western punctuation stems

56
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
A partial thought

57
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:55,616
Followed by the shortest a, a fuller thought was calling a colon in a complete thought

58
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
Appirio toes

00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664

00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,799
Comedian copy with somebody you're never going to say! You say bang

190
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,615
But when she came up with the idea and you talked about it

191
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
How serious fuzzy

192
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
Oh he was very serious

193
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
And you really thought that

194
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,087
People in advertising would hook onto it

195
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
So what happened to spectres in bed

196
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
It really is in the dictionary

197
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
Waiting to be used

198
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
Why haven't we seen more interrobang

199
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
It's not easy to Advanced

200
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Punctuation

201
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
That actually sticks

202
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
That's cute Houston

203
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
Clear Keith loves me

204
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
The painting to say this

205
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:54,015
It turns out in inventing the successful Market punctuation particularly in Denmark

206
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Is really hard

207
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
History is filled with far more attempts

208
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Creating a

209
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
Pretty much all of which I failed

210
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
Anne Arundel by the

211
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
16th century

212
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,327
The perfect station mark this rhetorical?

213
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
Last about 50 years before

214
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
It disappeared

215
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:17,567
There's any Mark invented by a kind of renaissance man called John Wilkins who proposed on invert

216
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
!

217
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,527
Which seemingly from the day it was born based a string of bad luck

218
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
For example

219
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:32,159
Article praising interrobang appeared in the New York Herald Tribune in 1962

220
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,231
The writer read Martin's original piece in hypetalk

221
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Tribune article

222
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
The writer called the interrobang

223
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Scrooge

224
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,911
But unfortunately his article was published on the 1st of April

225
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,239
And took it as an April Fool's joke

226
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,127
Still our baby punctuation mark persevere

227
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,783
In 1966 a company called the American type founders of legendary design firm that created some of the most why

228
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
Widely used typefaces between century

229
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,415
Unveiled a new typeface called Americana

230
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
That included an interrobang

231
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
And then the company

232
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
Americana was the last phone thing actually caught

233
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,655
And so they did not cuss anymore

234
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
Interrobang

235
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
All was not lost

236
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:24,127
Near 1968-d iconic typewriter company Remington announced that their latest model typewriter

237
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
Heatran optional interrobang

238
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,735
But I wonder if perhaps

239
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
The fact that you had

240
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,855
To pay some extra money to get an interrobang key might have turned people off

241
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
Today interrobang is just

242
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
Barely hanging in

243
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
Is recognized by Webster

244
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
Medina creative

245
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
Rising number of computer

246
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
Even has its own character in unicode

247
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
Common directory of symbols

248
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
All computer fonts

249
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
But keep points out that it still hasn't cleared

250
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Biggest type of graph

251
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
I think that's

252
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
To consider to be a real Market punctuation

253
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
Keep left the use of that thinking about

254
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,879
In other words a truly remarkable Mark of punctuation must be

255
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
Unremarkable

256
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
It must be by now

257
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,511
Banality is not one of the interrobang

258
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,583
Remington's brief attempt to get the key

259
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,887
It never made it onto any standard keyboard

260
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
And now

261
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
Is included in a file

262
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,287
Accessible only with a nested series of menus in selection

263
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
So when people do use it

264
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
They're deliberately going out of their way to

265
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
You so

266
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
Using it because it's fun

267
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:38,879
Keith is going on the document ever more outlandish examples of the interrobang which have perversely

268
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,463
Only made it stand out more further undermining its legitimacy

269
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:48,351
Quick Facebook search yields at least two bands named interrobang one Punk one brass

270
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,191
In 2014 in Australian cartographer in the state of Victoria

271
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,007
Painted an interrobang on the roof of his house

272
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,055
It's not visible on Google Maps

273
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
In 2017

274
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,687
The Minneapolis Star Tribune obituary for the poet J Otis Powell

275
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,759
Could always ended his name with an exclamation point

276
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
But changed it to an interrobang

277
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Before his death

278
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,927
None of these examples are in the service of an explanatory question

279
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
They're there to be noticed

280
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
You sometimes see it on

281
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Twitter

282
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Someone will ask a question

283
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
Taiwanese with an interrobang

284
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
But then they'll stick in

285
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,543
Interrobang just make sure that you absolutely got the Joker that you actually

286
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
Salt River Tubing

287
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
So the banality

288
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,175
Isn't there yet still stands out

289
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Emperor Keith

290
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
This is the Brass Ring app

291
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
Ordinary People

292
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Employee interrobang

293
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
For no other reason

294
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Beyond the fact

295
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Descendants of ham

296
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Hospital to use

297
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,047
Maybe then we can say that is made it maybe then we can say that it sucked

298
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
It's a real

299
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,351
Market punctuation

300
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
Just watch me

301
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
We'd only find a question

302
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,287
Have you ever seen any new truly honest

303
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
Your truly

304
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
Interrobang

305
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
So to speak

306
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
In an unselfconscious way

307
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
In

308
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
Hooks

309
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
In newspapers

310
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
I just don't know about

311
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,951
Perhaps it's a flying under the radar

312
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
However

313
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Takis

314
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
I might know

315
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
1

316
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
Genuinely banal interrobang

317
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
Cuz it turns out

318
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
There's this guy

319
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
Frank Easterbrook

320
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
Cleavage

321
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,335
Chief judge of the United States court of appeals for the seventh circuit

322
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
We totally sounds like a judge

323
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
Annie's kind of a big deal

324
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,223
The court of appeals is the second highest court

325
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,063
Before that I was Deputy solicitor general of the United States

326
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:50,975
The solicitor General's office is the office that argues the interest of the United States in the Supreme Court

327
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
Just like Martin

328
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,607
The chief judge for the United States court of appeals for the seventh circuit

329
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
Is a type of file

330
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:02,751
Because when I started reading I noticed that some things were easier to read than others

331
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,567
I started looking in the back of the books

332
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Because

333
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
That would be a line on my last

334
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Paige saying

335
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
This book is set in

336
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
With that name that I face

337
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
Who designed

338
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,087
And that's stuck with me ever since

339
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,695
And now God help the lawyer who submits a brief to Easter books Court

340
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
In Times New Roman

341
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,279
The default font of our times

342
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,631
Does not fly in the 7th circuit

343
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
Times New Roman

344
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
The reason why Times New Roman

345
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
It has been a plague

346
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,799
Is the punch newspaper typeface

347
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,103
We were lawyers to use walkie-talkie

348
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,431
National rule of Appellate Procedure

349
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
32

350
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
0

351
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
Easter bread

352
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Esoteric

353
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Just

354
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,207
This courtroom is a proper place and Hughes

355
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Everything

356
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,559
In May of 2011 Easterbrook was writing a ruling for a case

357
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
Case of Sears vs Crowley

358
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Realized

359
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
Secret himself

360
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,751
I reached a point where I had

361
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,871
Written a rhetorical question in the opinion where I was tempted to use in all

362
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
?!

363
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
?

364
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
!

365
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
Debridement

366
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
He can start changing

367
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
Just to avoid indignity of

368
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
Bring all those marks back to back

369
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
You know he knew it would make his argument

370
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,511
But then judge Frank Easterbrook remembered something

371
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,351
An obscure Mark of punctuation that would allow him to keep the sentence

372
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,399
In all its rhetorical Glory

373
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Just as it was

374
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
So

375
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
Out came the interrobang

376
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
What better place

377
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
I'm self-conscious interrobang to appear

378
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
The American legal

379
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,551
Appreciated at the time

380
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,855
MasterCard points and it was a printing error

381
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,951
And of course my clerks had this reaction when they saw they said

382
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,767
There must be some garbled hear what happened

383
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,631
And I told him know this is a real character it's called an interrobang

384
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,471
And they both immediately looked it up on Wikipedia where it

385
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,007
Has its own entry

386
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,359
Mr. Brooks latest interrobang into a dense paragraph of legally

387
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,431
Actually had to read the entire 8-page opinion

388
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
Make sure that he used it correctly

389
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
Sentence defy summary

390
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
But when I can tell you

391
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,879
Is that the Everlasting Joy of Keith Houston

392
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Appointment of the interrobang

393
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
Is extremely bad

394
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
Just so matter-of-fact it's just it's just in there

395
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,863
There are no Pages before it in Pages after it

396
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,679
There's nothing to say hey I just use an interrobang

397
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,751
Johnny gives easterbrook's interabang even more awesome

398
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
Biereley wasn't showing off

399
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,615
Normandy publicized it in anyways

400
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Still

401
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,455
How to administer one last

402
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
We kind of like

403
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,831
Chomping at the bit to use it where you like man I just can't wait for an opportunity

404
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,695
No I wasn't chomping at the bit to use

405
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
Where are you

406
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
Planning on using it again

407
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
If the occasion arises

408
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:16,287
Shortly after Easterbrook issued his opinion his quiet U7 secure form of punctuation with

409
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
Spotted by illegal blog

410
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,639
And added to the interabangs Wikipedia page

411
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
When we told Easterbrook this

412
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
He laughed

413
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,295
He said he never intended to draw attention to the interrobang

414
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
He just thought

415
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,367
The right Mark to use

416
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,263
From a typographic character you don't see all that much

417
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
The one that

418
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,591
And maybe see all too often

419
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
We revisit the story of the Octapharma

420
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
After this

421
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
Between the beats

422
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,695
Bongs and chatter of our devices

423
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,279
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

424
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
If

425
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,911
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

426
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:20,799
Talking to me and my wife is in another room and another hearing. Voice

427
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
Technology talk to us

428
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
It is a creation of Sonic trap

429
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,711
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

430
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,295
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

431
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
To make them more human

432
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,183
Turn the living room lights on

433
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Okay

434
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
Dim the living room lights to 50

435
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
2%

436
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Okay

437
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:49,983
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

438
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
Makes for a much more natural

439
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Experience

440
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,847
Turn the living room lights on

441
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
Dim the living room lights

442
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
50%

443
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:06,367
Representing two special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

444
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

445
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,743
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

446
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,863
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th right here on the 9th 9 p.m.

447
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
We need to talk about something

448
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,543
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

449
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,383
It's not that bad to take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine

450
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,431
Thinking about it all the time is frustrate

451
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:35,807
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

452
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:42,207
You don't know why and it may be time to seek help go to oh my God. Info / podcast

00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Oh my God

Flask podcast

456
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
Like the interrobang the octopus

457
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
Also known as

458
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
Poshmark or the pound sign

459
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:00,639
Is a special character that existed for a long time on the periphery of punctuation

460
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,711
But unlike interrobang the octothorpe

461
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,807
Took off and became something we use everyday thanks to new technology

462
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
Here's the story of the ox

463
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,927
It was originally released in December 2014

464
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,767
Every morning I wake up

465
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
Rollover

466
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
Pick up my phone

467
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
Intertwitter

468
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
Not proud of this

469
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
Just the way it is

470
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:29,311
Twitter always struck me as the social media platform that was the most like Broadcasting

471
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:34,687
It's an ongoing conversation

472
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
Angel bow

473
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,271
It's a lot like scanning to a radio dial

474
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,343
Which mainly comprised of the people they know

475
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
Telling you about their day

476
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,439
Reacting to shocking news making jokes

477
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,975
Sending around legs

478
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:54,143
I deleted Roman Mars by the way before and sometimes I tweet

479
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,191
Producers name is Avery droppleman

480
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,751
But if you want to find out about the show in general

481
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
Is a hashtag for it

482
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
It's

483
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:07,455
#990 eye of course is comprised of two vertical lines intersecting two

484
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,783
Two horizontal lines that looks like a Tic Tac Toe board

485
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,135
In the current Digital World the hashtag identifies movements events

486
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,696
Happenings Brands topics of all kinds

487
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,304
Hashtags help people gather that's incredible power to give to like individuals

488
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,608
As a character I mean awesome

489
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,424
It's got like this little typographic superhero story now

490
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,544
And this superhero story star is Chris Messina I'm Chris Messina the inventor of the hashtag

491
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
Designer

492
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
And translator

493
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Translator

494
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
Human culture

495
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,200
That's probably a little bit bloated

496
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
I don't know I don't know

497
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,040
Chris was the first one to use a hashtag on Twitter

498
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:49,440
Before it was even called a hashtag back in August of 2007 when he was going to an event called barkcamp it's a nerdy thing

499
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:55,328
It's an event that you go to that completely unstructured and unplanned and the participants figure it out

500
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,632
So the participants needed a way of organizing

501
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,704
Which led Chris to tweet the very first hashtag

502
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,520
Even though at that point it was just a pound sign

503
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,824
How do you guys feel about using

504
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Pound

505
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
Barkcamp

506
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:14,016
Four groups putting a pound sign in front of the word barkcamp helps the other people at bar

507
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:20,416
Pick out the word Barr camp in their Twitter stream and encourages all the other bar Camp distance to use

508
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,816
Barkcamp in their tweets

509
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:33,216
Invitation says some people got on board and agreed to use the pound

510
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:39,616
But most were like okay you go do that the pound symbol had already probated other corners

511
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:46,016
The Web Internet relay chat AKA IRC use the pound sign to represent chat rooms or Converse

512
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
Versation channels

513
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,368
There's another Haiku that also have these channels

514
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,928
So there was other stuff that came before me

515
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,000
But Chris was using bunch of pound signs throughout his tweets

516
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
I was putting

517
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Pound symbol

518
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
In front of my words

519
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
If you were like I don't understand what you're doing

520
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
You're putting all this strange punctuation in

521
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
Stop and

522
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
It looks.

523
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,776
But the True Believers stood by the sign

524
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,080
One Twitter user called it a hash

525
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
Tag

526
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,408
Because hash is the British name for the sign

527
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
And these are being used as category

528
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:21,600
Tags

529
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,184
Anacortes directly but they thought it would never catch on the look clunky

530
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,512
Then a few months later in October of 2007

531
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,328
The purpose of the hashtag was fully realized

532
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
A friend of mine was down in

533
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:39,776
San Diego isn't even a traitor and he was using Twitter basically pulling all the stuff together around these fire that we're going

534
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
San Diego

535
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,944
San Diego

536
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,344
He was fixing all of his tweets with Sans face Diego space fire

537
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,208
Switch to hashtag San Diego fire all one word and then other users would imitate him

538
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
And it worked

539
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,584
People trying to find out about the fire do exactly where to look on Twitter

540
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,192
And this was a moment where everyone went oh that's what these signs are for

541
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
Clarify

542
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,592
Hashtags were nothing that Twitter planned on and they coming to drag their feet on incorporating it

543
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
We kept thinking

544
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,920
There must be a better way to organize all this information

545
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
What's going through Twitter

546
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
I'm weak I'm looking for a week

547
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
Really found it

548
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,272
What the hashtag

549
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
Andy Lawrence

550
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,904
Let an employee at Twitter officially brought in the hashtag

551
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,976
The users brought in the hashtag what all I did was link

552
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
The hashtag

553
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
Twitter search

554
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
One line of code

555
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Took me about 15

556
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,608
Ask anybody

557
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:43,008
That one line of code meant that when you click on a word with a hashtag in front of it you'd see a page with all the other tweets that

558
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
Also contained that hashtag word

559
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,664
And basically this help you round up everyone was talking about a specific topic

560
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,992
And now the hashtag is a tool used in advertisements

561
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:57,856
Social movements music videos memes TV shows and in conversation

562
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
#sometimes

563
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,464
Hey Justin what's up

564
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
W

565
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,144
The busy working has a rising grind hashtag is it Friday yet even Chris acknowledges how irritating

566
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
She said aloud

567
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,336
Mostly when I'm being annoying or ironic but I'm I'm coming to sort of except that that's the phrase

568
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:24,736
It's getting to the point where the hashtag is erasing the symbols other uses friend of mine

569
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:31,136
He is delivery guy showed up and was looking for a hashtag to a hope that most people who made deliveries

570
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
For a living

571
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
#SMH

572
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,464
We know it more

573
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
The number song

574
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,560
In the states it's usually called the number sign

575
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
Call the pound sign

576
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,888
In the UK is often called a hash mark

577
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,936
Epic War because of the way it looks and everything else

578
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
This is Keith Houston

579
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,288
He's the author of a book called Shady characters

580
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
The Secret Life Of

581
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,128
A punctuation symbols and other typographical marks

582
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
I've got a whole chapter on this symbol

583
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,736
Anna has a lot of other

584
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,040
Random uses as well as used in chess

585
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,112
To represent remove the results in checkmate

586
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:08,256
In proofreading if you see a hash symbol this means space should be inserted here

587
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:14,656
It's used on Swedish maps to mean a Lumberyard hash pound number sign lumberyard

588
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,216
Whatever you want to call it however you want to use it

589
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,776
The symbol traces back to ancient Rome

590
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,104
The term Libra Pondo

591
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
Mint pounded weight

592
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
The word Libra

593
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
I like the constellation

594
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Weighing scales

595
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
Bounces

596
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
And pump

597
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
And Dairy Queen

598
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,088
Means to wait Libra Pondo

599
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:39,232
And these two names were interchangeable so Romans referred to this weight measurement as a Libra or a Pondo

600
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,280
So the word Libra was often abbreviated

601
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,096
Lowercase L lowercase b

602
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Which of course

603
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
We still use

604
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
5 l

605
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
You mean 5 Libra or 5

606
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Time is it

607
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,336
This is also why British currency the pound

608
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,664
Is represented by a stylized L for Libra

609
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,480
So the abbreviation lb becomes a thing

610
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,552
And oftentimes it was drawn with a little bar

611
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
Across the top

612
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Both letters

613
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,904
Just to show that the L and the B were connected

614
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
Scribes

615
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,720
A writer is garbage

616
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,768
Peerless Saloon write faster and faster

617
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
Faster

618
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
Do the pandas leave the paper

619
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
Fort Douglas

620
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
Bar across the top

621
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,216
Answer this seems to have given

622
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:27,104
Rise to the pound symbol for hash mark or Lumberyard overtime the symbols meaning started it by 4

623
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:33,248
It was used like lb for the unit pound and also started to be used as a number sign

624
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,040
It had a lot of various uses

625
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
What is important enough

626
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
To wind up falling

627
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
Typewriter keyboard

628
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
Which is

629
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:43,744
Kind of that the keys thing is the thing that symbol had to do in order to survive

630
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,840
Symbols that didn't make it onto a typewriter keyboard got pretty unpopular

631
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,400
Like the interrobang the pilcrow

632
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
Manicure

633
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
4 things

634
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,776
Fast forward to 1963

635
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,592
The invention of the touch-tone telephone

636
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,992
Hi this is a bell systems new at Stone Valley

637
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
Rotary wheel

638
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:10,624
So unlike previous phones the numbers didn't have to be arranged in a circle on the dial anymore

639
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:19,328
Bell Laboratories a research subsidiary of AT&T experimented with a few different designs for the telephone keypad

640
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,936
They try to arranging the numbers into rows of 5 in a circle and a cross

641
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
Step pattern

642
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:30,080
But they ended up using the numbers 1 through 9 in a 3X3 grid

643
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,640
Can you put zero alone in the bottom center

644
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,200
Years later in 1968 they figured

645
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:41,600
Why not add keys to either side of the zero this would make the keypad into a rectangle

646
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,904
There's a few more options on the phone menu

647
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,696
To repeat these options

648
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
Press the star key

649
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,792
Because unlike rotary phones

650
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,864
Touch-tone phones allow you to continue to dial

651
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,656
After the connection has been made

652
00:28:55,168 --> 00:29:01,312
So you could punch in extensions and navigate automated menus

653
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
Press 2

654
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,408
Originally Bell Labs wanted

655
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,712
Pretty shapes on the two extra buttons

656
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,552
That made prototype phone that had a five pointed star and a diamond

657
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:17,952
On either side of the zero Doug Kerr would have none of this diamond and five point star business

658
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:21,280
Because by that time a new thing and coming to the picture

659
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:27,936
The possibility of customers dialing directly from their phones into a computer for such things as checking bank balance

660
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,240
Cesare validating their credit cards or what have you

661
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:35,360
Doug Kerr wanted to make sure that the two new symbols will be once a computer could recognize

662
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,200
Ones that appear on a keyboard and we're part of the computers vocabulary

663
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:45,600
So there would be no uncertainty about how a certain button would be recorded in the data that went into the

664
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:52,000
Computer Bell Labs was pretty set on their star and Diamond idea so the compromise was an ass trick for the star in

665
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,304
In a pound for the diamond because

666
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
You know the

667
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Center

668
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:02,496
How to look Diamond like I guess for a second AT&T was like can we at least call it a diamond

669
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
The call that symbol diamond

670
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:08,128
It's not a diamond at all AT&T didn't know what to call this button in their manuals

671
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,712
And this led to the creation of what some people including Keith Houston

672
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,760
Consider the symbols official name

673
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,064
The octothorpe the octothorpe

674
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,368
One day I was out with my

675
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
Engineering partner

676
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,304
And we got to talking about it and thought maybe we should come up with a new name this is like to work in marketing for AT&T

677
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
During the time

678
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,376
Ian is engineering partner look at the symbol

679
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:33,728
And saw that I had eight line sticking out of it in there

680
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,776
Tendentious autofit hair weave

681
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,360
The RP

682
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,640
In there too

683
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,200
Because it sounds kind of Greek ashamed

684
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
Davidson statue

685
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,880
They called it an octothorpe but that morphed into octothorpe with rumor has it came about because someone involved

686
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,720
Change the name to turn it into a tribute to Olympic Athlete Jim Thorpe

687
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,000
But no one really knows

688
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
G is it proper to spell it

689
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,096
Octave Thorpe rather than Thorpe

690
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
There is no proper

691
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,680
Doug called it an octothorpe

692
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,960
Lauren called it a knock

693
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,496
Dother buttock

694
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Joe Thorpe

695
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,824
Seems to have the most widespread use

696
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
There with you is not widely

697
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:18,272
Originally the only reason octothorpe ever caught on with him Bell Labs was because Engineers thought it was funny joke

698
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
The manufacturer Western elect

699
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
Totally hated that name

700
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,392
And pretty much killed in the 70s

701
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,440
But today for a lot of type of fishing out

702
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
Octothorpe

703
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
Is the signs real

704
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,536
In typography

705
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
Is the name Hughes

706
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,864
You might think

707
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:37,728
Topographic nerds like Keith love it because it feels the most neutral and official

708
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,032
Been to this symbol whatever it's called

709
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,848
Doug Kerr and the other Bell Labs engineers

710
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:47,200
Really understood that we would be using telephones to communicate with computers

711
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:51,552
And this is exactly the same reason why Chris Messina chose to use this symbol

712
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,600
Back in that tweet in 2007

713
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,392
At the time we had

714
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,928
Blackberry Smirnoff

715
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
Neither Hardware base

716
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,768
Best keyboards

717
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,608
SMS because that's the way that I'm going to be publishing Twitter

718
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:08,192
Which left Chris only two choices the star with a pound

719
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
Whatever

720
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
It's

721
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
Probably one of the most dense symbols

722
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,384
And so when you're reading a sentence while you're reading a tweet

723
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,784
It stands out hashtags on promotional materials on other social media platform

724
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
Amazon protest signs

725
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,464
In your annoying friends conversations

726
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,768
And this is all probably going to sound

727
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,072
Sarah dated in like 5 years

728
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
For two years

729
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,376
Or maybe a few months

730
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:43,520
Hearing hashtag out loud I'm going to sound like someone reading a telegram

731
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:50,176
My office instructed to advance you up to $25,000 stop and Merry Christmas

732
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,736
Sam Wainwright in a telegram has on Twitter

733
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:57,344
Are speech changed to accommodate the machines

734
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,160
Changing our language to be more computer friendly

735
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,768
And what we're needing to do is actually invert the Paradigm where the computers become more friendly to Human
