2016

29
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,504
So

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,320
What's happening here where are you what is going on in the state

31
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:33,440
So I was getting ready to go to IBM's headquarters in San Jose Calif

32
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,512
I was going to this presentation to about

33
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
20 people

34
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
I am

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,144
Way more nervous than I thought I would be

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,912
But

37
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
It's happening

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,264
I'm just going to practice

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
Running through a

40
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Little

41
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,616
Planned script I have

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,688
So tell us what this presentation is about

43
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,248
So I was getting ready to make a presentation

44
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,272
For something that

45
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
Approved

46
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:03,136
Would be used by millions of people all around the world he would change

47
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,744
Every last cell phone tablet and laptop all around

48
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,048
Alright I'm sold

49
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
What is it

50
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,400
Okay so it was a proposal for a brand new

51
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Emoji

52
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
You know those little pictograms we used to text

53
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Each other

54
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,336
Thumbs up the woman dancing for the little yellow faces that

55
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Smile

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Winker

57
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
It works sunglasses

58
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,296
Okay I know what an emoji is Mark Z's I'm not battle

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,536
You sound so nervous I know it's

60
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,584
Really really embarrassing

61
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
I'll let you know how it goes

62
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,360
Okay so before you tell us what your emoji was and what they got approved

63
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
I feel like

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
We should start with something like

65
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
Why why am I doing this whole thing

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,528
Exactly why are you doing this all day

67
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
Right so

68
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,160
Create Emoji it was not too because I actually planned on

69
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:13,792
But you do cover this stuff you have a podcast called Welcome to Macintosh you cover things like the intersection of Tech & Co

70
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
Culture and service seems to be part of your be

71
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,656
Exactly and you know I think emoji

72
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,448
They're kind of right at that intersect

73
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
They've become this

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,800
Really interesting part of the way that we communicate

75
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
There's kind of

76
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,896
Universally spoken language of pictures

77
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,688
But going into all this

78
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,248
I didn't really know that much about emoji

79
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
So I reached out to Jeremy Burger

80
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,600
He's the creator of emojipedia

81
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
My job is

82
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
Keeping on top of any new emojis and serve documenting how they change over time so it's her a real

83
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,632
Set of History lesson. Emoji they started in Japan in the 90

84
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:57,056
The first set of emojis was designed for a Japanese cell phone company by this guy named chica Taco Cody.

85
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
In 1998

86
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,152
When texting was still really new

87
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,992
There's only a hundred seventy six of them and they were 12 by 12 pixels

88
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,088
So that's really low rats for an emoji that's super Lopez

89
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:13,184
But these were like the first images that can be sent by a text message

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
Before photos or anything like that

91
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
You see the Japanese Wednesday

92
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,167
Very basic abstract pixel art

93
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
So these super low res emojis

94
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
Became really popular in Japan

95
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
And quickly

96
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
Almost all Japanese text messages became

97
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
Dotted with these cute little pictures

98
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,759
But they were still only available on Japanese cell phone

99
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,343
Depending on which carrier people in Japan were using

100
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,159
These emojis could be different from phone to phone

101
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
That's that's a problem

102
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,887
It seems like in our modern world of computers

103
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
This should not be happening

104
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:02,335
But the reason that this was happening was that when different cell carriers in Japan added these images for their customers

105
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
The encoded them

106
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:09,759
So when are you taking just a minute to explain what character encoding is this is Mark Davis

107
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,599
Every time you see a character on the screen on your

108
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
Mobile or laptop

109
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,207
It's always represent internally by a number

110
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
So there's some number associated with the letter A

111
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,327
So the problem in Japan was that

112
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
The companies weren't coordinating about

113
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,935
What emojis were assigned to what number

114
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,751
So one company might have the hamburger in coded as

115
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
46790

116
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,663
Well another carrier would have the Pooh raincoat it is 44790

117
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,735
So when American cell phone companies decided that

118
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
They wanted to enter the Japanese Market

119
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
They do that thing he did the coating for these emojis to become standardized and they turn to Mark and his organization

120
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,743
A group called the Unicode

121
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,095
I'm the president of chicken care Consortium

122
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,631
People behind the curtains

123
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
Making sure that everything works

124
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,055
Can like plumbers you know you don't notice them as long as the water keeps flowing

125
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,871
They're doing the 99% invisible work

126
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
The internet

127
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
If you will

128
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,223
I guess all that was

129
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,575
So the Unicode Consortium had already been working on standardization for a while

130
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,623
Emoji with text

131
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,207
The Consortium was founded back in the early days of the internet

132
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,303
When there is no Universal standard for encoding texter

133
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
Anything else you saw online

134
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:34,239
People at the time we're really used to getting emails or looking at websites and they would see.

135
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,591
Jumbled up garbage on the screen because it was the wrong encoding

136
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,967
The internet used to be so ugly like when you were baby you don't even know the internet

137
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,807
Yeah I have I have heard stories

138
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,367
Unicode they were founded to help with that

139
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
Most of the work has to do with length

140
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
You're making sure

141
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,767
But even little known languages are legible across

142
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Websites and Platt

143
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:03,935
That seems totally fair that make the World Wide Web worldwide make sure everyone can be represented

144
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
And ultimately

145
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,055
Unicode became the be-all end-all text encoding

146
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,871
So since people were already relying on your coat

147
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
Standardized testing coding

148
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:18,271
I thought why don't we get these guys to do Emojis for us to

149
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Though

150
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,623
When Unicode was first approached about emojis in the early 2000s

151
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
They weren't interested

152
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,207
They thought that these cute little pictures

153
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
They're probably a passing fad

154
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:34,143
I think we were all kind of hoping and praying for that emojis are here to stay

155
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
And Fighters later around 2006

156
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
Unicode realized emojis were not going any

157
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
So they decided to take on the project of standardizing

158
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
So they looked at

159
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,479
All the different emoji that have been created by the Japanese carriers

160
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
Sorting through them to establish

161
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
An initial core Library

162
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
So what was in that original set of emojis

163
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
It was

164
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
Kind of a hodgepodge

165
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
2 camels

166
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:05,119
That for mailboxes 5 train

167
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,983
It's really important and so once they had that core Library

168
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,055
Unicode decided that all additional emojis

169
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
Should be considered very careful

170
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,663
And voted on and approved by Davis and the rest of the

171
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
No more

172
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
Two camels

173
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
Slipping through the cracks

174
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,367
Each emoji that we encode we really have to think does this sort of break new ground

175
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,463
Does it isn't going any direction is it going to be

176
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,279
Extremely popular because we know the faces for exam

177
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
You know the parts are very popular and so

178
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,959
So we try to wail these factors when we pick us up

179
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,335
Guys really do pick all the emojis that are on my phone that they they are the ones who decide

180
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Yeah yeah exactly

181
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
4 times a year

182
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,991
Unicode meets to consider all the proposal they have for new emoji

183
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,319
And they are the final say in which ones are free

184
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
And once an emoji is approved

185
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
It never goes away

186
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
Emoji can only be added

187
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,255
Once an emoji always an emoji

188
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Get out

189
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,631
And who comes up with these new ideas for emojis like who gets to submit proposals

190
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,679
So I had this question 2

191
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,751
And I asked Jeremy the guy from emojipedia

192
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,103
And this is what turned this story from idle curiosity

193
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
Into a year-long

194
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
The Proposal

195
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
Like who is actually

196
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
Responsible for

197
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
Bringing these

198
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,831
Emoji into the world

199
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
Richly anybody anyone on the planet

200
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,671
Can send a proposal in right now

201
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,279
Unicorn would look at it and there's a chance that it could become an actual emoji

202
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
So so like

203
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
I could do

204
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
Like I could send

205
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
I could send it

206
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Yes

207
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
So of course

208
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
When Jeremy told me that

209
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,103
I knew that I had to submit a proposal for an emoji

210
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,175
What better way to understand the process been to go through it myself

211
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
But

212
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
I didn't really have an idea for

213
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
What I wanted

214
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
Propose

215
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
So Jeremy gave me a few basic guidelines

216
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:07,999
You should be trying to prove this old ready to man before you got involved don't start a petition and generate demand

217
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,559
He said that Unicode wants people writing proposals

218
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
To cite evidence of demand like

219
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,167
#usage on Twitter Instagram

220
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Or Google search

221
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,287
He also said that my proposed Emoji it should be visually distinct

222
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:25,663
If it looks the same as something else it doesn't matter if it means something different emojis about what they look like

223
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
But

224
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
Two specific

225
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:32,831
But it can't be for this one really specific kind of dinosaur whatever

226
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,135
And at the opposite end of the spectrum

227
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
It can't be too big

228
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,487
Know if your emoji with just dinosaur

229
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
You might need more specificity

230
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
Like T-Rex

231
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,119
What's a pretty fine line but I think I can

232
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Okay

233
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Another thing

234
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
They don't want to add an emoji that

235
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Potentially just

236
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
A fad right I get that

237
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
That so you don't want an emoji of like a

238
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,639
I don't like a fidget spinner or something like that

239
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Yeah yeah exactly

240
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,687
Fidget spinners

241
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
Who knows how long those will be

242
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
You also can submit logos

243
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Brands

244
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
Pacific people deities

245
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
Etcetera Superman and Batman

246
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:12,511
Starbucks and those are just not going to be included they have to be generic

247
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
They're already like

248
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:19,935
Do you thousand emojis right there's 2666 as of hasn't recorded

249
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:27,615
If you're not going to do Batman and Superman what doesn't exist yet that you could actually propose

250
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
So I actually asked Jeremy this

251
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
What do people really really want

252
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
And this is what he

253
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
Sorry

254
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
There is a yoga

255
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:42,975
Because what's up popular activity little lot of people around the world do if somebody decided to submit yoga and all meditating

256
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
I think that would

257
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Eclectic

258
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
So

259
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
I'll be honest

260
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
I've never done you

261
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,471
I never meditated strong feelings about either one

262
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
But

263
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
I wanted to pitch in emoji

264
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:02,687
And this had good odds of being approved so namaste

265
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
I went I went full Namaste on

266
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:09,343
All kinds of research about yoga and meditation

267
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:15,999
Did you know for example Roman that there are 35 million Instagram post with hashtag yoga compared to

268
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
#running

269
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,863
Paltry 31 million

270
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,423
There have to be an emoji for yoga SF

271
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
What would you use to represent that

272
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:31,615
So I actually decided to go with an image that I felt represented both meditation and yoga

273
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
A person in Lotus

274
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,735
I'm at the one where you said cross-legged and you have your hands

275
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,599
Face up on each near and yeah

276
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Famous

277
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
Cross-legged sitting

278
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Yeah and so

279
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,743
I found some clipart on the internet to illustrate

280
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
What the Emoji might look like

281
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,351
And in the end I put together this eight page proposal

282
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
To submit to you

283
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
I don't pretty good about it but

284
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,263
I wanted to run it by someone would actually gone through the process

285
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:04,383
My name is Jenna Fraley and Isaac's actually proposed a 🥟

286
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,991
Her middle name is actually the number 8 which is so cool and she was actually in an episode that we did about

287
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Fortune cookie

288
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,319
Yeah and she actually successfully made of

289
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,111
A 🥠 as well

290
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Anyway

291
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
Back in 2015

292
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,255
When we was working on getting the 🥟 added into

293
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
She learns that Unicode is this nonprofit

294
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,655
But it is controlled by a small handful of

295
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,823
Yeah that one hit 11 full voting members of $18,000 a year to vote so

296
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,151
11/8 of them were us multinational company

297
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:41,247
Does oracle IBM Google Apple Facebook Yahoo

298
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
Microsoft and Adobe

299
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
Of the other three

300
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
They were the German software company sap

301
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,511
The Chinese Telecom company Huawei and the government of Oman

302
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,303
Did she say the government of Oman

303
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
Yeah because

304
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
Remember most of what Unico does has nothing to do with emoji and mostly to do with in coding language on the

305
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:08,127
So the government is there to advocate for greater Arabic language support on computer

306
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
Oh that makes

307
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Yeah

308
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
And now we is a part of the Emoji subbed

309
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,623
You can't vote on which Emoji get approved but she is able to help novices like

310
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Myself

311
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
Navigate the difficult path

312
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
Two emojis

313
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,511
So I showed her my proposal

314
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
It looks

315
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,839
Pretty solid yes

316
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,655
But I think your emoji characters are little bit ugly

317
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
No

318
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
Well

319
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
You did use clipart

320
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Fair

321
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,919
Fair probably not the standard of emoji characters I don't know where you got them but you might do them

322
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,783
In more like either the APA style or more of the Google style she was right

323
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
My design

324
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
Was not great

325
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
So

326
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
I ditched these clipart images

327
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
And hired a professional

328
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
A woman named Abby Messer

329
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
Just to let my case would be stronger

330
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,863
And unicode would have a better idea of what this Emoji could look like

331
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,655
I polished my proposal

332
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
Person meditating

333
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
And submitted it

334
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
Wright Avenue

335
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
And then a few weeks later

336
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,639
So I'm just coming into the studio now I just got an email

337
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
From unicode

338
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
She let me load it up

339
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Says

340
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,671
The Emoji subcommittee has decided to forward your proposal to the UTC

341
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,767
Docket number will BL2 / 16 -

342
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,303
279

343
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Regards

344
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
All right

345
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
All right that's it

346
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,895
So that sounds like good news but what does that actually mean basically means that I got through the first round

347
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,199
That Unicode was going to hold

348
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
Unofficial vote on my emoji

349
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,087
And at this point you know you can sit back and see what happens

350
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
Or if you are extra excited

351
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Like I was

352
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,999
You can actually show up to a quarterly meeting of the Unicode technical committee

353
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,047
And present your proposal in real

354
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
Is it that brings us back to you being

355
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
Super nervous before your presentation

356
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
Back in November

357
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
Okay

358
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
It is Monday

359
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
November 7th

360
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,895
2016

361
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
Today is the day that I'm presenting to the Unicode

362
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
Technical committee

363
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
But before we get to that

364
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,159
I want to talk about someone I met while I was there in the Bay Area

365
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,975
She was also there to make a presentation to you

366
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
Her name is Rio Alameda

367
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,607
My name is Rafael from Brady I'm 15 years old

368
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,703
She's 15 years old like in high school and she wrote up one of these proposals like you did

369
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,751
Yeah this is

370
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
No small task

371
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,311
I've never written any

372
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,151
Proposals whatsoever the closest thing I've done we're lab report

373
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
Inside slots

374
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
But for real

375
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:55,039
This whole thing just had a totally different level of importance

376
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,135
You mean that some people do this not just to make up cool radio psoriatic

377
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
Folkyeah

378
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,231
Because emojis represent culture

379
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,327
And just like it matters to see a representation of your culture in

380
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
Television in the movies

381
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,959
Turn yourself in an emoji can feel important in the same way

382
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
I mean

383
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,775
Humans all over the world Shenzhen like

384
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:20,127
6 billion of these little things to each other everyday totally there everywhere

385
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Yeah

386
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,455
And so in The Last 5 Years

387
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,015
Unicode has tried to represent more people

388
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
By adding

389
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
Characters with a range of different skin tone

390
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:33,695
They batted some gay characters and gender-neutral androgynous ones as well

391
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,511
But there was still no one that looks like Ray you

392
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Because

393
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
She wears a hijab

394
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,143
Aikido be nice for me to

395
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,471
On the keyboards

396
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
That I could use

397
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:52,895
Felt like her Emoji would help other women who wear hijabs feel more represented in mainstream

398
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:59,807
Even though it is something small I think it will you notice normalize the hijab you'll definitely be

399
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
That might be the coolest like

400
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,135
Coolest kids

401
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
I like it because it does

402
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:10,303
Pause I just told her friends were going to have to sell cupcakes

403
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,839
Even for the teachers

404
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
It be something so amazing

405
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Hopefully desk

406
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,471
Well now I'm totally rooting for you

407
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,615
Choose more than one rabbit you can root for us both if it's between you and her

408
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
It's definitely her

409
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
Okay that's that's fair that's

410
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,575
So are you tonight we're both presenting to Unicode on the same day

411
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,927
11:30

412
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,327
When it was my turn they made me turn off my microphone

413
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
So I don't have tape of what I say

414
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,959
But basically I gave a little spiel about

415
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,775
Why the world was in dire need of a yoga emoji

416
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,847
I got a few laughs heads

417
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,407
It lasted about 5 minutes

418
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
Then I took a few question

419
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,503
After it was over I stood there

420
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,295
Waiting for some indication of

421
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087
Weather in the committee liked it

422
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
And if they like it

423
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
They wouldn't say

424
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,231
Finally someone told me basically you need to leave so we can vote

425
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
I left

426
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,095
I just figured that they'd be in touch soon

427
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
Okay yeah

428
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,983
So if your emoji is approved

429
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
Then what happens next

430
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,383
So even though I submitted this really beautiful visual for my person meditating emoji

431
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,711
It's really more just to demonstrate what it could look like

432
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
Ultimately

433
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
If emojis approved

434
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,111
Google Facebook and apple and all other platforms

435
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:43,487
Will get to decide what exactly person meditating looks like in their own platform Style

436
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,791
So I talk to someone from Google

437
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,143
My name is Rachel being I'm a creative director at Google

438
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
On the material design team

439
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Butts

440
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,239
She has another title

441
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
Oh yes

442
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,103
I am also

443
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Funnily enough

444
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
The creative director of emoji

445
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Google

446
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:08,319
Once Rachel bean and her team get the list of new emojis and their codes from unicode

447
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,903
Those are the images to be used on all of Google's Android phone

448
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,719
And what kind of guidance do they get from Unicode about

449
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
How to draw them how to make them look

450
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,815
Right so they don't actually give them

451
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:24,703
All that much they give them the name of the emoji and a few key words of things that might represent

452
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
Occasionally they might give

453
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
A little bit of guidance of

454
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
You know

455
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,103
The Bagel Emoji it should be drawn slice

456
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,407
So that people won't confuse it with the donor

457
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
To it

458
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,503
So that makes it so that Google emojis

459
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,551
I'm different from Apple emojis and they look

460
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,367
Twitter emojis are all different

461
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
Exactly

462
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
Characters might be facing in a

463
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
Different direction

464
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,791
A different outfits on or maybe dancing another Style

465
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,863
But it's all illustrate the same basic con

466
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
And recently

467
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,495
Rachel be in entertainment Google have redesigned the entire Library

468
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
Of Android

469
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,823
Broly emojis that weren't

470
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,103
Disembodied faces

471
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
The team had to deeply consider

472
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,943
All the clothing and accessories that they were

473
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
Because

474
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,271
Designing for a global audience

475
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,575
Take for example the farmer

476
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:18,976
Originally we had designed the farmer Emoji very American Gothic style

477
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
So

478
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Pitchfork

479
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,072
And wearing overalls

480
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
But

481
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,888
A lot of farmers all around the world

482
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
They don't actually use

483
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
Pitchforks

484
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,264
It's kind of an old and very American characterization

485
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
And also the overalls to some degree

486
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,176
Weren't necessarily the outfit the most Farmers globally where

487
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,528
So you change the actual profit the farmer was holding into a grain

488
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,344
So to really put more emphasis on what

489
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,184
Grown University versus tools that may not be universally used

490
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,512
And this kind of global inclusivity

491
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,096
Is the same stuff they'll have to consider with the Emoji that I propose

492
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
You know other person meditate

493
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
What will it wear

494
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,216
Like what's the color of the clothing

495
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
Is

496
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,288
He or she or they going to be wearing

497
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
Games

498
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
Leotard tshirt

499
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,688
You know it's good that they're thinking about this but

500
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,552
The Google designers and never going to really be able to fairly represent all culture

501
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
Right

502
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,880
And unicode is this governing body with

503
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,160
A bunch of Representatives

504
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,696
But they're all mostly from these

505
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
Big Tex

506
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,536
And so this whole system it

507
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Kind of works.

508
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,400
Is not a good system you shouldn't have to ask these people's permission

509
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,032
This is Keith winstein I'm Keith winstein I'm an assistant professor of computer science here Stanford

510
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,640
And he says if there is not an emoji that represents you order

511
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Your culture

512
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,736
Unicode process for getting one is not exactly

513
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:49,344
But having to wait until two or three years for it to end up in the standard and that's a long time

514
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
It doesn't take

515
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,208
Quite that long anymore it's closer to 1 or 2 years

516
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
But still

517
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,816
Winston points out that are already platforms like

518
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,888
Swac that let you take an image and make an emoji size

519
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:08,288
You don't need to go through Unicode yeah totally because a critical stat on our staff he does this any makes a

520
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,616
Mod for every episode of we shared when the episode comes out

521
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,944
And is this a little picture it's not really an emoji

522
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Exactly

523
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,784
And so there is no special encoding process

524
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
Required to make

525
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,136
This is a much simpler way of doing it rather than trying to cram everything into

526
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Unicode

527
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,256
And even though I think Winston gets at some really important criticisms

528
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,072
If we went to a system where we really just sent

529
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
Tiny pictures

530
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,656
Then the things that I really love about emojis

531
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
What kind of bee loss

532
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,496
Which is that they turned into this store

533
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,312
Universal standardized language of pictures

534
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:47,968
Like the idea that some stranger in Argentina and I are both sending a 😍 to express love

535
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
Think there's something really cool about that

536
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,856
That is a nice quality to another Universal

537
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,696
So so what happened with your meditating person you must know by now

538
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
So for a few days after my presentation

539
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
I still haven't heard anything

540
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,864
No email thanking me for my proposal 1

541
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,912
Letting me know when I hear back or

542
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Anything you like

543
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,728
It was just total radios

544
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,568
And then I was just scrolling on Twitter

545
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,872
I'm so I just saw

546
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,688
That emojipedia has a

547
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,504
Tweeted about some of the new emoji

548
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
Paige

549
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880

We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

585
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824

598
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,320
Makes for a much more natural experience
