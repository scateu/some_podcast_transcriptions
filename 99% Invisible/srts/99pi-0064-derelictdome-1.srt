Each episode of Family ghosts takes a look at the story behind a different person's family lore digging into

10
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,936
Unanswered questions about their history

This is 99% invisible

17
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,096
I'm Roman Mars

18
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
It's safe to say that Woods Hole is exactly what you picture when you think of a town on Cape Cod

19
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
Old houses covered in Wood shingles are sailboats Oceanside restaurants

20
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,320
Super traditional super East Coast

21
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:34,720
Town There's this huge Dome it looks like a three-story tall golf ball it's this crazy looking

22
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,072
Totally out of place next to the Old Colonial houses

23
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
The reporter Kelly Clarkson went to check it out

24
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
Hello

25
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,240
Katie brought some friends to

26
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
The back door was unlocked

27
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,336
Like it's not like anything you've ever seen before

28
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,896
Inside it smells musty

29
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
It's creepy

30
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
Look at this old

31
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
Wallpaper

32
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,064
There's a wall made entirely out of the

33
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,136
Interlocking triangle shaped windows

34
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,952
The cast of web of Shadows on the floor

35
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
There's an old kitchen

36
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,816
It looks like it might have been part of a restaurant

37
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
I found some

38
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,400
Yeah there's a whole pile of Old Salt and Pepper Diner

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
When we left

40
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
I needed to know more

41
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:28,736
What Katie found with a geodesic dome designed and built by the late Buckminster Fuller

42
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136
Don't feel bad if you never heard of Bucky he did go by Bucky by the way big deal back in the 60s

43
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:41,536
Drawing of Bucky's head made to look like one of his domes was on the cover of Time magazine in 1964

44
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
There's a Bucky Fuller postage stamp

45
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,168
He was even given the country's highest civilian honor

46
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
Presidential medal of freedom

47
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,616
Bucky Fuller is also responsible for the title of this radio show he said 99% of who you are is invisible

48
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:02,016
Civil and Untouchable fan he discussed the 99% invisible activity that is coalescing to Roche Park

49
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,576
Our future he's a very quotable man

50
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,976
He is from the film Buckminster Fuller the Lost interviews

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
To do mall was last

52
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,400
So that you might sometimes do so much with so little they might be able to take care of everybody

53
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,216
And make all the politics invalid

54
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,544
Jay Baldwin was one of Bucky students

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,616
He just wanted people to use less stuff

56
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
He said it was all going to run out

57
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
We gotta think big

58
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,552
And take care of everybody said as long as there's one person starving

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
You're going to have wars

60
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,208
Fuller called himself a comprehensive anticipatory design scientist

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,072
She wanted to invent things that would make human life sustainable on this planet

62
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:51,168
Decades before anyone else was even thinking about Green Building

63
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:57,568
And for that people have called Bucky the Leonardo DaVinci of the 20th century

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
Devore Institute crew

65
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
Counters that Leonardo was the bucket

66
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
Before medieval times

67
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
So here's the deal with the Woods Hole Dome

68
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
Buggy wanted to change the world

69
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
Starting with building

70
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,232
So he started making these weird structures which he called geodesic dome

71
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
Geodesic refers to the geometry of Curves

72
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Surfaces

73
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,935
The golf ball building in Woods Hole is actually the oldest of Buc-ee's domes that are still standing

74
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,775
The structure of the geodesic dome is based on a lot

75
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
Complicated math

76
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,639
But I'm sure it's dealt with a lot of triangles

77
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,455
A triangle is a very strong shape

78
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,015
And a dome made out of triangles

79
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Is extra strong

80
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,159
That meant that domes could be made of lighter and cheaper materials than normal building

81
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,463
Like plastic and aluminum

82
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Instead of Steel and concrete

83
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,095
Back in 1952 but he was just starting to build them

84
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,471
They caught the attention of an architect and aspiring restaurant or a man named Gunnar Peterson

85
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:04,127
And the early 50s 1953 he bought some property in Woods Hole in

86
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,431
Decided to build a hotel in a restaurant

87
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
Joe Peterson is Gunner son

88
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,527
He did make a deal with Bucky Fuller

89
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,831
I don't remember how dad Madame he

90
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,463
Call the track him down anyway his wife

91
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,255
Came and looked at our house

92
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,071
They decided they build the Dome restaurant

93
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,935
A geodesic dome has a way of standing out but in Cape Cod it really

94
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Stands out

95
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
And that upset some people

96
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,311
Wow it isn't there shingled Cape Cod Cottage

97
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
That's for darn sure

98
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
I'm in the feeling is this is going to

99
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,271
Change Life as we know it you know this again I will never be the same again you know this is just

100
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Horrible

101
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
One building

102
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
There was

103
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,463
Stuff that happened there was things stolen from you I mean it was

104
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
Paint poured on things that what that was

105
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
There was just

106
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
Lots of stuff

107
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
Stuff here meaning

108
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
People didn't want to talk about this on tape

109
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,495
But I just have this mental image of a really ugly mob up in arms about this

110
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
Dome

111
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
That's probably an exaggeration but

112
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
You get the idea

113
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,967
Despite the unrest the Dome restaurant opened in June of 1954

114
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
And according to Joel it was the place

115
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,319
To go on was

116
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,903
The most elegant place around I mean at that time

117
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,999
Shortly when you went out to eat in the 50s on Cape Cod

118
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
In a place like the dawn

119
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,399
You are tie in the women wear all spiffed-up it was a festive

120
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
Occasion

121
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
And they had a live musician

122
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
She played the zither

123
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,079
And I don't know if you've ever had dinner with soothing music

124
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
It's rather Pleasant

125
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,319
Restaurant is right on the ocean

126
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
And you're far away from City so he could just look up at the ceiling and you're looking at the star

127
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,983
Sally Brady was 14 years old when the Dome restaurant open your house

128
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
This early fifties we're really quite an amazing

129
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:15,711
Moment because everybody could buy cars people who survived the war all those men were home and they were job

130
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
10 people were

131
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,575
Making the American dream come true and I think that

132
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,647
A symbol of the America

133
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,487
Dream in a way it felt like a prosperous optimistic time

134
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,815
It makes sense that the Dome represented the future for some people

135
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,215
It turned out that there was some real structural problems with the Dome

136
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,543
First the structure acted like an acoustic amplifier

137
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,127
So all that zither music got blasted across the neighborhood

138
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,455
And a building was that much glass work like a greenhouse

139
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
Got hot inside

140
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:55,135
After the first season they cover the Dome and white fiberglass the block out the Sun

141
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
Diamond Diner couldn't see the Stars anymore

142
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
Geodesic domes don't have any support beam

143
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,351
Those triangular window frames do all the work

144
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,191
Each frame rests on the one next to it

145
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,543
What can be a problem if the building materials are flexible and move in the Wind

146
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,615
Here's Arnie grapes dad he worked at the restaurant

147
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
Saturday night

148
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
Horrible weather outside

149
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
And this particular night

150
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
There was a party of four

151
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:26,367
Lascala's Matt were they having dinner and they were regular customers local people

152
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
Around 7:30 with a

153
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
Shuffle restaurant

154
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
All of a sudden this.

155
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,815
Dropping a table 113 and I can remember it

156
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
Seeing them sit there

157
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
And Jane took her umbrella

158
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Opened it

159
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
To a huge

160
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Floss

161
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
From everyone in the restaurant

162
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
It was just funny

163
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
But the fact is

164
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
The geodesic domes most of them looked like

165
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,479
Say it again Jay Baldwin Bucky's former students

166
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,551
I have a photograph of Bucky inside is dumb

167
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
In Carbondale

168
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
With an umbrella in one hand

169
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
A book in the other

170
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
And a flashlight in his mouth

171
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
Reading the blur

172
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
And if the umbrella

173
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
Is needed

174
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,399
I told Becky I'm going to find out why I don't sleep

175
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
And he said

176
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,239
Don't sleep because they're made my amateurs

177
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,847
And they built it with holes in it you wouldn't build a boat with holes in it would u r r

178
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
I said I don't think they're leaking

179
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
Because they made a move

180
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
I said I think

181
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
Are leaking G

182
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
The owner Joel Peterson

183
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Does he pass

184
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
A lot of week

185
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,463
Eventually Joe wanted to retire from the restaurant business

186
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
He sold the property in 2002

187
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,327
It's been sitting vacant ever since

188
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
Ask Joel and Arnie to give me a tour

189
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,519
I can't bring myself to tell them I've actually been here before

190
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,615
We have to push aside branches to get to the front door

191
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
It's been a few years since I've been here

192
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
And

193
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,087
To tell you the truth I never really wanted to come because I mean

194
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,159
Babe is incredibly overgrown I mean it's just

195
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,487
Sad

196
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,119
My gosh isn't this amazing it actually is

197
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,239
I'll tell you what this is not a pretty sight

198
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,895
I told you about Ruth welcome in the zoo this is where she played

199
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,711
Now if you want take a look at the kitchen

200
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
There's a walking

201
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
This really has been like

202
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,231
I certainly I wouldn't mind seeing it restored on the other hand

203
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,071
Think it's going to be a tremendous expense to put this back

204
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
So it sits with two

205
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,447
Opposite emotions that you look at it

206
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
But you have to be realistic and

207
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,055
Understand that things change human life

208
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:01,247
In 2006 a real estate development company plan to build condos on the side

209
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,575
And for a while it looks like the Dome might be torn down

210
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
But then a funny thing happened

211
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,695
There was a public outcry to keep the Dome

212
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,999
This is the same building that residents fought against

213
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,327
Tooth and nail back when it was being constructed in the 50

214
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,167
Now in order to build on the site the developer have to

215
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
Store the Dome

216
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
And that's going to be a

217
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Expensive

218
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,591
So the whole thing is in limbo until more condos are pre-sold

219
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,431
And real estate transactions are not moving quickly these days

220
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,503
If a developer Camp FreeCell enough condos

221
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
To justify the cost of restoring the Dome

222
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
And the whole deal could fall apart

223
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,951
If that happened the Dome would stay as it is now

224
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
Continuing to the k

225
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,583
Waiting for the next out-of-towners to come poking around with a flashlight

226
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,167
The person who seems least sentimental about this

227
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
Is Joel Peterson

228
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
If I were doing the project that they

229
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Talk about doing

230
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
I tear it down

231
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Beyonce

232
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
It's it's

233
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,735
It's a building it was yeah it was part of my life it's a building

234
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,831
Sally Brady grew up next to the Dome feels differently

235
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
Maybe it will

236
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,439
Be reborn the different way that will be better

237
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Why not

238
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,303
Maybe you'll be a beautiful transparent place

239
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
People will go there and do

240
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
Fantastic energizing work

241
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
It will help Humana

242
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,287
What do you think we would lose if if it was torn down

243
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
What would you lose

244
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,943
Well it's very good example of this

245
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
450

246
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Boo

247
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
Anything was possible

248
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,135
Yeah I sort of agree and then and then what does it mean that now

249
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
It's just in such disrepair

250
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,023
Well I think it means that we

251
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
Groudon

252
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
And that dream

253
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
Sort of yeah I think it's

254
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,191
Kind of broken dream right now

255
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
Depressing isn't it

256
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Maybe it's finished

257
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Kinder

258
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,223
Buckminster Fuller claimed that his ideas were 50 years ahead of his time

259
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,575
Announcement over 50 years but domes have not replaced traditional building

260
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
But you know what

261
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
I'm rooting for the Dome

262
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,207
I think it represents Bucky's optimism

263
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,535
That we could solve The World's problems with good design

264
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,399
And even if you couldn't you could still stargaze through triangular windows

265
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Looking out

266
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
Over the sea

267
00:13:54,815 --> 00:14:00,191

Thanks also to Erin chesky

276
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:29,631
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world

277
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
Handmade sound

278
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
If

279
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

280
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,175
All hearing that voice

281
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
Technology talk to us

282
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271

285
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,719
To make them more human

286
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
Turn the living room lights on

287
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Okay

288
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,911
Dim the living room lights to 50%

289
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Okay

290
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,359
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

291
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,175
Makes for a much more natural experience

292
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,223
Turn the living room lights on

293
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
Dim the living room lights to 50%

Comic mystery

I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

317
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,823
Actually if I'm being honest

318
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,223
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing a few days ago Wesley Stern

After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop was found dead in my private gym

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had some
