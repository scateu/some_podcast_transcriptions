I'm Roman Mars

21
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,488
If you know anything about central European cities

22
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,536
When you hear Warsaw he think

23
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
Gray

24
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Ugly

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,680
Communist but there is a part of Warsaw that is anything but those things

26
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,496
The Old Town historic district

27
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,800
It just like any other quite European city

28
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,384
Tourist shops horse carriage rides Church fires

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
The buildings are beautiful

30
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,712
But actually

31
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
It's all fake

32
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,808
It just a replica of what once was

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,208
Like so many European cities during the second world war Warsaw was destroyed it had to be rebuilt

34
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,560
Now when you walk around the reconstructed historic part of Warsaw

35
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,144
You'll find these big glass mounted plaques on his way on the sidewalk

36
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,984
In the emerald painting so they start buildings in front of you

37
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:23,360
The first time I noticed one of these displays anniversary out street and I was completely drawn in

38
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,688
I study the painting and then I studied the building above

39
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
And just like I was set up to I thought

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,808
Wow they did an amazing job rebuilding it

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,648
But then later our reporter Amy just us Cafe found out

42
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,696
It's not quite like that

43
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
You're entering something which is effectively

44
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,792
A stage set

45
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
Intended to recreate

46
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,376
And I miss fear of a sudden.

47
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
But you're on your way over there

48
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
That's me how modovsky he was born in Warsaw

49
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
Now he's a social anthropologist

50
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
The Cambridge University

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,664
He told me about the incredible process of putting the city back together again

52
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,504
It's a challenge a lot of European cities were facing after the war

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,088
Warsaw's massive rebuilding of its entire medieval Old Town

54
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,696
Was lauded as one of the most impressive rebuilding post-war projects on the continent

55
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
They made it look to everyone

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
Like they reclaimed what was lost

57
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,704
But here's the thing Warsaw historic old town is not a replica of the real thing

58
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
And historic City

59
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
It never really was

60
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,872
So it's back up for the mystery

61
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,712
Sure Warsaw was damaged during the war as what other cities

62
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,552
That really worse off occupied by Nazi forces

63
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
Got hit particularly hard

64
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,904
One of the worst cases in the whole War

65
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,976
Practically the whole city was destroyed

66
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,584
People quibble about the exact statistics but most agree it was something like over 80

67
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
Percent of the core part of Warsaw

68
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
Really most of the city

69
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
Especially the part supposed considered important

70
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
Dupatta surviving pools for an 11th Hour attempt

71
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
Steak after capital

72
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
Hitler gave an order

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
Ossify Warsaw

74
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
Raise it

75
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
To the ground

76
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,088
Luma goes to high buildings

77
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
Disable using civilians. Doesn't work has pearls and Jewellers

78
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,327
They bite for today

79
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,887
2 days

80
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
Hi

81
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,855
The destruction was focused on the most important buildings in the nose

82
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Significant

83
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Historical buildings

84
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
Because day weather

85
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,839
Identify the past and national identity in that that was exactly what was identified as most important to get rid of

86
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:58,239
Warsaw burns the Soviets ready to take over after the retreating German forces

87
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,287
Stood on the other side of the river

88
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,431
Starling forces did nothing to help the polls in the Warsaw Uprising or save their City

89
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,271
It's not anyone in the instruction to fail because destroyed Warsaw

90
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,831
Would be that much easier to take over

91
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
Once the Germans were defeated

92
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
After the war

93
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
Warsaw is in ruin

94
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
Was liberated in January.

95
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
1945

96
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,839
And this is when the inhabitants. Coming back

97
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,655
Tool saw and the Zodiac descriptions info people

98
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,727
Can you show me the bags in the Han just wandering around

99
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Dazed

100
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,335
Unable to find their old homes and then unable to recognize anything

101
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,895
This wants muscle

102
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
Maybe again after a year

103
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,343
The true meaning of that battle will be assessed by soldiers and historian

104
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,463
Maybe a bigger and more beautiful city will be built on the road

105
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,815
DaVita Capital revenue and better problems

106
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
This one

107
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,655
Dinosaur jokes dead

108
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
Common chords

109
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,751
Andrew died in Bethel

110
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
Is to live forever

111
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,759
The first there was talk of giving up

112
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,063
Moving the capital to another city

113
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
But instead pulsus I didn't start over

114
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
Scratch

115
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,231
Much of the city was rebuilt according to communist

116
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
Cheap and big

117
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,375
Apartment blocks wide Avenues heavy gray buildings

118
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,447
Communist ideology in architectural form

119
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:39,359
But when it came to the historic district of Warsaw the old town and a long connecting section called The Royal route

120
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
They decided to restore not just rebuild

121
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
Anne Hathaway planners were going about it

122
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
Historians archaeologists

123
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
All the specialist involved

124
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,159
It really seemed like they're going to bring Old Warsaw

125
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
To life

126
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,511
There was this incredible focus on authenticity

127
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
In rebuilding the old town so

128
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,887
That was ready to give an emphasis for the Old Town

129
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
To be built from the same

130
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Physical matter

131
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
Has the old

132
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
So

133
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,055
That was a special kilums

134
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,359
What built on the outskirts of Louisville

135
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
Weather rubble from the old town

136
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
Was taken

137
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,503
I made into bricks from was the old time was to be rebuilt

138
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,831
I'm the bricks that were reusable that would just sort of lying

139
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
Around in the rubble

140
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,183
They were collected and they will clean the neighbors 2

141
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
Polished copper and a Wii used

142
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
Building these new old building

143
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
You took several years

144
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
But they did it

145
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,655
The new old town was first opened

146
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
People are happy

147
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Static have a back

148
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,567
Even in the last it was seen as a major accomplishment

149
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,639
A kind of Victory after all the destruction of the war

150
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,687
Triumph of the human spirit

151
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,783
The pictures from the time she was sort of Carnival as it was unveiled

152
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:56,671
You can see it from old photographs people are kind of joyfully wandering around this miraculous be recreated

153
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,231
Play Switchfoot have disappeared forever

154
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
This is something that made

155
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
Millions of people very happy

156
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,143
Thousands of people of Ordinary People participated

157
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,727
It was really a very successful kind of social solidarity exit

158
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
So the old city was brought back to life

159
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,943
How people started to notice something kind of strange

160
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
It seems like Old Warsaw

161
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
What's a little bit off

162
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
There are these descriptions.

163
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
David Crowley houston

164
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
Unemotional talks about

165
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:39,935
Of people who knew the old town before the war wandering around in density feeding this this kind of uncanny

166
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
Disjunction between

167
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
This is Heath. V remember them in the city.

168
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
They wandering around now

169
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,383
It was almost the same it felt incredibly

170
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,735
The first one is very closely to what they knew before but then something wasn't quite right

171
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,855
Remember what I said earlier about warsaw's Old Town not being a re-creation

172
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
But instead a reimagining

173
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,767
It turns out that despite all that effort to use exact same bricks from the rubble

174
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
That show of authenticity was just that

175
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
The show

176
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,655
Like morosky said before

177
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Disorder stage set

178
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
And this is

179
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,079
Highlights even more about the fact that United the passage that the couples

180
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
Everything seemed absolutely

181
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,431
Fine and then you wonder through the doorway

182
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,991
And you wonder into hectometers

183
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
Imagine

184
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Staircase

185
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
I'm heading to imagine flat

186
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
With this kind of

187
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,927
Historical experience hitting that there was this to very uncanny sense

188
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:40,351
It's not just the builders concentrated on the exteriors of the buildings and didn't bother creating what was by

189
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
Warsaw historic district

190
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
Was incredibly odd

191
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
By Design

192
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,031
Cuz actually it was different

193
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,871
It was never supposed to be exactly the same as it was

194
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
So

195
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:59,551
Visit this weird disjunction between this incredible and fishes and with intensity old bricks being reused and

196
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,111
Special K was being built for this purpose this

197
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
Big focus on on continuity

198
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
Physical continuity

199
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,999
But at the same time there was a very clearly stated

200
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,583
Idea that the Old Town shouldn't be the same old town

201
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,143
492 touchdown should be better than

202
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
So it should be a more perfect

203
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
Old Town

204
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,239
It existed before the war

205
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
Before the war ironically

206
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,383
Warsaw historic Old Town the slowly fading away on a

207
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,967
Before the word was basically

208
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
It was a slum it was more or less

209
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,855
It didn't have proper storage facilities I didn't have proper draining

210
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
It was basically lived in by very poor and Appleton

211
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,487
With a few kind of judges in and none of another see the cathedral was in

212
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
And the Royal costume

213
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,863
The beyond the castle Square the Old Town Square was the location first

214
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Haphazard Market

215
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
I'm looking into the table

216
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Is the prestigious

217
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
Had been

218
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
Ruined every time

219
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,615
But after the war reeling from loss piled upon loss

220
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
Historic Warsaw took on a new meaning

221
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,223
Now that it was missing completely

222
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,527
It had more power in Polish people's memory

223
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
And if it was around

224
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
No matter what

225
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
Set of the Communist way of thinking

226
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
The Old Town needed to be rebuilt

227
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
So that it could be

228
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Forgotten

229
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,399
The cynical argument is that the old town was rebuilt as assertive ideological camouflage so

230
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
In order to master

231
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
The fact that protein was being taken over by a certain

232
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
Alien power

233
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,615
This alien power decided to rebuild the old town to make it seem

234
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,895
Like they had some surgery

235
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
Extra Comfy Couch

236
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,015
Republic history wise in reality they was undermining everything undermining the old

237
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,551
The social structure

238
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,343
Everything that came before them

239
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
It's like this

240
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:44,511
If warsaw's historic Capital just got leveled over and replaced by grey ugly apartment blocks

241
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,327
People with long for what they were missing

242
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
They remember their significant

243
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Today

244
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
The seat

245
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Of the nation

246
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Cast

247
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
And not only longed for it

248
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
They make a martyr of it

249
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
The Terrace passed

250
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
Killed by communism

251
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
Are the Soviets

252
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,735
The same Soviets by the way you stood on the other side of the river and watched for saltburn

253
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,807
And the Communist whenever whenever the polls

254
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
In The Old City back

255
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
The Communists made it

256
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Hopefully their partner

257
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
Destruction

258
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
Forgettable

259
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Pass

260
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
Stop being such a distraction

261
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,119
And they can go about their business of overhauling the cut

262
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,447
So that's why they decided to rebuild the Old Town

263
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,287
But they didn't touch a way to keep their core ideals intact

264
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,847
And this is where it gets really weird

265
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,711
When city planners were looking for inspiration and had a better rebuild Warsaw

266
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
They went back further

267
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,575
And just before the war when the old town was far from its heyday

268
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,135
1930s

269
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
They look to the 1830s

270
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,767
Take one of the most famous streets in the old part of town

271
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
Devesh Fiat New World Street

272
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:56,191
For decades before the war nervous Fiat Street was one of the liveliest places in Warsaw

273
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
Hello shop

274
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
Cafes in hotels

275
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Overtime

276
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
Who wants uniform buildings there started to take on differ

277
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Heights

278
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
A different owners with extra levels

279
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Expand and improve

280
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:13,087
And then when it was rebuilt it was decided that this too too bustling capitalists in that got a Therrien

281
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
Atmosphere of no shots

282
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
It was improper

283
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,719
And so it was rebuilt effectively in the image of how it would have looked

284
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,999
In the early 19th century

285
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
In the city

286
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
Classicist

287
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
Lowe's Patio stair

288
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
Simple

289
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Style

290
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,935
I'm needle to buildings but where would you stay

291
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
Dua to three stories

292
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:34,335
Answer this is suitable to this is an attempt to make it into an egalitarian kind of enlightened Ministry

293
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
Rather than usage of nasty

294
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Capital

295
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
Cutthroat lese fast

296
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
Street that I have been in the in the 90s

297
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,551
And here's where it gets even weirder still

298
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,855
For other parts of Old Warsaw

299
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
Those for city planners went back further still

300
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
To the 7th

301
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
1800

302
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
Toy City

303
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
The never really existed

304
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,351
A city imagined by an Italian painter

305
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
Remember this sidewalk

306
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,727
Display as I mentioned earlier the ones that show pictures of Warsaw before the war

307
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,359
It turns out that the paintings are by an Italian named Bernardo bellotto

308
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
He was what's called a venutis

309
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,271
Beanie specialize in the Venetian Art of realistically painting cityscape

310
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,087
And precisely documenting their details

311
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,183
He was invited to Warsaw in the late Seventeen hundreds by the king of Poland

312
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
To become court painter and make pictures of

313
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
The capital

314
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,839
Help his work below to use a camera obscura

315
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
The predecessor of the photographic

316
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,935
And he had an incredible eye for detail

317
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:37,823
So the 20-plus paintings he created what a pretty remarkable document of what Warsaw look like then

318
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
Except for one thing

319
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
The lotto had a tendency to make

320
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Fu

321
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Improve

322
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
And one level

323
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
The paintings were incredibly precise

324
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,087
But on another level below day was

325
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,391
He was very prone to making stuff up

326
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,927
So she didn't sit

327
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,231
Stairway from indulging his autistic lights

328
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
So you have

329
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
In several examples uprichard fight

330
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
The building she was painting

331
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,191
Like adding a story to a building here adding some decoration there

332
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,751
Maybe changing the number of windows in a building

333
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
All sorts of little things

334
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
The met the paintings

335
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
More pleasing to

336
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
The king of Poland loved

337
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,711
And so it turned out later did the Communists

338
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,807
They like the Lopez paintings because they showed a full range of society

339
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
Not just the elite

340
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
They also liked

341
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
His paintings because they were out of the city

342
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
For the Heyday of capitalism

343
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
When Warsaw

344
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
They sought

345
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Still pure

346
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
In fact

347
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,911
There was plenty of other documentation of Warsaw historic section

348
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,959
A group of Architects and students

349
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
Painstaking work

350
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
During the war before the destruction

351
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Creating blueprints

352
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
Taking photographs

353
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,919
And a lot of those blueprints were used in the war song reconstruction

354
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,479
But when it came to rebuilding the Old Town

355
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,295
Balotas paintings became the primary source

356
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Now you can see the evidence

357
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
Busy building codes Young's house

358
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,671
Which is attitude 18 century

359
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
Townhouse

360
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,791
He basically said these kinds of freezes into

361
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Coughing

362
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
Facade

363
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,143
I think the number of floors was changed as well

364
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,191
Some of the roof detailing was changed

365
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,751
If you look at it first if you compare a photograph

366
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
Of this building from

367
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,103
99 NFL draft

368
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,663
Publix today and the painting

369
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,479
You can see that basically the stuff that bill to

370
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
I did to the building

371
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
Because it's now in reality

372
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
So he's such a

373
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
Two flights of fantasy

374
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,695
Materialized in in the weight of the building look soft

375
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,279
The city's historic Warsaw buildings like John's house

376
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
They never exist

377
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,863
Dead at least not like they do now

378
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,191
In the city continues to recreate itself in the form of these paintings

379
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,775
Recently they finished a huge remodeling of the royal roots

380
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,335
Winding sidewalks renovating a church

381
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,663
Sade looks exactly like it doesn't below toes painting

382
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,479
But never like they actually looked before

383
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,807
It's like making an imaginary City come to life

384
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
In the end Warsaw has at Old Town

385
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,463
Groups of children on School field trip strip dutifully through it

386
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,535
Taurus conspicuously absent for the rest of the

387
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
The city block there

388
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
And varsovians themselves

389
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
Largely avoided

390
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,519
It's a place for your kind of begrudgingly obligated to bring out-of-town visitors

391
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:21,919
You are Fisherman's Wharf your Navy Pier I'm sure you know and hate the one in your town

392
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,967
Sunday or holiday with your family

393
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,527
But you don't think of it as the real Warsaw

394
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
I feels more like Disney Zapped

395
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:33,439
There's a certain young hipster contingent in Warsaw

396
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
The troubles instead and

397
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,767
Ugliest parts of the city

398
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
Failed communist experiment

399
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,143
They scoff at the old town because it's so fake

400
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
Such tourist trash

401
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,239
But moroski says they're wrong

402
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,543
It's the old town that really represents

403
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
What the city and the nation itself

404
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
Has been through

405
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
It's equal parts truth

406
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Then falsehood

407
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
Ideology in art

408
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
It's trauma

409
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
And the anti D recovery

410
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
It comes after

411
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,615
99% invisible was written and produced this week by Amy dress.

412
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,711
And Dave McGuire with help from Sam Greenspan and me Roman Mars

413
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:33,087
It's a project to 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco

414
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,903
In the American Institute of Architects in San Francisco

415
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,535
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

416
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,119
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

417
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
If

418
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

419
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,431
All hearing that voice technology talk to us

420
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,479
It is a creation of Sonic trash

421
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,551
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

422
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,135
Studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

423
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,183
To make them more human

424
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
Turn the living room lights on

425
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Okay

426
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,375
Dim the living room lights to 50%

427
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
Okay

428
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:25,567
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

429
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,639
Makes for a much more natural experience

430
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
Turn the living room lights on

431
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,783
Dim the living room lights to 50%

432

460
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,392
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

Might cost you your life

464
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:59,168
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

466

Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

467
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:12,224
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

468
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,624
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of thing if you

469
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,256
Days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop
