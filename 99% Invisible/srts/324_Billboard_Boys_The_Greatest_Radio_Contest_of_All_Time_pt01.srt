I'm Roman Mars

36
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,120
The year was 1982

37
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,168
Turn on the Eastern edge of Pennsylvania

38
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
Small city of Allentown

39
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,800
7 a.m. radio station called wsan

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,896
4 years in broadcast country music to the surrounding Lehigh Valley

41
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,200
An area known for malls Manufacturing

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
And Mack Trucks

43
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,808
But the station was about to undergo a complete identity change

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
Was

45
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Coming off being a country

46
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
Station

47
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
And becoming a nostalgic

48
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
This is Ned Teeter

49
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,048
He was a DJ at wsa in at the time

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,424
He says that as the station transition to Nostalgia mini big band soft hits from the 50s

51
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
They wanted a gimmick to hook new listeners

52
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,848
Something to lure people to the sweet sounds of The Andrews Sisters and Perry Como

53
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
So

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,224
You had FM radio stations play music with really nice fidelity

55
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
You had us play music so

56
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,344
You had to be a little bit

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
Different

58
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
So

59
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
You know they're shutting up and playing the hits

60
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
Or injecting something different

61
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,048
Indoor ER sound in this contest well

62
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
That was a little different

63
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Picanto

64
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,216
Wsan decided it would launch a good old-fashioned endurance contest

65
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,800
Reminiscent of the pole-sitting stunts and dance Marathon

66
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
Popular in the 1920s

67
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,152
Precision security local sponsor Called Love homes

68
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Austin donate a prize

69
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:05,088
Single wide modular home with $18,000

70
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
$18,000 is

71
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
And then they devised the scheme

72
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:15,328
Wsan had a billboard in Lehigh Valley Advertising the new Nostalgia music format

73
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
If you get three contestants

74
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,936
Do I send a 30 ft ladder to the billboard platform

75
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,800
Weber State on that platform the longest would walk away with the new home

76
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:31,456
Wsan called it that you'll love to live with us contest

77
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,856
Air1 radio station wsan challenge their Lehigh Valley listeners to see who could stay the longest

78
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
30 feet of Bubba Highway intersects

79
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,768
It was supposed to be a way to get people to know we've changed our format

80
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,096
Look at our billboard

81
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
That's what this was supposed

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
About what

83
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,312
Wsan have grossly underestimated just how much people would endure

84
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,360
For a little Economic Security

85
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
I don't know if it is

86
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
Is this law of attraction or what but

87
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,552
I mean for the in the weeks leading up to the

88
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
Contest

89
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,672
People are asking me all you're out of the army been away what you going to do I said

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
Going to be in this contest

91
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
This is before they even threw my name

92
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
This is Dalton Young

93
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,143
One of the three contestants that would have been truly be chosen by wsan

94
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
He was 22 years old at the time

95
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,751
He just been discharged from the Army and the month before

96
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
He thought that sitting on the billboard above a highway it sounded like as good an option as any

97
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Not good at that

98
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Unemployment

99
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:41,087
Outrageous Dalton was so dead set on competing that he turned in a thousand entries

100
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,487
He carefully read the submission rules and realize that there was no specified limit to the number of times a person could submit

101
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,071
And it turned out he wasn't the only one who read the fine print

102
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
And have a lot of time on their hands

103
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
Here's one Kistler with his wife Sue

104
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,519
Amazon employee and heard about the pill work on test stand

105
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,847
Wasn't working

106
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Something to do

107
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,551
Ron's not the chattiest person in the world

108
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,135
But what he lacked in conversation he made up for with determination

109
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
We heard about the contest

110
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,255
Gansu and deliver over 4000 entries

111
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Directly

112
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,559
The wsan station

113
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,887
I know you were trying for 4,000

114
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,191
4004 so that's what we send in

115
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,263
Ron and Sue have been dating for a year before the contest

116
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
And they were looking to move in together

117
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
This seemed like the

118
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Perfect opportunity

119
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
Get a place of Their Own

120
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
And I thought was a

121
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
Quick and easy way to get a house

122
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,039
The last of the contestant was Mike McKay

123
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
He died in 2006

124
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,879
Back in the early 1980s

125
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,951
He was the only one of the three contestants who was married

126
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
He was the only one who had a job

127
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
But even still

128
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
He couldn't afford to buy a home

129
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
Make a sentence in astronomic

130
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,215
47000 entries to WFAN

131
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
He use a rubber stamp with the phrase

132
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
I need a home

133
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,847
And then cut out and signed every piece of paper

134
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
Is submitted so many times

135
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
The first 10 entries

136
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
Pulled by the selection team

137
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
We're his

138
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,039
Yeah my first impression of Mike was that he

139
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,391
Full of Bluster

140
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
Again Dalton Young

141
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:25,023
You know if you could get past all the Bluster got a big heart and I

142
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
He's a really nice guy

143
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
Between the three of them

144
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,423
Dalton Ron and Mike submitted 52,004 entries

145
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,727
And this sounds like a lot until you consider it to

146
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
How many total entries there were

147
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,103
The station receive over half-a-million submissions

148
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
We had

149
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,455
Miracle on 34th Street right these bags of postcard

150
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
Hertz on the conference table

151
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Spotify

152
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,575
There was a reason they were getting so many entries

153
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
Around the time the competition launched

154
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,487
The country was slogging through the worst recession it had seen in over 40 years

155
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Good evening

156
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,375
I'm speaking to you tonight to give you a report on the state of our nation's economy

157
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
I regret to say

158
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,471
But we're in the worst economic mess

159
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Since the Great Depression

160
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,639
The recession began in 1980 when the FED raised interest rates to try to fight Rising inflation

161
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,967
Pendragon all the way through 1982

162
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
Companies cut their spending to try to cope

163
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,599
And hundreds of Steel facilities and manufacturing plants closed

164
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,647
Including some in the Lehigh Valley

165
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:28,255
Places like Allentown where wsan was located or hit particularly hard

166
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
You got to remember the

167
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,095
Ground Zero the rest

168
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
Blue Collar town

169
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Steelcon

170
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,727
Mack Trucks is threatening to leave Champion spark plugs and closed

171
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,055
The national unemployment rate was the highest since the Great Depression

172
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
Interest rate skyrocketed

173
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
20% in 1982

174
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,991
If you were a blue collar worker and didn't already own a house at this time

175
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
It would be incredibly tough to get one

176
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,207
How many people the idea of spending a little time on a billboard for a chance to win a home must have seemed like a

177
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
Pretty good deal

178
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,303
Before looking for better times better days

179
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
That's a big part of this this is kind of like a Rust Belt Fairy Tail

180
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:11,007
The contest officially started on September 20th 1982

181
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Dalton Young

182
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:16,639
Ron Kessler and Mike McKay ascended the billboard to begin their stay

183
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
Cowering behind them with an advertisement

184
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
Station Reading Unforgettable

185
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,295
1470 wsan

186
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Here's Dalton

187
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,903
It was raining that day I remember was kind of drizzly and

188
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,463
Crappy little bit damp and cold

189
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,351
And I'm in Irish traffic blown by throughout the day planes flying right over head because it was right near the

190
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Lehigh Valley Airport

191
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,959
This was supposed to be about 30 days

192
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
Event

193
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
This is Jean Worley

194
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
Another DJI wsan

195
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
And one of the contest organizer

196
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,407
Officially is Jean world

197
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,247
But almost everybody around here would call me early world

198
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
Theme from 2 in the morning

199
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:01,695
Worley said that besides some local coverage when the guys went up there wasn't that much fanfare around the contest in the beginning

200
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,791
Even though wsan had launched the contest as a kind of promotion

201
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,375
They didn't do the best job of promoting it with other media Outlet

202
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
It was going on

203
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
People just

204
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
Portmanteau

205
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
There was

206
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,079
Mention on the other radio stations that they might have listened to

207
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
Weather articles in the newspaper

208
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
Wasn't anything on the TV news that they watch

209
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,039
Become additions on the billboard were pretty bare-bones

210
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
Each guy had a small tent

211
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Radio

212
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
A landline telephone

213
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
Chemical toilet

214
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
Which is kind of like a tiny porta potty

215
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
It was almost like camping

216
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
Only you were 30 feet in the air

217
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
Surrounded by freeway traffic

218
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Entrap

219
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,191
We made the guys comfortable we didn't torture own

220
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
Everything going on in there

221
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
The billboard platform itself was about 8 ft

222
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
By 48

223
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,383
And it has been divided into three

224
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Cool sections

225
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
My waist high partition

226
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:00,063
The organizers at wsan wanted to contest the last long enough to draw some attention

227
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
But not

228
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Forever

229
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,183
I figured that by discouraging interaction between the contestants

230
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
They might keep the whole thing to a reasonable length

231
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
And we didn't talk

232
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
At all

233
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
I don't know what we said hi to each other

234
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,007
But even if the guys weren't encouraged to interact with each other they still had plenty of people to keep them company

235
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
From a distance

236
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:25,407
The contest requires that the guys have their own support team to deliver food and to handle cleanup

237
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:31,295
Each contestant had a pulley system so they could raise or lower supplies in buckets or entrees

238
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,391
Dalton's friends and family stop by all the time to chat from Below

239
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
Mike had his wife

240
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,743
And Ron's parents made sure he got everything he needed

241
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,047
And got rid of the things he didn't

242
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
Hirsute Cussler

243
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
What his parents did a lot too

244
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
As far as bringing food

245
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
Is that was in charge of

246
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
I'm doing that

247
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
The Purge on

248
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
How is his job

249
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:58,687
Sue and Ron were dating at the time and suva's did Ron every day except one when he was up on the billboard

250
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Strangely enough

251
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
The contest might have even made the relationship stronger

252
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
Well that's all we can do is talk so

253
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
We got to know each other

254
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
A lot better

255
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
In that time cuz

256
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
We talked everyday and

257
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
On the phone or with me

258
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
At the bottom of the billboard

259
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,911
Aside from the essentials each contestant was allowed to bring a non-essential item with them

260
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,727
Mike McKay brought a guitar which he learn to play up there

261
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,055
Ron Kessler brought a copy of American Rifleman magazine

262
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Hampton

263
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,151
Yeah I had some nunchucks up there in fact I think I got them

264
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
As a

265
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
Deferred my birthday maybe it was

266
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,039
As you can imagine there was little room to do anything

267
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
And even less when Dalton has nunchucks out

268
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
But there wasn't much

269
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Duke.

270
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
Do drawing Kistler on his daily schedule

271
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,047
Yeah I wake up I was having for breakfast

272
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
What's the radio Hangout

273
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
Have something for supper

274
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
What's traffic

275
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
The routine was mind-numbing

276
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
Days quietly crept by

277
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
Benmont

278
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,895
September wake up have something for breakfast

279
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
Tuber what's traffic

280
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
November is the radio

281
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,807
But if they were listening to the radio in November

282
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
They might have heard a new song

283
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:15,231
One that would help transform their sleepy lives up on the billboard into something much bigger and stranger

284
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,047
The song was by Billy Joel

285
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
Weather

286
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:29,311
In November of 1982

287
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
The song Allentown

288
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
Started climbing the Billboard charts

289
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,479
And it happened to be about the very town where wsan was located

290
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:43,135
The song painted a vivid portrait of the economic hardship working-class families were going through at the time

291
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,975
He was talking about companies like Bethlehem Steel in the Lehigh Valley

292
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,303
Shutting its doors in eliminating nearly 10000 jobs

293
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
Because of the song

294
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:57,983
The city of Allentown became a kind of stand-in for all the suffering rustbelt towns in the Northeast and Midwest

295
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Here's Dalton young again

296
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,359
Yeah I think he was talking about the economy and it just happened at this contest

297
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
What's going on at 8

298
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
You know I wasn't

299
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,967
Stated that the office is this

300
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,271
This contest is because the economy so bad

301
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,855
Yeah we're going to try to get somebody at home that might not otherwise have one but

302
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
Yeah they both

303
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
Seem to work together really well

304
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,487
People started paying attention to Allentown

305
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
And the conda

306
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,679
81 days on the billboard for Mike McCabe

307
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:35,871
And as this media coverage expanded stories about the contest started to hit National newspapers

308
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
December 9th 1982

309
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
An article appeared in the Wall Street Journal

310
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
And the response

311
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,575
Was immediate the phones were ringing

312
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,903
Constantly all the line here's Jean early world

313
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,743
Wsan DJ and I have no idea what they're saying except

314
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,071
They're talking about people on a billboard some other time we can

315
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Off

316
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
The air

317
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,679
Some information was gathered that said

318
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,751
The Wall Street Journal did a front-page article

319
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,383
Suddenly this little AM radio station which only had about a 50 mile range

320
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
Was peking a lot of interest

321
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,527
Allentown Pennsylvania has been receiving International publicity

322
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,575
No kidding from all over the world

323
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,647
M&L before social media

324
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,743
Really even before the internet some stories just did that

325
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
And you

326
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
You didn't even really know

327
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
How

328
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,935
This is Betty Morris the staff reporter at the Wall Street Journal who wrote that article

329
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
Where's didn't expect the story to catch on like a dead

330
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,823
Because of her story Dalton Ron and Mike

331
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,223
We're Fielding questions from People magazine Rolling Stone and Phil Donahue about their Extended Stay on the

332
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,807
Don't even remember getting calls from Japan New Zealand

333
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,623
France the landlines that they had up on the board

334
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
The French magazine

335
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
Rihanna story

336
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
In France about

337
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,999
The contest in

338
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
For whatever reason they put

339
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Each of our phone numbers

340
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
So all the sudden

341
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
We're getting like

342
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
150 calls a day from

343
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
French people

344
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
You

345
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,127
Have no idea when you're writing stories which ones are

346
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Are going to

347
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Hit a nerve

348
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,735
I mean it was interesting to look back and see

349
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
All those

350
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,087
All that Paparazzi outside the billboard later

351
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,695
But looking back Betsy Morris understood why this particular story resonated

352
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,279
Then President Ronald Reagan had referred to America as

353
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,327
Shining City upon a hill

354
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
But life was so hard in that shining City that

355
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,983
Three men that can find themselves to a billboard for months

356
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,031
All for a chance to win a home

357
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
There was something dystopian

358
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
About it

359
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,919
I mean the American dream was really shaky at the

360
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,783
Name all the guys in the billboard never said they felt excluded by the radio station

361
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,343
An air of desperation did begin to

362
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,159
Seep into the contact as the months went by

363
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
How long do you think you'll be here

364
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
Call Maybe

365
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
I don't know

366
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,351
Depending on that mostly try to run that by me again

367
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
Probably 2 years

368
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
Mini you're 9 months

369
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,983
I'm down for summer of 84

370
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
Some summer person

371
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,591
They asked us how long we would stay up there and I said

372
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
Two or three years

373
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,687
Then I really mad at you and I was I was just

374
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
That wasn't just bravado but I figured okay

375
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,063
In order to save enough to get an $18,000 home

376
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,111
What would I be willing to invest

377
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
Time

378
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Two to three years

379
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,767
When December and January arrived it started getting colder

380
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,095
Lowest recorded temperature was 0 degrees Fahrenheit

381
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
So the guys were getting portable heaters

382
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Keep them from

383
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Dying

384
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,519
Huge snowstorm shut down the entire city

385
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,055
They didn't stop the contest

386
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
According to Dalton

387
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
It was a welcome

388
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Change of pace

389
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,479
You know for me I was a piece of cake enough for that whatever 24 hours or

390
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,295
However long 48 hours till I dug everything out it was

391
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
It was peaceful

392
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,879
You know it was just so quiet and so peaceful

393
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
What was great

394
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
Actually given everything the guys were going through

395
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
The isolation

396
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
The weather at the border

397
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,303
They were holding up surprisingly well

398
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
Here's an interview with Ron around the same time

399
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,703
The temperature has dropped to zero emotional 24in

400
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,079
You must be talking to yourself but I know how you doing psychologic

401
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,127
Oh I'm fine

402
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Get out

403
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,991
Don't run and sting happening

404
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
Something

405
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Happen

406
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,183
Was one morning there's a guy out talking to Ron and Mike stranger that Dalton hasn't seen before was down below the billboard

407
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
Chatting with the guys

408
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,559
He casually struck up a conversation with Dalton telling him that he was also a veteran

409
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:43,423
We were talking about our experiences in the military and some of the party and we had it done at 9

410
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,239
He asked me if I got high

411
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,079
Yeah I thought of that point of some sort of a bond you know

412
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Aishwarya Rai

413
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,919
I mean he was on a billboard for 6 months

414
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
Ask me if I could get him some and ice

415
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
Tomorrow I got a little like

416
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Departwest

417
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,855
Play stuck in a cigarette pack and drop it

418
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,415
Dalton Lord down to join

419
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,231
And the stranger thing to him with a $20 bill

420
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
I said look man

421
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,607
You don't know I exist I exist I thought why don't you know

422
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,167
Twenty bucks twenty bucks I'm not going to turn it down you know

423
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,471
Get a phone call early in the morning and probably be

424
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
Before 5

425
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
This is my Christ

426
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,823
Executive director of the hgf

427
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
The company that was funding the contras

428
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,199
He remembers getting a call from a contest organizer

429
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:33,599
Zane have a good time telling the boss this while I got busted for drugs Isis what highlights of how can it be selling

430
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
Drugs from urine

431
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
30 feet up on a billboard

432
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,487
Apparently the strangerhood solicited

433
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
The pot from Dalton

434
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
Have been an undercover police officer

435
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,119
Cuz Dalton accepted that $20

436
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,911
He was arrested on drug charges

437
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
It made the front page of the

438
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
The Philadelphia Inquirer at I think

439
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,335
The same day that the Reagan announces missile defense

440
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,663
So marriage Reagan's missile-defense system and theirs

441
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,479
There's adult being busted on the

442
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
Turn on the front page

443
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,599
Dalton was knocked out of the competition on day 184

444
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,159
I'm probably the only person in history to be arrested

445
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
It's on fire

446
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Billboard

447
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,023
And yes there were plenty of rumors that don't have been setup

448
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,375
Maybe one of the other guys were poured into the police or maybe one of the contest sponsor is

449
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
Speed along the end of the canto

450
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
None of this was actually

451
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Proven

452
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Got it

453
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
It's really really

454
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Fishing

455
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,663
Run Mike both descended from the billboard to testify in court

456
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Add breakfast

457
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
Quick shower

458
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,783
And then went right back up on the billboard to finish out the contest

459
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
Rodger Dalton's arrest

460
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
Competition felt

461
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
Different

462
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Here's Ned Teeter again

463
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
On the wsan DJs

464
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
We have this contest

465
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
And

466
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
These people be coming

467
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
Every man hero

468
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,167
It's a great story

469
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
It's heartwarming

470
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,287
And then over two joints of marijuana Dalton get

471
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Hold off

472
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
I think that's one thing

473
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,199
I think that's when things went from

474
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,247
How is this thing going to end

475
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,783
2

476
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,927
By this point the competition has become a huge annoyance for Town officials

477
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,511
The town commissioner even describe the contest as a hemorrhoid

478
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
And wanted it stopped

479
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,375
Officials here at Town Hall equally disillusion with a contest

480
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,703
I've contemplated sending the housing inspector to evicted contestant

481
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,007
The billboard has no Plumbing or smoke alarm

482
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,079
And the town's already sent them bills for residency

483
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
Teatox listening to billboard

484
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,711
The Ron Kessler and Mike McKay had dug their heels in deep

485
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,039
Neither would come down unless they were coming down to a new home

486
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,111
Decision that received more publicity than it ever needed

487
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,415
At this point is it become a burden

488
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,231
Wsan had the attention of the world

489
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,767
But nothing to say

490
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
We were radio

491
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,167
Marketing maven

492
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,751
Ron and Mike lasted 2 months Beyond Dalton's drug bust

493
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,287
Before wsan cave

494
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,591
And realize that enough was enough

495
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:07,711
When it became obvious neither man would quit and both threatened to stay forever if necessary

496
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,015
The station declared the contest a draw

497
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,343
And lured them in down by offering duplicate prices for each

498
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:19,232
They had captured the attention of the region when they came down today

499
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,144
On June 7th 1983 Ron and Mike both step down off their respective ladders at the same time

500
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:31,776
They've been up on the billboard for 261 days nearly nine months

501
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,104
When an entire time they had taken only one shower

502
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,384
I'm really happy with the fans

503
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,712
The station had received some criticism around the contest

504
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,016
People that accuse them of exploiting the guys

505
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:47,904
So wsan actually up the prizes to try to repair some of the Damage Done their reputation

506
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,952
Ron and Mike both walked away

507
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
With a modular home

508
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
Chevy Chevette

509
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,536
Ana free vacation

510
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,096
This wasn't supposed to be this

511
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,680
It wasn't supposed to be the big International global

512
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
Almost year-long thing

513
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:05,568
The men reacted very differently and their post contest lines

514
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,152
Mike tried to recreate the fame he had when he was up on the board

515
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,688
That never really happen

516
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,992
But when he died in 2006

517
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,576
Is obituary still referred to him by his preferred nickname

518
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
Billboard Mike

519
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,416
He was the guy that you would say

520
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,744
This was my high water mark this to find me

521
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
I think that

522
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,096
That Mike McKay was the one that loved at the most

523
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,888
Steel of being billboard mic

524
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,936
At least he made off better than.

525
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,984
I got 6 months probation in it

526
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
And $100

527
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
Course I do if I fell

528
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
Ron Kessler

529
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
Quiet determination the other hand

530
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,736
Probably gotten the closest to that rustbelt fairytale ending

531
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,064
Cansu married shortly after the contest end date

532
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,648
They lived happily in their two bedroom modular home for 20 years

533
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
Raise the daughter in it

534
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
I moved on with their lives

535
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,024
At the end of the day you've got

536
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
Three guys that

537
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
Did something crazy

538
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,912
Try and just get a little bit ahead of the

539
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,008
I mean remember these guys weren't looking for a mansion or a Jet Plane

540
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
We're just looking for a start

541
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,160
A very special thanks

542
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:30,560
Pat Taggart and Frank petka episode was adapted from their fantastic feature-length documentary billboard boy

543
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,632
What's available right now on Amazon and iTunes

544
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,496
What happens when you take away all the Billboards

545
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,544
They did it in the city in Brazil

546
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
We'll talk about that

547
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
After that

548
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:52,832
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

549
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,392
Cluttered world of man-made sound

550
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,024
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

551
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,840
Just talking to me and my wife is in another room and

552
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,704
Voice technology talk to us

553
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,008
It is a creation of Sonic trash

554
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,824
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

555
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,408
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

556
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,456
To make them more human

557
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,552
Turn the living room lights on

558
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
Okay

559
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880
Dim the living room lights

560
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
50%

561
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
Okay

562
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:36,096
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

563
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,912
Makes for a much more natural experience

564
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
Turn the living room lights on

565
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,544
Dim the living room lights to 50

566
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
2%

567
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:52,480
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

568
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,016
About how are sounds gay

569
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,552
Is impacting our health

570
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,856
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

571
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,928
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

572
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
Right here

573
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
NPR

574
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,072
We need to talk about

575
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,888
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

576
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:16,032
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time

577
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Frustrating

578
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:21,920
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

579
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,200
And you don't know why

580
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
But it may be time to seek out

581
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,576
Go to oh my God. Info podcast

Oh my God

585
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Dot and Bo

586
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:44,192
In Allentown a single billboard became a much bigger sign of the times

587
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:50,080
What started as a simple radio promotion ended up shedding light on a larger economic and housing crisis

588
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
Decades later

589
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,432
Something similar would happen in Sao Paulo Brazil

590
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,736
But this time it was about the removal

591
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
A billboard

592
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Words that reveal

593
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,296
A bigger story

594
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
Percocet is here to talk about

595
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,648
So in the early 2000s

596
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
Littered with

597
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,512
That's including around 15000

598
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
Billboards

599
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,120
It is this visual pollution got worse people became

600
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
Increasingly frustrated you know it

601
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
Private companies be allowed

602
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,984
Basically brand Publix

603
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
Space

604
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,312
The bear comes along and proposes a

605
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Clean city law

606
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
To get rid of

607
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
All kinds of

608
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
Business Signs posters

609
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
It all had to go

610
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,040
Even handing out marketing Flyers industry

611
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Illegal

612
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
So extreme

613
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,928
Businesses must not have been happy about that at all

614
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:41,536
Yeah they really weren't I mean this was a city full of ads and suddenly

615
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,352
But this proposed law have a ton of Publix

616
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Support

617
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
And predictably Business Leaders fought

618
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:52,800
Corporate lobbyists are you better be bad for the economy would compromise

619
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:58,176
They also tried to scare people with the idea that public tax money would be needed to remove all this

620
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,760
Supporting infrastructure you know that the poles in the scaffolding

621
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
Around these billboards

622
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:07,136
There is even an argument that Commercial Graphics were useful as we fighting

623
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,952
Helping people navigate the city

624
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,304
Bus at night you were lit up signs would make us any less safe

625
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
And so on

626
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,656
So I guess some of those arguments make some sound

627
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
But

628
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,472
They all seem to be rooted primarily

629
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Absolutely

630
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
Timothy end

631
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
Business Advocates loss

632
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,968
The law passed in businesses were given 90 days to comply or to start paying fines

633
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,808
Until the ad started coming down and suddenly the city did looked at

634
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,880
Enter some old architecture was uncovered

635
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,696
Pulling down All Those ads

636
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
Also revealed some

637
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
Other hidden tasks

638
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
What kind of things

639
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,400
Stripping away huge billboard alongside major roads

640
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
Sprint students ended up

641
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,032
Entire Shantytown neighborhoods that have been visually fence

642
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Lights off

643
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Bayat

644
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:02,432
And then I'm beside the factories where they were these Billboards covering up Windows

645
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,504
Removing them actually revealed immigrants living where they were

646
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,576
Essentially they weren't being paid enough to afford

647
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:13,696
And the absence of ads in general right like sort of the decolorization of the city

648
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,256
Put a lot of focus on crumbling

649
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,048
Fracture ICD-10

650
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
The spotlight

651
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,656
So what about all those concerns from Business Leaders about

652
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:29,312
People not be able to wayfinder into dark at night

653
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:34,688
And it turns out that yes people can still find a way around cities without ads

654
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,016
And a lot of building owners ended up repeating their facade

655
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
So

656
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,600
A lot of structures ended up looking better and worse think of any

657
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,160
So this all started like a decade ago

658
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
Is Sao Paulo still

659
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
Totally add free today

660
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
Samantha Baxley been allowed back out

661
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
But it's

662
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,072
How much more controlled than

663
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
There's this

664
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,912
New awareness about how things look

665
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,520
Super example there these interactive search engine ads at bus shelter

666
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,592
But let Riders look up the weather where they're going

667
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
And

668
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,712
Part of the deal is that marketers have to actually take care of those bus shelter

669
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,808
So kind of like that. The highway program you put a little ADD

670
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
As long as you provide

671
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:17,696
Something good for the community

672
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
Technology twist

673
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,584
And I was actually just reading about something else that the current mayor proposed last year

674
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,376
His ideas to reintroduce

675
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,912
Exactly 32 billboard

676
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,008
Each one for one of the 32 main bridges that run around the city

677
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:35,104
Any idea there is that marketers can advertise on these only if they agree to

678
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
Tua maintain that bridge

679
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,432
Peach cobbler

680
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,480
Like the bus shelters they have to use

681
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,528
Some of the visual displays based

682
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
Actually show useful

683
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
Like traffic updates

684
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
The time in the

685
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Very cool

686
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,696
See how I said he goes about

687
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,512
Selectively reintroducing advertising once they start with a

688
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
The Clean Slate

689
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
Yeah it's something that you know most cities

690
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:59,680
Just aren't like they just never ever ever get a chance

691
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,032
And tell you when you do you want to be deliberate and you want to make sure

692
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:07,616
For the public good it's a really great experiment a set of watch unfold

693
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:12,224
We have some pictures of these in the website oh yeah

A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

712
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,832
The body genius is a dark

713
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Comic mystery

714
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
That whines through a

715
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904

00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,256
Might cost you your life

719
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:05,632
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

720
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,984
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

721
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,312
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

722
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
A dad

723
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,688
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

724
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,992
Actually if I'm being honest

725
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that guy

726
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,464
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

727
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,792
Was found dead in my private gym

728
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,120
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,400
Even worse

730
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,472
The cops think that I had something to do with it

731
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
Now

732
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,800
I need to clear my name

733
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,336
Somebody out there

734
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:51,200
Killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

735
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,112
