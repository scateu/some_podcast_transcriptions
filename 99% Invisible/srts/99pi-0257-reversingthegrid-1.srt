I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
In the late 1800s as more and more people began to have electric lights in their homes utility

26
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:21,152
Companies began looking for a good way to measure how much electricity each customer was using

27
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,712
Actually way back when Thomas Edison built

28
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
The first electric power stations

29
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,552
There were no electric meters in people

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,904
So he build a monthly fee based on how many lightbulbs they have

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
Sam evans-brown

32
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,976
New Hampshire Public Radio

33
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,536
That billing / light bulb system

34
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,376
Wasn't great so people came up with a meter that did the job well enough

35
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,704
It's the same basic meter that most of us in the US have in our home

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Holmes today

37
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:51,872
And the way it works is when the electricity comes into your house a little dial turns forward and shows how much you've used

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:56,224
And even though the original designers in never really intended for this to happen

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,528
If you send electricity back into the grid

40
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,064
Dial turns backwards

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,856
Yashow electricity leaving your house

42
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,488
If you like me there's no electricity leaving your house

43
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
It's only coming in

44
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,840
If you're like Sam who has solar panels on his roof

45
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
Electricity is leaving the house

46
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
I'm going back

47
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Into the grid

48
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
Yeah

49
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
That's because my solar panels

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,032
Create more energy than I can use

51
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,824
That excess energy goes back in

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
The grid and

53
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
Out to my neighbors

54
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
In my state New Hampshire

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,736
I get credited for that extra energy I create

56
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
It's practice called netty

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Metering

58
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,600
And for a while it was totally

59
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
Not controversial

60
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
But now it is

61
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,232
There are huge political battle

62
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
Being fought over this

63
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,912
Sam his colleagues at New Hampshire Public Radio actually did a whole episode of their podcast outside in about net mean

64
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Because

65
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,240
They are even earlier than we are

66
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
And I'm actually just going to hand it off to them now

67
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,616
So here's Sam in a little bit you'll hear the voices of his colleague

68
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
Maureen McMurray

69
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
Ann Taylor Quimby

70
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,064
So before we get into the controversy over net metering

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,672
I want to go back and introduce you to the guy who accidentally started it all

72
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
His name

73
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
Steven Strong

74
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
Sun energy lights

75
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
Despite

76
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
Appropriately

77
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
Anime cat plugin

78
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
To like me

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,192
Steven is in energy nerd

80
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,288
He's a guy who went Toyota came out with a Prius he got his engineers

81
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
Hack the thing

82
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,664
What are sub gives driver looking at here

83
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Battery pack

84
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,248
The shoehorned into the spare tire

85
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,808
So he and his engineers

86
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
Made a plug-in Prius

87
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
Hundred years before the car company

88
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,720
And also Toyota WinCo Nana's when we told him we were doing this

89
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
The way back before he started messing around with Priuses

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,888
Steven founded the company called solar Design Associates

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
This was at a time when solar power

92
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,264
Besides being something on satellites in outer space

93
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
Wasn't really

94
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Vignette

95
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,128
When was this again is the 70s

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,248
It was a heck of a hard way to make an easy living in the 70s and the 80s and the 90s

97
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,040
So Steven Strong is this

98
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,904
Hard-charging ready to drop everything and get his hands dirty kind of guy

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
And he kicked off would eventually became

100
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,768
Kind of a revolution in the way a lot of

101
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
People are getting their energy

102
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
He did it by putting solar panels

103
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
On an apartment building

104
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
For people with modest income

105
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
Barely acceptable

106
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:29,311
Oh wow it's huge

107
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:34,175
Pretty wife looks kind of like a big college dorm

108
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
It's brick

109
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
And pretty unremarkable

110
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
Supposed to drive this way

111
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
Well

112
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855
That's The Story of My Life

113
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Boone was built

114
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,207
How much proof that was this massive array of solar panels

115
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
When the first-of-its-kind

116
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,303
This was one of the largest

117
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
Source for most systems in New England

118
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Candid

119
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,447
Met something like 80% of the annual hot water required

120
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:03,103
But this was this was like the early days of sources is solar thermal is just like heating hot water didn't make electricity solar

121
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Thermal

122
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,967
All uses solar panels but all it does is heat up hot water

123
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
And

124
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
That was

125
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,319
It was cool like the simplest technology

126
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
It's so simple

127
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Big Boss

128
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
And on the inside you got some tubes

129
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
That are colored black

130
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,279
And you put water in it or some sort of coolant refrigerant in there

131
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
And The Sun Shines on the black tubes

132
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:28,959
And heat it up and then you can circulate that back into a tank and that's all it was as I feel like I could come

133
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:33,567
I think that's that's like on the level technology-wise of like using a magnifying glass

134
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
Digital access

135
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
Pizza Patron

136
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Wait

137
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,943
The solar panels at Carter put on the White House

138
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
Where does the solar thermal once

139
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,807
Stupid water at the White House

140
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Yeah

141
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,135
In any case it was mostly

142
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
Solar thermal panels

143
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,999
Steven Strong convinced the developer to let him install a couple

144
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,815
A solar photovoltaic panels to

145
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,399
Photovoltaic panels are the ones that actually make electricity

146
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,703
And that time they were brand-new technology

147
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,543
Not as soon as the technology was available we were employing it

148
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
But there was this question

149
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
How should I do the wiring

150
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
Wait what do you mean so whenever the sun is shining obviously the electricity will go towards running all the stuff in the bill

151
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,903
Building you know water pumps hot water heaters whatever

152
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
Or what happens if

153
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,487
The sun is shining and there's nothing going on in the building

154
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
So what are you decided to do

155
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
We should configure

156
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,911
No son the building would work just like any other building

157
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,471
It would buy electricity from utility company

158
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,543
I'm a little dials on the electric meter would roll forward

159
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
5 kilowatt hours

160
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
10 kilowatt hours

161
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
20 30 40 50

162
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
I don't I don't know what a watt

163
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,111
Money

164
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
He don't have to know what I want

165
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
What a kilowatt hour is

166
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,047
You don't have to know all you need to know is that it's the measurement for electricity

167
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
Just getting back to Steven solar panels

168
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,167
What he did that no one had ever done before was too wired up

169
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
So that it's

170
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
The Sun

171
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
Was shining

172
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,543
In the building wasn't using any energy

173
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,127
The unused electricity would flow out into the grid

174
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
A little dial on the meter which is

175
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,223
Roll in the other direction

176
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Backwards

177
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
50

178
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
40

179
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
30

180
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
20

181
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
10

182
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:28,767
At the end of the month when a person comes to check the meter the owners of the building would pay for whatever the dial set

183
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,863
So like if they use 60 kilowatt-hours but they put in 40

184
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
The guy with a 20

185
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
And it would only pay

186
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Who was just

187
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
It was intuitive it was almost like

188
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
That's just the way it should be

189
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:48,223
Looks like we're producing electrons that are just as valuable as the ones provided by the coal plant or the heavy residual

190
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
Fuel oil drum

191
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Implant

192
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
Why shouldn't they

193
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
Receive the same value

194
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,671
And enjoyed it just made sense

195
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,791
Did you talk to the utility at all what did you show them your design and say this is what we're going to do

196
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
No

197
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,119
The Developers

198
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,727
You should don't you don't worry about that you just got the technical side of this done and

199
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
And get it get it working

200
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
And we'll take care of it

201
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
We're going to be interfacing with utility

202
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
I turned out that

203
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,711
Did they didn't say anything about the system to the utility purposefully

204
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
I am

205
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
And told me if

206
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
The time

207
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,135
There's one thing in your career that you should learn early in that is it's easier to ask for

208
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
Forgiveness than it is to ask permission

209
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
And that

210
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
Ladies and gentlemen is how we got a little policy

211
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
Call Net metering

212
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
It's electric so why wouldn't he tell them

213
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Well

214
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
Uncharted waters

215
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
I would say

216
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
He don't want to be told no

217
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
The net metering

218
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
It's the net of

219
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,783
When a meter goes forward and goes backwards

220
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
What's in between

221
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,599
Yeah net as in net

222
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Versus gross

223
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
I mean the only reason it was designed that way

224
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,255
Is because that is what the meteor could do you know that little

225
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Spinning disc

226
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,095
Electric meter all I can do is Bend forward and backwards

227
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
That's what I use

228
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,167
But it was well and truly the first one

229
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,239
That was connected to the utility grid

230
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
Outside the fence

231
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
The government Laboratory

232
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,407
Okay so puts in the solar panels on the roof of this building what would happens

233
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,247
So the utility company they were actually fine with the whole thing in fact

234
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,551
They praised Stevens innovation

235
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
But the solar panels didn't last very long

236
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
Baxley blue off the building in the first year

237
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
I didn't like

238
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
Kumon or whatever

239
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,791
Is it gets windy

240
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
So not a terribly auspicious start

241
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,959
What it did was kick off some intense interest in this idea

242
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:50,079
That solar could serve the needs of a home but also produce electricity for the grid like a tiny

243
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
Part-time power plant

244
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:57,759
And this concept of homeowner as power plants is actually important in thinking about how people with solar panels

245
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
On their homes will be

246
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Hade

247
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
For the power they're producing

248
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:05,695
Because big established power plant sell power to the utility companies

249
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,999
At a cheaper wholesale cost

250
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,047
And then the utility companies can

251
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
Sell their customers at powered higher

252
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
Retail row

253
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
So they can make

254
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Profit and

255
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Pay for their cause

256
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
Send the question becomes

257
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
Do people with solar panels

258
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,895
They become like the mini power plant should they be paid the lower wholesale rate or the higher

259
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Retail row

260
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,991
Are they like Costco or are they like mom-and-pop

261
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
Is that what is that it

262
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
Elegy

263
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
I think that's pretty good

264
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
In any case

265
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
States eventually started passing laws about

266
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
Dairy question

267
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
And that was all through the 80s and the 90s

268
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,655
And for the most part these laws that the utility company should pay people

269
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
The higher

270
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,215
Retail rate because

271
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
Inexpensive solar panels

272
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
Your house and this would incentivize solar

273
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
And eventually

274
00:10:54,591 --> 00:11:00,223
41 States passed laws allowing people to get the tire retail rate for net metering and utility companies

275
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
Have the time

276
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,039
They didn't put up much of a fight about it

277
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,903
Jibbitz utility companies at this point they're like dancing with the devil and they don't even realize it

278
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,231
Yeah and nobody nobody had any reason to say

279
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,047
Oh this might not be a good idea because solar was just like this

280
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
Weird thing

281
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
Probably would never going to be cost of a

282
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,959
And that's how it was for a bunch of years

283
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
Until

284
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Suddenly

285
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Solar star

286
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Where to get cheap

287
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:32,735
For decades or power was so expensive and unwieldy if you can afford it

288
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,831
And that is changing in a mind-bendingly rapid pace

289
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,135
Solar related stocks rally.

290
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
Wednesday on the news that Congress planes food

291
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,511
Extend a solar investment tax credit

292
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
During the mid 2000

293
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,399
A bunch of really ambitious Well Finance Company start saying

294
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
Hey we can make some money doing

295
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:57,055
And so from 2009-2010 amount of solar in US doubled

296
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,455
It doubled again from 2010 to 2011 doubled again from 2011 to 2013 and from 20

297
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
2013 to today

298
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
It soundtrack

299
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,039
Triple A game

300
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
Okay so so what is

301
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,903
What are these companies doing that's different like how are they

302
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
Making money what's their motto

303
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
What they're doing

304
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,303
Is there offering people solar for no money down

305
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,631
They pay for the cost of the panels and exchange they take

306
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,447
A chunk of the money that you would earn by producing power

307
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
So if you had someone come and knock on your door and say hey want to be part of the next renewable energy are

308
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:37,247
And you can have solar panels on your roof right now is not going to cost you any money and we're going to give you a discount on your power bill

309
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
That yeah

310
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
And that business model

311
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
Is made possible by net-metering

312
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
By getting this higher retail rate

313
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,975
But our people are producing with solar

314
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
And I think it's fair to say that the utility company

315
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,071
Basically did not see this coming

316
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
And so now

317
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,143
They're starting to push back

318
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
They don't want to be paying the retail rate

319
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,519
They think people generating electricity with solar should get

320
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
The wholesale rate

321
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
Just like a power play

322
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,639
So where where are the fights happening now

323
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,943
Where were the really high-profile fight over

324
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,783
Well so the obviously Arizona is the number one

325
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,367
So that's Christy shallenberger who works for this industry new psychology

326
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
Utility I've attract all the

327
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
She points out that we've seen a net metering battles

328
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
In California

329
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,559
And of course you have Nevada which has basically become

330
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
The byword for what

331
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
You don't want to see

332
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,911
Nevada's fight got really

333
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
Huge huge blow back from

334
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:34,335
All walks of life basically up celebrities your presidential candidates

335
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
I do not often get involved

336
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,223
State or local issues other than my own state

337
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,271
But I find it rather in

338
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
Incredible

339
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
Seattle public utilities

340
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
Commission Nevada

341
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
Has made a decision

342
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
Which makes it hot

343
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
What people

344
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,495
Play who's that Bernie Sanders

345
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,199
Really that's crazy obscure policy that's getting tons of attention

346
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,551
Hillary Clinton talk about it when she went to Nevada and talk to local newspapers there

347
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
They're fighting

348
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,927
Iowa Texas Maine Vermont New York Utah Hawaii

349
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
Of course right here in New Hampshire

350
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
Isabel what's happening

351
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
All over the country

352
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
Dubai state

353
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
The local electric company

354
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,399
Is pushing back and all the solar installers fighting against

355
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Utilities

356
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Local

357
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
Flavor to this argument but I still don't understand a little bit about this fight like why would me having solar panel

358
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
What's on my roof

359
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
Why would it make the utility company like

360
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
So

361
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
Angry is it just money

362
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
Of course it's about money

363
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
With whose money

364
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
Do utility companies want to reframe this argument

365
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Slipknot

366
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
Just about there in

367
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
But it's about the interest

368
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
The people who

369
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Don't have

370
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
Here I talked to Michael herring

371
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Who

372
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191
Cure New Hampshire he used to be one of the guys who regulates

373
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
It's a

374
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
Taking from the not so

375
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,335
People that have not so much and giving his

376
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
People have more

377
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,967
Say I was retired school teacher Manchester living in an apartment is no way I'm going

378
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
Roof

379
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,343
And get any benefit from that meeting but I'm going to have to pay for it

380
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Because

381
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
Some guy in Bedford

382
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
She's bedford's example

383
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
Nothing to do

384
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,791
Bedford if you're not from New Hampshire is a wealthy suburb of Manchester

385
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,863
Which is our biggest city 4000 square foot house

386
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:38,751
And he said if I do this net metering thing in five or six years I'll be getting basically free electricity

387
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,847
It's a reverse distribution of wealth when the way we normally do

388
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
United States

389
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
And I don't think that

390
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Right

391
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
I get it so it's like someone ultimately has to pay and all of these people who are people of means we're homeowners have

392
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,695
Solar panels than the cost of the other utility will go up

393
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,743
And that means that people who are renting

394
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
Or anything like that they get screwed because I want

395
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,839
Solar panels on my house

396
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,399
This is how rate structures work

397
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,191
Write a utility is

398
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
A big

399
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Company that invest

400
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
What's a ton of money in

401
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
Poles and wires

402
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,127
Is in energy to send across those poles and wires

403
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
And then they take

404
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
All of the customer

405
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,271
And they divided the cost of that up between all of them

406
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
Spread it around

407
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
And under that business

408
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:29,183
If they 50% of the people in the US went solar and started at me during

409
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,023
A big chunk of the money that their saving is money that's not going towards

410
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,815
Paying for the poles and wires

411
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
So this is the argument against net metering witches

412
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
You

413
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Or anything

414
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:45,567
USA me because I actually do have solar panels on my roof right because I don't screw and you yeah me putting solar panels on my roof

415
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
Cost you money

416
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
What the hell Sam

417
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Except

418
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
The problem is

419
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
We're not 100% sure

420
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
I got to look something up cuz

421
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,391
This is another former regulator Cliff below

422
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,463
He's the one here in New Hampshire who wrote

423
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,559
The first initial net metering law here in New Hampshire

424
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,863
Even then

425
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,679
There was this intuition like this feeling

426
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
That maybe they were actually benefit

427
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
So the feeling was solar Mike

428
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,103
Higher-than-average in in value

429
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
And I think the evidence is

430
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,967
Is proven that out over the years that solar tends to produce at higher than ever

431
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Average price hours

432
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,807
Toe clip below is literally saying the exact

433
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:32,159
Opposite thing from Michael Harrington he's saying that me 20 solar panels on my roof actually

434
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Saves you guys

435
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,743
Okay but this is a pickle I don't know if I believe

436
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
I don't think I don't think it's going to save enough money

437
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
Alright so

438
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,911
So let's first maybe dig into why it might be

439
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:47,519
Even though we pay the same amount for every unit of energy on our electric bills

440
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
All electrons are not

441
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Created equal

442
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:54,943
In reality every 5 minutes there's a new option for energy so every 5 minutes

443
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
We got a new

444
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
Price for Energy

445
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
When demand is low

446
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
Prices are low and they can actually go negative

447
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
Like power plants

448
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
Us

449
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,207
They don't have to shut down

450
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
Usually that's at night

451
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
And when demand is high prices can be in

452
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,119
Saying like a hundred times higher than normal

453
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,935
And again do utilities take all of those costs

454
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
The average them all out and they divide them by their customer

455
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
The thing is

456
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Solar panel

457
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
Those are producing at times of day that

458
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
Really high value

459
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
Sunny hot

460
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,759
Desert usually times where where electricity is expensive and that's when you're producing solar power

461
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,063
And so by feeding back into the grid

462
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,111
We're cutting usage

463
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
So much that

464
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
That it lowers the price during the

465
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
Exact

466
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,999
And so Cliff below's arguing

467
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
These people are actually

468
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,583
You don't even though they're getting paid

469
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
More than a regular power plant

470
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,191
They're actually getting paid less than the energy

471
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
And that means that there's

472
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
Saving

473
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Things for every solar panel

474
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Can you put on the grid

475
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:58,687
I would read but that's only true up until a certain point right I mean if you suddenly tip it and it's

476
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:03,039
Goes from 20% of the population on solar panel to 5270 then

477
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,343
I'm sorry clip your math doesn't work out

478
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
That is exactly right

479
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,671
You should go work for MIT

480
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,511
People do have ideas about how to solve office

481
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Which we can talk about

482
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,095
Or we could not

483
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,935
The most interesting to me

484
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
Is from a guy

485
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
Call Don Creech

486
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,055
Do you think of the way

487
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
That we pay for electricity

488
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Is it dumb

489
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
Deleting question yes

490
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,759
It is clearly inappropriate

491
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,855
In today's technological age

492
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,719
To continue to charge people the same price for electricity 24/7

493
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,303
When the cost of providing people electricity varies

494
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,911
Sometimes by orders of magnitude depending on the time of day and the time

495
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Year

496
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
And the great condition

497
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Randstad apply

498
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,823
So is it not then by extension also kind of dumb

499
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
To not very the

500
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,895
Price that were paying

501
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,455
Customer toward generating solar power from the roof

502
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
I agree with that as well

503
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
Don is Stacy

504
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,367
Consumer Advocate his job is to watch out

505
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
For people who pay electric bills

506
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
So basically he's supposed

507
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,999
We keeping costs down and looking out

508
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
A little guy

509
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
It simply isn't

510
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
Fair

511
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
To take a you know

512
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,447
Tired school teacher living on a fixed income in

513
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,031
Manchester and force that customer

514
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,847
To pay subsidies to a

515
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,175
Wealthy hedge fund manager living in Bedford

516
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,247
Who has a mcmansion discovered in solar panel

517
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:44,159
Is there is there some actual retired school teacher in Manchester and some actual hedge fund manager in Bedford because my

518
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
Michael Harrington gave me p

519
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,231
Exact same as how could she

520
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,071
At not not that I'm aware of

521
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
There totally is

522
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,167
Where are those

523
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,751
But anyway I mean Don Kris

524
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,799
Also thinks that this cost

525
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
Shifting thing

526
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
Is a problem

527
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
And so this

528
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Is what Don Chris wants

529
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Called

530
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
Time-of-use rate

531
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:14,623
Isn't you get paid more if your solar is going during those high-priced times like later in the afternoon

532
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
But

533
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
You also

534
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,720
Hey more if you're using more energy

535
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
The afternoon

536
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
SO2 make

537
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,840
Is really simple everyday there be a different price

538
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
Higher price

539
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
Between 2 p.m.

540
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
At 8 p.m.

541
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,472
What's the weather like for cities prices

542
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
And this

543
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,408
Is cracking open the door

544
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,456
Tor radically different weight

545
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
To pay for energy

546
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
Instead of abiding by the

547
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,320
Crazy illusion that every electron is worth

548
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
Same amount

549
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,392
Is acknowledging that when demand is high

550
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
Expensive

551
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,720
And maybe we should let people know that

552
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512
I think that we can

553
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,096
Provide that Morad frequently updated information to Consumers

554
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,888
So this is Jessica Transit

555
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,984
She's a professor of energy studies at MIT I think that that should be possible yeah

556
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
But she wants to take it even a step

557
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Farther

558
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,080
Remember there is

559
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,896
Constantly a new price for electricity every 5 minutes

560
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,712
And she thinks we should have a display in our houses

561
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
Is it says

562
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
Here's the price of energy

563
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
Right now

564
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:20,672
Play something literally follows like the 5 minutes every 5 minutes to Market clears you get a new price

565
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:27,072
Well maybe hourly you know I think 5 minutes 5 minutes might be a bit too much but but hourly

566
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,144
So if if you ever find a utility that wants to

567
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,936
To do that I'm I'm ready to sign up

568
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
I'll be in the pilot

569
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
I think I'll be fine

570
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,056
Okay great I'll let you know I'll let

571
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:43,712
Messi I actually find that really interesting because I had no idea that it buried at all and it

572
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:49,088
Varies wildly and you know I don't think twice about turning the light switch on if there was a flashing

573
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,392
Red high price alert or something

574
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Yes right

575
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,976
Now there are some really important caveats

576
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
This pouch

577
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,304
41 rolling out new meters everywhere would be

578
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
Expensive

579
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:04,448
And this would be a very big maybe very difficult change in the way utilities operate

580
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
But for two

581
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
The market

582
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
Can be brutal

583
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,360
Dip their prices that can go up like a hundred times the average which is

584
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Crazy

585
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,456
And that's why even Jessika trancik thinks that they should have

586
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Have a cap

587
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,784
And why Don Chris wants this

588
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
Sort of

589
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,112
Declawed version of that

590
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Which is

591
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,976
Look like a slightly more expensive. From 2 to 8

592
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
P.m.

593
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
Verses really following the mark

594
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
But they both

595
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,888
I think it's time we looked at

596
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,960
Redesigning the way our electricity is metered

597
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
Because solar

598
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
Has made everything

599
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
More,

600
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080
Houston Kris

601
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
Metering started

602
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,968
There Was An Architect guy and yeah

603
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,760
Actually talk to him

604
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:56,672
Really so you know that like he just did it without asking anybody

605
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
Run backwards

606
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
Just why are my building up

607
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,328
Encino and attach it to the boss

608
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,376
But the fact is that it

609
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:09,728
You know it it was like a commission on uniform state laws got together and said

610
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:14,336
What's design a net metering statue that will promote the development of distributed generation

611
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,920
You know when it's really large go rigorous way

612
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
Accident

613
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:23,808
And now it's everywhere and so it is high time for everybody to take a look at it

614
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,136
See what a rational well-designed and public policy would be

615
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:33,792
Is it will promote the development of distributed generation

616
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,120
Logical rigorous

617
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
Accident

618
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,240
And now it's everywhere and so it is high time for everybody to take

619
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Take a look at

620
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,336
See what a rational well-designed bit of public policy

621
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,296
Or maybe we'll just go back to Feeling by the life

622
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,136
I'm going to reduce my number of lightbulbs

623
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
I can I can handle that

624
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208

In a cluttered World a man-made sound

651
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
If

652
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,976
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

653
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:44,864

Technology

655
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
You talk to us

656
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,960
It is a creation of Sonic trash

657
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,032

Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

659
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
To make them more human

660
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,504
Turn the living room lights on

661
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
Okay

662
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
Dim the living room lights

663
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
50%

664
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
Okay

665
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:14,048
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

666
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,864
Makes for a much more natural experience

667
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,912
Turn the living room lights on

668
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,008
Dim the living room lights to 50%

669
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:31,712
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

Landscape is impacting our health

671
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,064
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

672
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,880

675
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,536
We need to talk about something

676
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:51,936
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives

677
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
Does routine

678
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,752
I think about it all the time is frustrating

679
00:27:55,008 --> 00:28:01,152
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

680
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,456
Then it may be time to seek help

We're on Instagram Tumblr and have a nice subreddit to

692
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,232
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

693
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:51,072
A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

694
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,632
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

695
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
That whines through a

696
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,960
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

697
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,496
We're looking the part

698
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,288
Might cost you your life

699
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:05,408
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

700
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:09,760
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

701
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:14,112
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

702
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:20,768
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff actually if I'm being honest

703
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,816
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that

704
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
Kind of thing

705
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,168
A few days ago Wesley Stern

706
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:33,568
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop was found dead in my private gym

707
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,152
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

708
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,504
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

709
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,528
Now

710
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,832
I need to clear my name

711
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:50,208
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

712
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
