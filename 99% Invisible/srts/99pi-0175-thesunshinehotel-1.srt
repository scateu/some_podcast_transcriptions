I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
The Bowery

24
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,544
In lower Manhattan is one of New York's oldest neighborhoods

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,592
So it's been through a lot of iterations

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,688
In the 1650s a handful of freed slaves were the neighborhood

27
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,712
First residence

28
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,552
This was back when you work was still a Dutch colony called New Amsterdam

29
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,344
In the Lower East Side of Manhattan was

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Farmland

31
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,512
By the early 1800s the neighborhood was a bustling through affair with elegant theaters and taverns and shops

32
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,584
By the late eighteen hundreds and become a city or place

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,656
Boots women's dance awesome prostitution

34
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,496
And by the 1940s the Bowery and become New York Skid Row

35
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,336
The place where down-and-out men could go and rent a cheap room for the night

36
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,640
And where the neighborhood too many flop houses

37
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:57,248
Mail course there's no room for a skid row in the Lower East Side of Manhattan

38
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,296
And the Bowery like the rest of the area

39
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,136
It's full of expensive places to live in fancy grocery store

40
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
But back in 1998

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
Before the last of the Flop House is closed its doors

42
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
Dave I say and Stacey Abrams and made one of my favorite radio documentaries of all time about one of these

43
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:20,032
These producers knew they're making a time capsule but I don't think they knew just

44
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,616
How fast and complete a transition New York was about

45
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:28,224
How to make even though most of New York City has moved on from these kinds of voices

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992

00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528

This is a needed in beating Hotel

53
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,032
Normally people come in and stay for a day or two and get out

54
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
But for some reason or another people come in they like

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
Interstate 4 year

This hotel in 1998 probably look

85
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,631
The same as it did in 1920

86
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
Like almost all of them

87
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,031
Blops the lobby is on the second floor of a narrow flight of stairs

88
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,615
It's just a large room with wooden floors on a cup

89
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Chad

90
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919

See if you can get a oil sensor

98
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,071
Teller lets his mother

00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,591
Headed to the John you got to see me

100
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
You weren't able to

101
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
Half the lobby you'll find the living

102
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
Quarters for a hunter

103
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,319
25 residence

104
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
The sunshine is one of the last

105
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,951
Places in the country where people live in a cubicle

106
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:23,327
Maybe it's a little hard to imagine for those of you living in wall Florence Circle

107
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,143
Picture of long hallway with a

108
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
Series of doors on the Eagles

109
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
Beside these

110
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
All the cube

111
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
4 x 6 no window

112
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,895
The cubicles are only 7 feet high so this chicken wire along the

113
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,479
App to keep the guys from climbing over into the Next Room

114
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
Really it's like living in a

115
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,343
Play Centre fogelman the living room 36a

116
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,415
Basically it's like the size of

117
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
Lego jail prison cell

118
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
It's all got a light

119
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
And bed

120
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
Mattress in a blanket

121
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
Without

122
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
Scream on the top

123
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,631
And basically that's about it

124
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
Very tiny

125
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
So small

126
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,823
You have trouble making the bed I've been in prisons jails

127
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Living upstate

128
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
Dos

129
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,687
What's 5 times bigger than my room

130
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:15,039
So it's not the Waldorf but where else can you find a room in New York for

131
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
$10

132
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,927
If it wasn't for this hotel a lot of these guys wouldn't have any place

133
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,255
All you have to do is look around like over there

134
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,839
You see that old guy there with the Snow White and the guitar

135
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:34,495
Eddie Eddie Bauer

136
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
The new day sunshine so that's that's good hey

137
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,711
Eddie sits all day in a corner of the hotel

138
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
Looking out the window

139
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,855
Play my playlist Johnny Cash the way it's mine

140
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:56,255
The funny thing about it is that he always plays the same songs over and over

141
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:03,167
Over again maybe I might sit down and come up with a new joint in my mind but by the time I pick up the guitar don't forget the tuna

142
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:09,567
I had my mind but he had a mental breakdown and ended up

143
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
Any news about it

144
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
Honda Hitomi

145
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,927
Play back so we went together then that's how we started that was 30 years ago

Lean on you for another

150
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
Sunshine is the last.

151
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,831
On the one hand it's probably as close as you can come to living in hell

152
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:57,951
125 dysfunctional guys crammed together in this old hotel

153
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,255
On the other hand it's

154
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
It's pretty interest

155
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:06,143
There was some hotels on the ground I did everything

Parentheses see that little elf and white guy walking through the lobby

159
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,455

00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
In my case

372
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
I started off the lights

373
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,663
I could probably so many people maybe everyone for all I know

374
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
Whitworth

375
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,551
Sweet dreams unifreight grew up in Ohio with an alcoholic mother and

376
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
He always

377
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
Spelled like a misfit

378
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,927
Zoe Baron himself in philosophy

379
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
Play in poetry

380
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,535
And then set off for the Bowery in 1960

381
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,863
Future live cheaply while undertaking his metaphysis

382
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
I had some

383
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,959
Crazy soaring Ambitions of figuring out everything

384
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Freaking out ever

385
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,823
I was all the old an impossible Quest

386
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
For truth

387
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,199
It's like singing from that song what's it all about Alfie

388
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,247
Who hasn't wondered what it's all about

389
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
Imperious ambitions

390
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Along those lines

391
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
I don't seem like a

392
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
Was making some progress was in toxic

393
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:43,071
After while it seemed like it was some crazy pipedream was they say you know

394
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,631
Figure that have been

395
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,959
I want more substantial heavy weights and Me by far

396
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,543
Through history you know and they didn't seem to come up with the answers

397
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
The big answers

398
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Yeah

399
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
So where do I get off

400
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
Thinking I had it but you know

401
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
Cancel.

402
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,247
Seems like one of those stories better left Untold

403
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
To me it seems

404
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:12,767

Dumped here by his son about two months ago or he doesn't eat anything but Oreo cookie

409
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,895

Ariel now he's down to 80 lbs now and jaundice

411
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,295
Marshall wouldn't last another week here in this

412
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,415
I called his son last night but he doesn't care

413

I mean it happens

415
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,399
In a place like this you know they're young we're very popular

416
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,935
With people being dumb

417
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,007
Give me the new map don't reach out to grab

418
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799

Clean up crew put in a bag and put in a bag

Smells like nothing you've ever

425
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,975
Smell before

Milk carton full of full of urine

429
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
The worst part

430
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,935
Cleaning up room like this

431
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,327
What were you going

432
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,607

Skagen

442
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,087
It's like a death house

443
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,647
Okay 7 months I've been here

444
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
Five guys have died

445
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
Okay

446
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,512
And these guys will never leave the building

447
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,328
I need months and months at a time

448
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,400
One guy I knew that leave disability for 1 year

449
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,960
He says Donald says I'm going to die in this

450
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
End.

451
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,848

Call Nan VA wake up in the morning

455
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
And

456
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,832
Sit in the bed

457
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
Smoke a cigarette

458
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,648
And save myself Donald

459
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,952
What the hell are you doing here

460
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,816
What the hell you doing with mostly people just lay

461
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,632
On their bed all day and their cubicle watching

462
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,960
TVR listening to the radio or staring into space

463
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,984
If sleeping in

464
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
Just keep

465
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
Vegetating

466
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
Annie's a little cell

467
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,360
With fluorescent light overhead

468
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,896
Coming through the chicken wire

469
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
No

470
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
The Starlight

471
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,992
That's a guy will call Max

472
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,040
Thought you didn't want his full name

473
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,344
Cubicle one

474
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
L

475
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,184
Max's of 30 year old Russian image

476
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,488
Skinny kid with a ponytail and

477
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Glasses

478
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:29,120
Unlike the other guys you meant Max is one of my short-term tenants

479
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:33,728
He left his wife and kids in New Jersey and Kami on a heroin binge

480
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
2 months ago

481
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
Is my chance

482
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
To get away where I just

483
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,896
Don't have to do anything for anyone and

484
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
Indulge

485
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,480
The maximum width Alabama

486
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,296
Being worried about what anyone's going to say or

487
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,368
I'm going to affect others no one knows that I'm here

488
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,160
It's just a complete getaway

489
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,696
Max's in Arkansas

490
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,024
And even though he's only been here for a short while

491
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
He managed to make it

492
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
Cubicle homey

493
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
Lit with candles

494
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
Piles of books on the

495
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
Floor

496
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
Imposters

497
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,544
There is a painting of ball

498
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
Saint Jerome was

499
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
A hermit

500
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Yuan

501
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
To the desert

502
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,944
Look by m sulfur

503
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,736
A very long time to try to

504
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,016
Seek knowledge

505
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Achieve illumination

506
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,160
In a sense that's what I'm doing till I guess

507
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,464
It's some protest

508
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
I enjoy it

509
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,632
It's like that movie The Cook the Thief the wife and her lover

510
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,448
Experiences so

511
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,520
Disgusting secret asking their son grow

512
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
But they make

513
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
A narcotic

514
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,664
I'm kind of making an art. Of experience in this

515
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,480
A couple of days later Max

516
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,040
Is arrested at the sunshine

517
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,112
They crashed him up against the wall several times

518
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,672
Handcuffed them took them out of here

519
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,488
And that means his room is available

520
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
Where anybody wants rent

521
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
He's just a clean out now

522
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
Nothing person

523
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
He's a cleaner

524
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
I'm going to clean them out

525
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
Sellersville maybe tomorrow

526
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
I'll probably sell it tomorrow

527
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
More than life

528
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,360
Trying to get my friend

529
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,224
One tenant leaves another

530
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,504
Checks in Bethalto

531
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,784
Hotel NOVOTEL

532
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,368
The sunshine will always be a dog

533
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
Wake up every morning with

534
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,208
Chicken wire just above you

535
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,024
Walls having you in on all sides

536
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
Alone

537
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
The stunning

538
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
Sad play

539
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,448
Sometimes that the sunshine I close my eyes and

540
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
Ripped off

541
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,288
I forget where I am just for a second or two

542
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,592
Suddenly I'm not in a flophouse

543
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,640
Hotel the sitting in some family

544
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,688
A cup of coffee

545
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,504
Then I wake up and I'm back at the house

546
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,344
Just like everyone else you're hoping for break

547
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,136
Waiting for that day when I can

548
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Final

549
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Check out

550
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
Sunshine Hotel

551
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
Wolverine

552
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,072
I hope you enjoyed your stay here while you were here

553
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,472
I always tell my tennis the same thing when they leave welcome to come back anytime

554
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,544
A good luck buddy

555
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Good luck

556
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Good luck

557
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,872
Good luck

558
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,944
Where were they going the next place I hope it's not

559
