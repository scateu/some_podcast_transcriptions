1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
This is 99% invisible

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:02,816
Roman Mars

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,936
It was a little bonus episode of 99% invisible and one of the big things we did this year

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:08,960
Was

5
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:11,776
Released a brand new show inside of a show

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,568
Created

7
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,872
And hosted in conceived and reported

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:19,968
By Avery Johnson when he was here with me in the studio

9
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,528
And what I want to talk to you about is

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,064
This was

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,928
A phenomenon it was called the fourth best podcast of the Year according to the New Yorker

12
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,208
So I wanted to

13
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,232
Talk to you a little bit

14
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,768
About the making of it

15
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,792
And

16
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,096
What you learned in the in the process of it

17
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,120
Both in terms of

18
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,168
The production of it as a as a show is

19
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,984
A piece of entertainment and information but also like

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
Personally I would

21
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,080
Affected your view of clothing your beautiful smile on everything

22
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,104
The first

23
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,384
What was it like

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,456
Like to have the show within a show and how did it feel

25
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
To be out there

26
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,016
As the host

27
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,928
We don't like how it's so scary I don't know your voice

28
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,744
Especially in this round what I didn't know anything about it

29
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,792
And yeah there's a

30
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,560
So much to

31
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
Synthesizing

32
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,400
Working on it for so long

33
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
I learned

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,728
So much

35
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,800
And it's really changed

36
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,336
The way I dress

37
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,616
And the way I shop

38
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,944
Hireling it's amazing so what do you mean by that

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,760
The funny thing is I think going into the series

40
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,808
I was like I am a close purse

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
I am a person who loves

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,416
After reporting a series

43
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,464
I am a person

44
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
Who hates Claire and I am a person

45
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,656
I'm a person who loves

46
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
Style and I love fashion

47
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
But

48
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
Lowe's

49
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Ricky

50
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Json

51
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
Explain the nuance

52
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,968
As we learned in episode number 5 of Articles of interest about denim

53
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
The process

54
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
Making clothes

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,112
Any kind of clothes is really wasteful

56
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,928
And we live in a world where it is

57
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,000
So easy to just buy new clothes

58
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
And that's what I used to do all the time not even thinking about it I think a lot of people who don't consider

59
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
Big shoppers

60
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,592
Just you know it here and there occasionally just impulsively buy things from the internet from us

61
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Store

62
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,920
And maybe sometimes it fits in sometimes

63
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,480
It's your style and sometimes it's not

64
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:34,112
Whatever then you donated to the Goodwill and that's good for the Goodwill and that is totally how I live

65
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,000
From the consumerism because you know you're going to donate it and clothes are these

66
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
And that lead

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
Donatable object

68
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
But that's

69
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
Not enough

70
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,168
It's no no because it

71
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Really

72
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,264
Most clothes end up in landfill

73
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Anyway

74
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
And

75
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,968
Goodwill and Salvation Army these amazing organizations provide this like a virtuous outlet for us to just continue getting rid of clothes

76
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,992
Buy new stuff

77
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
All the time

78
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,856
And when the cycle of Life by donut by donut by donut by donut

79
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,416
Which you know it's good to donate your clothes

80
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
But

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
It's not

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
The solution for overconsumption

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
And

84
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Close

85
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
Distribute

86
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
To 8%

87
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,216
All CO2 emissions in the world

88
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
Huge

89
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
Huge output

90
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:28,384
And we are just consuming too many new things until every designer I talked

91
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Thinking about this

92
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
Concerned about this worried about this

93
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
And

94
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,296
So many people are just like you need to stop buying

95
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
Yeah

96
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,928
Even the people who make the clothes Vivienne Westwood

97
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
Herself has this whole campaign she has your shirts what they buy less on them I don't know if she's selling them or not but

98
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,400
Honor Twitter does a video where she's like

99
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
I'm making this new collection

100
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
But you

101
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Because

102
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
I don't buy clothes

103
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,528
That's the tricky thing as someone who loves fashion and lifestyle

104
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,576
It's extremely hard to be like stop

105
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
Bayern because

106
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
It's a really important for myself

107
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
Expression

108
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,024
And as you grow and as you change

109
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,303
And as your

110
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:25,471
Entire body completely regenerate on a cellular level every 14 years you need to find new ways to express

111
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,543
Brace yourself and the world around you is changing the weather is changing like

112
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
You can't not

113
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
WEAR news

114
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Yeah

115
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
So how did you stay

116
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
The cycle of

117
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
I'm buying them

118
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
Ironically

119
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,831
My cell really pared-down in the course of reporting

120
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
Frau that's because I was traveling so much

121
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,231
I lived off of backpack and I had a uniform I wore

122
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,607
Is black overalls and a blue shirt every day and it was extremely embarrassing cuz I was interviewing these

123
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:59,007
Fashion designers Consultants you know and I was the

124
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:04,383
Unshowered mess in these clothes that I've been wearing over and over again and

125
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,455
I recommend everyone do this it was like going on a fast

126
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
Yeah I just have this one outfit and then I got

127
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Back

128
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Oakland

129
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
And

130
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:16,415
Suddenly look at my now in Norma Seaman closet

131
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
I guess I was just

132
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,559
So overwhelmed by the number of clothes I had him if I go to the Wonderland and I can

133
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
Play in this forever

134
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:31,519
Oh so you're saying that like it actually helped you not consumer buying you clothes as they were new to you

135
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
Totally

136
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,639
And actually owe this amazing producer Eleanor Kagan

137
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:43,039
Has this great little game she likes to play call the Pantone challenge see about a book of Pantone color wheels

138
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,439
And try to pick out outfits based on color wheel combinations just a helper like rifle around and dig out new thing

139
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
Are all these ways of like

140
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,535
Appreciating what you already have

141
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
But you know

142
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
But doesn't that you're never

143
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:02,239
You will check your body changes you change attitudes change and style is a thing

144
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
I used to have this idea

145
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,615
I used to think I was immune to fashion and I used to think that fashion people

146
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
Like get Vogue magazine

147
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,503
And a bit like it's the Bible and when Vogue says

148
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,903
Polka dots are in like you go out and you buy polka dots and you throw out your stripes and that's not how fashion works we all

149
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,439
Pay attention to Fashion

150
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
But the way it manifests is not from this

151
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,815
Ruling that comes down from on high it's just when you

152
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,887
Look in your closet and you think I have nothing to wear

153
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
Or when you see someone

154
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
Wearing something new and you like that one

155
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
What's kind of Interest

156
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,335
Hawaiian shirts episode they were talking about how the cuts

157
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,151
Hawaiian shirts have changed how to call her

158
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
We're pointed in the seventies and

159
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,343
Now you know they were like kind of box here in the nineties in there a little tighter know like Fashions change they just do

160
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
All

161
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Obey them

162
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
But the thing is

163
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:58,303
It's so easy to just scratch that itch right now to like seeing new style and be like I'm going to go online and just get it

164
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,607
And you can really easily

165
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
And this was a trap that I had

166
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
Falling into over and over again

167
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
And the person who changed my life

168
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,871
In this regard I went to a panel about sustainability just to do some research

169
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
This

170
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:19,295
Fashion consultant named Andy going through my name is Annie going through Dan die in fashion industry

171
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
I do like you know look

172
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,159
People say stop buying it's really hard to just quit

173
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
Set up to shame someone be like

174
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,279
Stop buying don't even buy

175
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
Awaited

176
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,607
Circumvent that

177
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
I guess I'd addiction or that poll is to buy something

178
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
That's used

179
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,007
There is this whole new

180
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
Market out there

181
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,383
A second-hand clothes the research is saying that we decide

182
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Card

183
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
Before a year

184
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,015
Is that we buy and then before a year is up

185
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Discard it

186
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
There's a

187
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
World of like

188
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,391
New looking clothes

189
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
It's a barely-used

190
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,279
I don't smell like mothballs they don't have stand on them and

191
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,583
Are these websites that you can go to

192
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Thredup

193
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
Poshmark is another one

194
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
The real real is another one

195
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
You can shop on them like

196
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:15,103
As though they are new clothes you search for your size you can look for your color you can look for the price range

197
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
And

198
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
You can just

199
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:22,783
Kind of scratch that itch that need to like scroll and look and see what's out there find the brands at you

200
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Typically by just

201
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,183
When I see something that I like I just checked want to be second hand stores

202
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,975
They have it instead

203
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,815
And this is not a way of buying less but it is a way

204
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
Of not buying any new material and it's also way really interrogating what I buy and some Justin

205
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,847
Constantly clicking it just helps we go wait a minute and it helps you realize do I really want it

206
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
If I do let's

207
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
Look

208
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
It's not even like digging through

209
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,319
Bins at the Goodwill it's not that involved it's one you know one or two searches

210
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,439
And it's helping me kind of wean myself off the habit

211
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
I'm just in possibly buying you things

212
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,327
So you can begin to pair down your consumption by buying second-hand

213
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
And then you can also donate

214
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
Second hand and then that's right

215
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Create

216
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
A little bit more time

217
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,287
Between a thing being made

218
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
Intuit landfill

219
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
Totally

220
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
If you were not

221
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,919
Going to spend all your money on new clothes

222
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,247
What would you spend your money on Avery truffelman

223
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,343
What I always spend my money on Roman Mars

224
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,719
Podcast

225
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Do the podcast

226
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
After you love the most

227
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:42,143
I also do the podcast that I work I actually done it to the podcast that I work for

228
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,983
Best radiotopia is the best

229
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Totally

230
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,567
And also you know like if you were going to

231
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
You go out in the world

232
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
And

233
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
Consume thoughtfully

234
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:59,039
I thought you should know things and that's a lot of what we do here not just an articles of Interest

235
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
That's what we do at night

236
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Invisible

237
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
And it's a

238
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
The thing that is

239
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,207
Quite virtuous it doesn't use a lot of

240
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,791
Carbon resources I don't know what the carbon footprint of podcasts are

241
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,631
Percent

242
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,703
So whatever you would spend

243
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751

00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
