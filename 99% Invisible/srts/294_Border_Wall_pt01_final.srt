Joe richman radio Diaries on this episode with the help of radio Diaries

41
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
I'm going to tell a few stories

42
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,816
About the physical border on the southern edge of the United States

43
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,888
And what happens when instead of people crossing the border

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
The border crossing

45
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Go Richmond

46
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,984
We'll take it from here

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
In 2006 President Bush

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,016
Signed a law to begin building in 18 ft high fence along a few key parts of the US Mexico border

49
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,576
The project went by different names

50
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
Operation gatekeeper in California

51
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,184
Operation Safeguard in Arizona

52
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
Play Texas they called it operation Hold the Line

53
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,096
Today that fence looks like a somewhat random dotted line

54
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
The entire border

55
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:51,776
And the Border fence is always been controversial but it's based on a very human impulse

56
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:56,128
To have an actual physical barrier that marks the imaginary one on the map

57
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,176
It's a simple idea

58
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,248
And like most things that turned out to not be so simple

59
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
Hello

60
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
Hello this is Pamela Taylor

61
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,648
So can you tell me where you are right now

62
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
I'm in my living room

63
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
I'm looking out the window

64
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,048
I shaved my front yard

65
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
And Beyond.

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
Is the fence

67
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,680
It is huge iron

68
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,984
About 20 feet tall

69
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,056
The paint was put in there by Homeland Security

70
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,872
Pamela Taylor is 86 years old

71
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176
You may have noticed she has a slight British accent

72
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
But she's an American citizen

73
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,600
After World War II she marries an American they moved to a small Brick House outside of Brownsville Texas

74
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
That's the house she's in right now

75
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
Which has been there for more than sixty years

76
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,512
At that house is technically in the US

77
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,048
But for the past 6 years

78
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
It's been on the wrong side

79
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
Defense

80
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
We are on the Mexican side

81
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,704
The fences in front of my home

82
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
So let me just go over this

83
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,128
Many people think about the Border fence they just assume it's on the border

84
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
The Rio Grande river is illegal border

85
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
Between the US and Mexico

86
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,344
But the Border fence doesn't follow all the natural Contours about River

87
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,696
If they follow the river it would be a winding fence

88
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,024
Whereas now because a straight fence

89
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:22,143
And therefore they did not need to install that much fence

90
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
And in the beginning

91
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:30,079
We were told this fence was going to go right through my living room

92
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
Luckily the ended up building it

93
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
About a mile North

94
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,527
Today Taylor has about a half-dozen neighbors need exact same situation as her

95
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
Down the road there's also a farm

96
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
Ana Golf Course

97
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,159
All on the Mexican side of the fence

98
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
We've gotten used to it now

99
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
We just can't go on and

100
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
A measurable about it

101
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
So how would you describe

102
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Where you are living

103
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,447
Well actually it's a no man's land

104
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,847
And I firmly believe that I shouldn't be paying taxes

105
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,759
A no-man's-land between two countries that's what our next story is about

106
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:18,975
The United States is not as big today as it was at this time yesterday

107
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,839
President Johnson and president Diaz ordaz of Mexico mad at the border today

108
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,631
Ended an old dispute

109
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,983
The Rio Grande River has been the border between the US and Mexico ever since text

110
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Is became a state

111
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
The problem is Rivers can move

112
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
That's exactly what happened in 18th

113
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
64

114
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,967
Torrential rains caused the river to jump its banks and go south

115
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,295
All of a sudden the Border was in a different place

116
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,879
What that meant is the Texas have gained a square mile of land

117
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
Was called the Chinese all

118
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
Names of the scrubby desert plant

119
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
The crew there

120
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,327
The Chinese I was a thorn in the side of us Mexico relations for a century

121
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
And then finally 50 years ago

122
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
The US gave the land back to Mexico

123
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,263
About that time thousands of people and moved to the Chinese at all

124
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
I made it their home

125
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
And that is where the story

126
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
Begins

127
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
My name is smiley okay me at 3

128
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:15,039
I grew up in the chimney selleria during the 50s and 60s

129
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
I live one street away

130
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
From the river

131
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,951
Which was the division between the two countries

132
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,743
The river was just

133
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,327
More like a highway that you have to cross to get to where you needed to be

134
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:33,727
There was a baseball team on the Mexican side and then it was a team on the El Paso side and they were just

135
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,799
Signal each other through crystals on and they would cross

136
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
That was just

137
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
Life with the river between us

138
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
This is an interview

139
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,575
Is part of the Chinese style oral history project

140
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
Mystery

141
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,927
Could I ask you to describe the neighborhood

142
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,743
Yes they were a lot of tenements

143
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
And a lot of

144
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
Small

145
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,607
I hate to say checks but that's what they were

146
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
They didn't have any

147
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
Electricity no running water

148
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:10,591
But you built one room and then you build another room and that you built another one room after the other state

149
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Baby, just

150
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Better off

151
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Money

152
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
Is Victor Guzman Garcia

153
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
Garcia Clan goes back to

154
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
About 386 years

155
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
In this area

156
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,695
A lot of Mexican interior thought that the Chinese are switch

157
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
Basically just a square mile of land

158
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
They thought it was us largest California

159
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
And that is probably had oil and two holes

160
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
So

161
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,959
Every time there was an issue between two countries

162
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,775
A Mexican would have course bring up these Chinese on

163
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:45,151
My name is Paul Kramer and I'm in a store near Vanderbilt University researching the history of atomic solid

164
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,271
In Mexico the Chinese are represented illegally occupied territory

165
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,111
But in the United States every two Americans had even heard of it

166
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,695
And then the 1960's that'll change

167
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
No really unexpected way

168
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
And this is NBC News

169
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
This government

170
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
As promised

171
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
Has maintained the closest

172
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
Surveillance

173
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
Of the Soviet military buildup

174
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
On the island of Cuba

175
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,807
Within the past Cuban Missile Crisis and specifically the fact that Mexico does not cut off its ties to cast

176
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:29,183
The Kelly ministration becomes very concerned that Mexico could be vulnerable in the Cold War

177
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
Suddenly there's a real willingness to remedy

178
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
The Chinese all dispute

179
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
To use it as a kind of bargaining

180
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
Until the big question is

181
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
The residents of this tiny patch of land

182
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
What's going to happen today

183
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:47,359
It's the letter from the international boundary and Water Commission to mr. Luis Rivera

184
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
Dear sir

185
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,735
We advise at the appraisal of your property would be undertaken as soon as practical

186
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,551
Preparatory to a position by the federal government

187
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
The song

188
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
S Kids R Kids

189
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
We were eavesdropping

190
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
And we heard there was going to be

191
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
Removal

192
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:09,887
We remember our fathers stomping around the kitchen same way they know they can't

193
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
We were Mexican by heritage

194
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,799
But we understood that we were American by nationality

195
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
People were given a choice of

196
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Going

197
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
Back to Mexico

198
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,735
And only one man that we know of

199
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
Actually accepted

200
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
To go back

201
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
Everybody also

202
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
No

203
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
But we all have to be out

204
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
October 19th

205
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
64

206
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,095
This is an interview with we wood

207
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
Former government real estate appraiser

208
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
Settlement

209
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,287
How did most of the people feel about leaving their home

210
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,103
It was mix

211
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
There's one case

212
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
Is that I can recall

213
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
And this lady

214
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
I had a very nice home

215
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
Better than the rest of them in the neighborhood

216
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,111
And she's not going to let us in

217
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
She couldn't speak English

218
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
Enough to get by

219
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:12,351
And she told me that she was not going to give her house to those goddamn next

220
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Nginx

221
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
Nothing go to hell

222
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,983
And I will keep my house and I will

223
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
Get my guns out and I will fight

224
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
And the day when it came to move

225
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
The United States Marshal

226
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
Pick her up bodily

227
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
And put her in a car

228
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
And put her furniture in storage

229
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,111
My name is Angie Nunez

230
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
It was a very big disappointment

231
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,975
Because they did not pay for the house

232
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
They paid us for the land

233
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,815
My father had just built

234
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,375
For extra rooms in our house

235
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
We had Central Heating

236
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,727
Keven Hatfield the bricks

237
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
Meat special

238
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
Adobe

239
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
With the hay

240
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,127
Because the house was going to be that much thicker that

241
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Warmer that

242
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
Nice whatever

243
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
And we had to leave all that

244
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,295
One by one the family started moving out

245
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
What was left behind were empty

246
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
Shell's of homes in

247
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:14,303
Windows are all boarded up and then yellow ribbon was placed on them so that we couldn't even go into the bank

248
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,887
So it look like a crime scene that is yellow

249
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Tape all over

250
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
Until the only family left was hours

251
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Hours

252
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Historically was the last

253
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
And I remember my dad said

254
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Don't look back

255
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
You are forbidden

256
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:40,415
Aztec welcome at the US Mexican border for President Johnson

257
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
Gustavo Diaz ordaz

258
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,279
Arriving together just have to let century-old border dispute

259
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
I remember

260
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,143
Thousands and thousands of people

261
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
On top of the bridge and everything

262
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:57,311
And I could see Johnson I could see him sitting at the table and yes or Des

263
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
Senor Presidente

264
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
It'll stop sneezing America

265
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
Jansen

266
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,551
Pretty much the whole of the White House with congressman and senators and everybody was here

267
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,599
This was a big thing

268
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,903
An unpredictable River

269
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,487
Has been converted into a control source

270
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
Of water

271
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
For Mexicans

272
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
Are Americans alive

273
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,935
C4yourself

274
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
By December 1968

275
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Mexico and United States

276
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
Jointly sponsor

277
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,871
The digging of a cement lined Channel

278
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
That will

279
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,943
Make the river go where

280
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,783
The authorities wanted to go in terms of maintaining the boundary that they want

281
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:45,439
After speeches the two men walked over to press the buttons that would detonate a retaining wall about a mile away and send

282
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
The water down its new channel

283
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,791
At the appointed time the two presidents

284
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,863
Approach this black box it's been set up on the bridge

285
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
Which has these two Redbox

286
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
And it supposed to hit the buttons

287
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
And detonate

288
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,847
These explosives to release the mighty Rio Grande into its new channel

289
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:08,479
In fact I smoke nothing happens

290
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,807
And so very quickly ignition sueldos the Damned

291
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,623
And release the river completing the ceremony

292
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
The second hundred years but it's finally done Mexico has its piece of scruff land back their bracket as

293
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,679
What to do with it and the river is once again the international boundary it cost 40 million dollars

294
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
Let's write it this way

295
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,543
Jack Perkins NBC News El Paso

296
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
Well I'll show you

297
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
The river is now

298
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Encased

299
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
And cement

300
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
That poor thing

301
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,279
It's about 5 feet across

302
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
It looks like a muddy creek

303
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,471
Where we used to go out with wide sometimes they had

304
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
Quite a bit of water

305
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
And that would Ripple across

306
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,967
There's only so much control a man can do on a river

307
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Sooner or later

308
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,391
I personally think that river is going to do what Mother Nature has Tata to do

309
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
To move

310
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Well I woke up

311
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
This morning

312
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,959
Do the door let it go

313
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
I found that I was living in Old Mexico

314
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:52,159
Well I was born in America in El Paso

315
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:03,167
The song you're hearing right now is called the Chinese all Blues written and recorded by Bob Burns and the teakwoods P9

316
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
1963

317
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,519
A year before the Chinese all was handed back to Mexico

318
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,383
This story was produced by radio Diaries that's Joe Richmond Nellie Gillis

319
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,783

At the tail end of 2017 our own Avery Kauffman took a trip to the border for sale

332
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,039
Look at the architecture of the border wall and the new border wall prototypes

333
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
We'll talk to her about what she found

334
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
Right after this

335
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,023
Between the beats

336
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
Bongs and chatter of our devices

337
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,911
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

338
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
If

339
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:46,335
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

340
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
Technology

341
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
He talked to us

342
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
It is a creation of Sonic trash

343
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,343
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

344
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,927
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

345
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
To make them more human

346
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
Turn the living room lights on

347
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Okay

348
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,167
Dim the living room lights to 50%

349
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
Okay

350
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,359
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

351
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,663
Makes for a much more natural

352
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Experience

353
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
Turn the living room lights on

354
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
Dim the living room lights

355
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
50%

356
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:35,999
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375

00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:57,247
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives

363
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Routine

364
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

365
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:06,463
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

368
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Oh my God

369
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
Black podcast

370
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
Build That Wall

371
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
Build That Wall

372
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,295
Build That Wall

373
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
Build That Wall

374
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:39,487
Truly after Trump took office in March of 2017 US Customs and Border Protection put out a request for proposal

375
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,839
Asking private companies for designs of a wall that would divide Mexico

376
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
In state

377
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,703
There were two different requests for proposals or rfps

378
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
1rp was a wall design made of concrete

379
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,079
The other was for a design made of quote on quote

380
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Other materials

381
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,431
They were to be between 18 and 30 ft tall

382
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:02,527
From the submissions they received Customs and Border Protection selected 8

383
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,063
And turn them into prototypes

384
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:08,159
That's October our own Avery Chapman went down to see what they look like

385
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,975
Well I'm glad you're okay

386
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
I found myself in a crowd of reporters

387
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,423
From writers in the guardian and Univision and fox

388
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,727
We'd all been given hard hats

389
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
A neon yellow vest

390
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,823
We all piled into an air-conditioned van

391
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
But we were brought out to a construction site

392
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:32,735
Cameramen unpacked and hoisted their video cameras like great mechanical carcasses

393
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,295
Anchors applied fresh makeup and did warm ups

394
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,623
And then we swarmed around Roy Via Real

395
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,439
All of us jostling to get our microphones in his face

396
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,999
First name is Roy Roy last name vital

397
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
V i l l

398
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,679
A real acting Chief Patrol agent for the u.s. border patrol in the San Diego sector

399
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,727
He was showing us these eight prototypes

400
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
New border wall

401
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
Between the United States

402
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:02,175
And Mexico seven of the eight have been completed and the 8th when should be completed by the end of the

403
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,991
These 8 Simple rectangles

404
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,039
Border wall are massive

405
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
Each is 30 ft tall

406
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
It's striking in person

407
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,951
If they were actually formed into one continuous wall

408
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,511
They block off the mountains in the distance

409
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,583
By now you've probably seen pictures of these prototype

410
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Bar made of concrete

411
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,167
Four are made of other materials

412
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
What is bright blue

413
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,495
One has molding on the side to make the

414
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,287
Concrete look like cobblestone

415
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,615
Half of them around and tops to make it harder to grip

416
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,455
MMD determination of of the ultimate design is based on

417
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
Testing evaluation

418
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
We have three specific

419
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
Requirements

420
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,623
Which are looking at the Subterranean ability to dig underneath it prototypes

421
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Penetrability

422
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
The aspect

423
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
Being able to breach

424
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,511
Some way to grade the Prototype

425
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
And scalability

426
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,887
The setup of the eight different prototypes only look like a design competition

427
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,679
So I asked Via Real

428
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,727
Will there be a winner here

429
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Olympia winner

430
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:05,151
Ultimate the winner is the US government is going to be us in that this is going to enhance our portion

431
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
Nicely played

432
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,759
Conceptually what we may have is we could have a singer design that is going to be

433
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:14,111
Utilize it then some signal on the border or we have a combination of the designs

434
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
Pair together and then applied

435
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
Different areas along the border

436
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,768
It's not exactly clear what will happen with the Prototype

437
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,352
Customs and Border Protection never specified if they were intended

438
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,424
For the entire border or parts of the Border

439
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,472
Or to fortify existing walls

440
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:36,128
Because of course the part that Trump didn't mention in his campaign is that over one-third of the u.s. Mexico border

441
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,456
Is already covered by a wall for a barrier from time

442
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
So now we are here in this Administration which ran on the platform to said I'm going to build a wall and everybody clapped

443
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,488
There's already 650 my wall in place

444
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:57,632
This is Ronald real professor of architecture at UC Berkeley and author of the book border wall as architecture

445
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,472
In his book he writes about the long history of the border wall

446
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,752
It has a long life

447
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
It's been around for some time

448
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,592
It's evolved from

449
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:11,712
Stone Cairns these are Stones placed along the border to save where the Border was

450
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:16,832
Because it's just a frontier originally real says no one knew where that borderline

451
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
Actually was

452
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
An engineer's from

453
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
Mexico and the United States

454
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,256
Went to this kind of no-man's-land Frontier Zone

455
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
After 1848

456
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,584
Just figure out where to place

457
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,680
Is demarcation Stones piles of stones were put up in Lego monuments

458
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,520
Fences were constructed mostly the fences work truck to keep cattle out

459
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,800
Is there ranches on both sides

460
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
Eventually

461
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
Some of those fences

462
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,432
Became more aggressive especially between the cities

463
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
Particularly

464
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,736
Between San Ysidro

465
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Tijuana

466
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,112
In 1990 the Army Corps of engineer came to that Tijuana border

467
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,952
They brought over 40000 carbon steel corrugated

468
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,280
Each plank 12 ft long and 1/4 inch thick

469
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,096
These have been made for the Vietnam War

470
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,144
Portable Landing mats for helicopters

471
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,472
Annies helicopter landing mats were turned up on their sides

472
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,776
Into the first official border wall

473
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:13,664
More and more Landing mats were added and today they're over 60 miles of this Landing mat wall

474
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,016
And then in other parts of the Border other kinds of walls and fences work

475
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
I'm different

476
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,600
All varying based on the topography

477
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:27,488
Pedestrian fences that allow for visibility on both sides vehicular fences that are meant for cars not the

478
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:33,376
Cross in his book railless over a dozen types of border wall

479
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,704
And this is here in the Algodones Dunes

480
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,008
California floating fence

481
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Snakes over

482
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,824
Huge mountainous Dunes

483
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,872
And has these mechanical buttress

484
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,920
But keep it from sinking into the sand

485
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
Dutch designed to be lifted

486
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
Placed back on the dunes

487
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Otherwise

488
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
Just let it go it just sinks

489
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,576
Amazing

490
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,184
The border wall is already a building project with significant weight behind it

491
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,512
Is unfettered bylaws that regular building projects

492
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
Have to abide by

493
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
And that's particularly because of Easter

494
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
Secure fence Act

495
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,424
Passing 2006 back when George W Bush was president

496
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,728
The secure fence Act of 2006

497
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
Was created

498
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
So that it could

499
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Usurp

500
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,384
Any other law that existed

501
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
In the United States

502
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
So any environmental

503
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
Protection laws

504
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,504
This is more important

505
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,808
Any Native American heritage

506
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,880
This is more important any Wildlife Act

507
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
Secure fence Act

508
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
Is more important than any of them

509
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
And so

510
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
The wall can be constructed

511
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
Inhibit

512
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,888
Which brings us back to those new prototypes that are being considered

513
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,192
And the Press junket I went to back in October

514
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
The border is very dynamic

515
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,544
Fluid Dynamic there is

516
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Climate

517
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
Some form happening everyday

518
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,408
The prototypes will help influence

519
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
Beef

520
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
The future.

521
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,504
Future development of our border infrastructure system

522
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,808
When they request for proposals went out

523
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,088
Architects for like

524
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
What do we do

525
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,696
Number of architecture firms submitted some designs for border wall

526
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,792
And other Architects admitted blank sheets of paper to waste his time

527
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
Ultimately

528
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
Customs and Border Protection didn't choose

529
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
Any architects

530
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704
At all these prototypes

531
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,008
Like the vast vast majority of

532
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
The Delta environment

533
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
Bridges

534
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
Tunnel Towers houses

535
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,872
Does airports luxury apartments in prison

536
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
Or mostly made

537
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
Buy General country

538
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
These giant construction firms

539
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,040
Are very practical

540
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
They safely arrived

541
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,624
Huge structures on time

542
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
And on budget

543
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
Their goal is to

544
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
Jacquee's the club

545
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
Which in this case

546
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
Is the US government

547
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,304
They prototypes were manufactured

548
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
Her by 6

549
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Companies

550
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,656
Do you mind walking us through these companies are

551
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,240
I'm going to defer that to mr. to sell cuz I don't know them

552
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,544
Route to say I was the spokesperson for border

553
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,128
And he wasn't quite familiar with the construction companies either

554
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,432
The best he could do was read them off a list

555
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,248
Glpa North Augusta

556
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
Cadel

557
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
Sterling

558
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,112
Kwwr Fisher

559
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
Sand

560
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:07,744
To be fair at the time I didn't know these companies either

561
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,792
I had never heard of them before

562
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,864
But I've lately been in one of their structures somewhere

563
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,192
In one of their tunnels or airports are office building

564
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,520
The companies that made these walls are

565
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
WG Yates & Sons from Mississippi

566
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,152
Open North America in Israeli company based in Maryland

567
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:29,504
Caddell Construction Alabama Texas Sterling Construction of Houston

568
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,856
Kwr construction from Arizona and Fisher sand and gravel from Arizona

569
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
Now

570
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,672
Because of the wall prototype

571
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,720
People know these companies

572
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,280
And they're talking about their relationships today

573
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:49,728
We separate return from the border I went to an Oakland city council meeting where they were considering passing an ordinance to forbid

574
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,800
Contracting with any of the companies bidding on the border wall

575
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:58,688
How to take my colleagues and fans for supporting our resolution on the border wall to make sure that

576
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,992
None of our tax dollars are spent

577
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,808
Being invested with any contract or any business

578
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,088
That is building

579
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:11,488
This divisive wall that will do nothing to make us safer other municipalities

580
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Around the country

581
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,048
Including New York City in LA

582
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,424
And even floated on the state level in Arizona California Illinois New York Rhode Island and Wisconsin

583
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,752
This is a Prohibition on the city of Oakland

584
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,056
Doing business with contractors

585
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
Build

586
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
Trump

587
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
Border wall

588
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:33,760
And the City of all countries have absolutely nothing whatsoever

589
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
To do with it

590
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,344
But they're also critics of these kind of ordinances

591
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
Luxury Smith

592
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,024
Representative from associated general contractors or AGC who stood up at the Oakland city council meeting and testify

593
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,424
Behalf of the contractors Freedom of Choice has any policy or regulation that prohibits a contractor from bidding a

594
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,288
Construction project because contractor should be able to choose which projects they wish to bid on

595
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,872
Without fear of reprisal or discrimination but the ordinance passed

596
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
Companies entering contracts

597
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
City of Oakland

598
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,016
Say to build a tunnel or a condo complex

599
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:09,088
Will be required to declare that they are not

600
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,904
Part of border wall construction and do not plan to be

601
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,488
And this goes beyond those companies already involved in the Prototype

602
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,560
Because new Border Construction is happening

603
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Separately

604
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,608
8 prototypes

605
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,400
On the San diego-tijuana border

606
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,472
When I talk to Customs and Border Protection people

607
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,032
They're thinking is that you know

608
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,336
He's the president this is what he wants

609
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
So we're going to

610
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
We're going to follow his

611
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
Orders

612
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,456
So they're going through the motions

613
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,992
Buildings prototype

614
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,808
But when it comes down to it that's not going to work

615
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,088
That's Melissa Del Bosque

616
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,136
A reporter from the Texas Observer

617
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:49,280
And according to an article she published last year there already plans in motion for the First new section of the border wall

618
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,352
Which will run through a wildlife refuge in South Texas

619
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,168
It will be built by Michael Baker International

620
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,752
Construction firm who was not involved in the prototypes at all

621
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,312
The proposed design will be a levee wall

622
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,128
Which is not among the designs in the prototypes

623
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,688
Pictures of the prototypes what should we make of that

624
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,248
I don't know I think they're going to

625
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,296
Sit there like Stonehenge probably

626
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,832
You just view them as a symbol

627
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Yeah

628
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Yeah totally

629
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,696
I don't think they mean much other than

630
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,744
Filling his campaign promise

631
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:25,888
So whether or not these particular prototypes on display will ever actually be built

632
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,936
There will be more walls

633
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,776
What will happen is what has been happening for decades

634
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,800
And it's not

635
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,384
Special to the Trump administration at all which is that

636
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,688
Some walls are going to be constructed

637
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,016
Because this has been happening to many presidencies

638
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,808
Republican and Democrat

639
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
Professor Ronald Rael again

640
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,648
And so I imagine that's what's going to happen

641
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,184
There's going to be some walls built

642
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,280
Rail has been studying the various border walls for years

643
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,096
He's come to believe they're ineffective and inhumane

644
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,936
So we first saw the pictures of Trump's prototypes

645
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:05,056
He thought of the famous saying show me the 20-foot wall in 21 foot ladder

646
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:09,920
And so real got to work on a simple Act of protest using his skills of an architect

647
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,480
Based on the images of the wall prototypes

648
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,040
He drew up some designs for ladders

Might cost you your life

678
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,064
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

679
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,416
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

680
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:31,744
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

681
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
A dad

682
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,120
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

683
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,424

I'm one of the main got to know how to do that guy

Was found dead in my private gym

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had some

689
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,184
Nothing to do with it now

690
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,232
