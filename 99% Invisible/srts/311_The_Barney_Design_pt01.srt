I'm Roman Mars

30
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,440
On a March afternoon in 1996

31
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
Toronto rap

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,024
There's a brand-new team in the NBA at the time

33
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,072
Playing the Chicago Bulls

34
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,120
Jordans

35
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,936
The Bulls were the best team in the league

36
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
And the Raptors

37
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
We're pretty terrible

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,056
36000 fan showed up that day

39
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,104
And the Raptors actually beat the Bulls

40
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
But it was a mostly meaningless game at the end of the

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
Season this is reporter Whitney Jones

42
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,296
What's the weather is going to be about this game isn't who won or have a team

43
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
Who's played

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
But the way they look

45
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,416
There's the Bulls were just classic NBA

46
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
I've had the same logo since 19

47
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
66

48
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
They're wearing their red away jersey

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
Basically like every Chicago Bulls jersey

50
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,656
It's red with the word bull was written across

51
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
The front and black and white letter

52
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
It's simple

53
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
Classic

54
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:23,360
But then there's the Toronto Raptors

55
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,736
The team is wearing their white home uniforms which have Jagged silver and black pinstripe

56
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
As if they were

57
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:36,160
Cut by slashing Raptor Claws and then across the whole front for the giant red.

58
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
Basketball playing Dinosaur

59
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,280
Who himself is wearing sneakers and a uniform a totally different uniform

60
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
And he dribbling a basketball

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
And that was just their home uniform

62
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,936
The road jerseys that you're even more fun

63
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
They were bright purple

64
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,640
All this including the Raptors name had been inspired by the Velociraptors in the wildly successful movie duress

65
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
Beihai Park

66
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,712
But these jerseys got compared to a different

67
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
Much friendlier 90s dinosaur

68
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,416
Dinosaur

69
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:15,328
That's now known as the Barney design because

70
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
Their Road uniforms

71
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
Purple

72
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
This is

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Paul Lucas

74
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:23,264
Uniform obsessive and writer of a column an ESPN called yunnan

75
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,824
It's it looks so cartoonish conservative

76
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
You look at it in

77
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
Like really that's a professional

78
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Top-level

79
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Team

80
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,016
The Raptors jersey may have been particularly garish

81
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
But it wasn't the only Jersey of its kind

82
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,904
The 90s were this insane decade of NBA uniform design

83
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,744
Reduce some of the wildest jerseys that have ever graced a basketball court

84
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,584
Design the likes of which had never been seen before

85
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
And haven't been seen since

86
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:55,520
Like the Atlanta Hawks red and black Jersey with a fierce-looking hawk swooping in across the entire front of it

87
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
Holding a basketball and its little Talent

88
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
What are Milwaukee Bucks green unit

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,432
With a giant picture of a purple stag

90
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
Call Lucas called this one great

91
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
Hemingray in the sense that it was

92
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
So awful it was great

93
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
They had this you know this person

94
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
Garish purple and green color patterns

95
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
Ridiculous butt

96
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
It definitely all these designs

97
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Definitely

98
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
They pushed and extended

99
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,143
The idea of what a basketball uniform could be or should be

100
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,983
And many of these designs can be traced back to one man

101
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
I'm Tom Brady

102
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,615
I joined the NBA 1990s League's first creative director

103
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
Tom group in Chicago

104
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,503
Sketching Andre sketching the logos of his hometown Chicago Blackhawks

105
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,295
Another classic Pro Hockey

106
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,623
Comes love for sports and eye-catching art

107
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
May this new NBA game

108
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Dream job

109
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
My first day at the NBA was just

110
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
Filled with excitement

111
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
I'd always been a big sports fan

112
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
And I loved

113
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Design

114
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
I studied graphic design

115
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
Cheer Columbia College back in Chicago

116
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,287
So when I walked in the door in June of 1990 I kind of had a pinched my

117
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
Cuz I really didn't

118
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Believe it was happening

119
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:09,247
Before Tom O'Grady join the League most NBA jerseys look something like that classic Bulls jersey

120
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,599
It's simple two or three color schemes with the team names across the front

121
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,951
There might have been strike here or there may be a cool font but that was about it

122
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,279
And they weren't designed by designer

123
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,119
The process of Designing team uniforms is mostly left up to

124
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
The team equipment managers

125
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,959
Because they were responsible for getting

126
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
The players outfitted

127
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
To play the game

128
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
Mostly this consisted of the equipment manager

129
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
Flipping through a catalog

130
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
Choosing a designer like

131
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
The right colors

132
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,199
It was not a sophisticated business

133
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Let's say that

134
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
They were happy just to get Uniforms on the players back

135
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
But that was all about to change

136
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,367
Because in 1988

137
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,439
Charlotte Hornets introduce a radical new idea

138
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
The color teal

139
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,559
In this archival news footage from 1988

140
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,399
Hornets player Kelly tripucka stands on stage in front of flashing camera

141
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,727
Any rips off his teal Tearaway warm up

142
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
To reveal the Hornets new uniform

143
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,455
Teal was not a traditional NBA jersey

144
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Not NBA red

145
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,551
It's not NBA blue it's not self

146
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
Fix screen if not Lakers yellow

147
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,903
Tom O'Grady had nothing to do with a teal Hornets

148
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,487
But he took it as a sign that the league was ready for Boulder design

149
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,047
It was I was at the kind of a leap of faith

150
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:32,447
Fridley to say you know this is not really something we've seen before it but as an expansion team will probably let you have this one because

151
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
Maybe there's something we can learn

152
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
It turned out fans love

153
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
The teal Hornets Jersey

154
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
It looks fresh

155
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Indifferent

156
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,967
It was really very popular they soon became

157
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Known as the Man of Steel

158
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
In all sudden

159
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,343
The Charlotte Hornets have gained great recognition

160
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
Before they never played the bass

161
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:56,511
When Tom O'Grady was hired as the NBA's first creative director two years later in 1990

162
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,583
He wanted to push Jersey design even further

163
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
Not just the colors

164
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
But the designs on the uniform

165
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,519
Until the early nineties there has been real limits to how Wild you could get with these designs

166
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
Because all the details

167
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,383
The numbers the names and the logos had to be sewn on

168
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,943
To do any kind of complicated graphics

169
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
Would have taken a massive amount of embroidery

170
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,599
And all that thread would have added additional weight made the Jersey hotter to wear

171
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:26,463
But soon after Tom O'Grady join the NBA he would get some new tools to work with

172
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
Computer programs like Photoshop and illustrator

173
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,327
Helped him dream up new logo designs

174
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,911
And was a new technique to get those drawings onto a Jersey

175
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
It was called dye sublimation

176
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,751
Sublimation changed everything

177
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,591
Sublimation is a process of printing dye directly into the fabric

178
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,663
No for the first time you could design something in Photoshop

179
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
You can make it big and you could add a bunch of different colors

180
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,831
Then with sublimation you can basically print that design straight onto the material

181
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
Without any embroidery or extra weight

182
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
So

183
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,487
It allowed us to start to take things we would never normally even

184
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Consider doing

185
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
On a Jersey

186
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,863
And we started doing more outrageous uniforms

187
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
The stuff because we could

188
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
We can

189
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
So we will

190
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
Comes first big design was for the Phoenix Suns

191
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
We're celebrating our 25th year in the league

192
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
They were moving into a new Arena

193
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
They wanted a new look

194
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
Soto met with their team owner Jerry Colangelo

195
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,039
Gary is great he was a fellow chicagoan so as soon as he heard my accent he's like

196
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,903
I think we're going to get along you know I think of Chicago guys kind of get this here's what I want to do

197
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:32,255
I want to have a logo that's going to last for the next 25 years I don't want to have to change

198
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
I want something futuristic

199
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
The classic

200
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,631
So Tom and his team started on the Suns redesign

201
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,727
They come up with this big basketball that's also a son

202
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,567
Aziz long red to orange gradient sun rays coming off

203
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
And then they print this

204
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,175
And a bright purple background under their New Jersey

205
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,247
It's not exactly what I would call Classic but it is bold

206
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
Definitely both

207
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,135
As luck would have it the Phoenix Suns made it to the NBA finals last year

208
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,463
And the whole country got to see that bright purple jersey

209
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,023
With its blazing basketball Sun

210
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
All over national TV

211
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,863
We got exposure that uniform that

212
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
Was

213
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Priceless

214
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
That changed

215
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Everything

216
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
For us we were able to do

217
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,615
Things with uniforms that we could not imagine even two years before that

218
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,967
Like a teal Detroit Pistons jersey with a flaming horse head logo

219
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,551
Wear a pinstripe Houston Rockets Jersey featuring a cartoon rocket

220
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
With an angry face on it

221
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,439
Over the course of the decade 2/3 of NBA teams got new uniforms

222
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
With new logos and new colors

223
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
There was a lot of teal and purple

224
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,631
3D lettering and oversized Graphics were everywhere

225
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
We look back on and see Wild

226
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Some of the stuff

227
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
Capri Outlander

228
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
That's okay cuz that's what was happening at a time

229
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,335
The technology let us go wild

230
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,431
Atoms boss NBA Commissioner David Stern

231
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,247
Gave him the freedom to keep pushing the designs further

232
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,575
He said you know if this is what selling any of you telling me this is what's going to

233
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
Work at retail

234
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Count Me In

235
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,999
Before the 90s the NBA wasn't doing much with merchandising

236
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,863
If a fan wanted to buy a jersey they had to pay the full cost of a genuine stitched

237
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
NBA game Jersey

238
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
Sometimes over $200

239
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
With all these popular new designs

240
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,055
Tom and others at the NBA got thinking

241
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
Why don't we

242
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
You know have a

243
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
A jersey that we can sell for about 2

244
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,943
45 to $50

245
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
That looks similar to the game Jersey

246
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,063
And we saw this business explode

247
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
Me know in 5 years

248
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
It went from a

249
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Almost like

250
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
Baseline of nothing

251
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
A multi-millionaire

252
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,511
Our business largely on the jerseys

253
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
We were designing

254
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,911
The Arab outlandish NBA uniforms reached its apex in 1995

255
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,959
Wechat Jersey we talked about at the beginning

256
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
The one from Toronto

257
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
One that some people call the Barney design

258
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,383
We were told directly by the team owner at the time John bateau

259
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,199
I would like to Happy Meal box of uniform design

260
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
We can look at in public like what

261
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Did you mean by that

262
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,855
He said I'm not going to wear this uniform forever aventino

263
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
Kids don't eat out of Happy Meal box

264
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,463
Forever but if you going to get the kids into your

265
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Store

266
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,279
You're going to win him over

267
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
Happy Meal design isn't a term yet

268
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
Making it 1 right now

269
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,191
The goal was to convince hockey loving kids in Toronto

270
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
That they should care about this new basketball

271
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
And so we crazy

272
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
Purple uniform

273
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,919
What these Jagged Edge cloth Pinstripes that look like a raptor come and ripped it

274
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,247
And then I slapped a big dinosaur right in the middle of it

275
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
And they made it red

276
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Because

277
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Canada

278
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,927
You wanted red wraps up to represent Canada which made all the sense in the world

279
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,975
I don't know how much sense it made

280
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
MoDOT Jersey it sold

281
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,119
I think it was the top-selling expansion team logo we ever did even today

282
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
Sales are through the roof

283
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,007
Before they ever played a game

284
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
Before the team had even signed a single player

285
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,895
The Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise

286
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,455
What is the nineties came to an end

287
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
Change was afoot

288
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,807
And stuff was about to get a lot more

289
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Boring

290
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,135
By the early 2000 the NBA

291
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,183
I become a booming Global industry

292
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,767
And Wealthy business people were suddenly interested in team ownership

293
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,607
People like Howard Schultz who turns Starbucks into a multibillion-dollar business

294
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
In 2001 Schultz about the Seattle SuperSonics

295
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,495
And he came into the league with a whole laundry list

296
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Changes to make

297
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
He wanted to replace the Hip Hop

298
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
You here in the arena on Game Night

299
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Jazz

300
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,431
He wanted his team to stick to the fundamentals

301
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
Best flashy dunks in Showboat

302
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,807
The favored team basketball over individual Stars

303
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,159
Who's actually really bad for his team because it pissed off their actual Stars

304
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Also Schultz

305
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,231
Hated the sonics 90s lock

306
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
Have been designed

307
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,559
Another Bernard Powelton

308
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,887
We were able to take this kind of basketball spinning around

309
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
Space Needle and kind of Heaven

310
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
Superman fonts in

311
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
Added Ford sonnichsen

312
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,103
In there and they change the colors from green and gold

313
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,919
The dark green red and a metallic bronze

314
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
Old Howard jazz instead of hip-hop Schultz

315
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Was not a fan

316
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,831
So we hired Seattle design firm hornall Anderson

317
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,391
Completely remake the sonics graphic identity

318
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,207
Jersey's warm-ups logos

319
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
Everything

320
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,535
So so damn excited

321
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
This is Andrew Wicklund

322
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
Who is the lead designer on the

323
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
What

324
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
The sonics look like at that time too and

325
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,311
A lot of other teams frankly that have been rebranded in the

326
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
90's show

327
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Yeah it was it was

328
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
Can the candy store

329
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
The directions were given was clear

330
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,807
Immediately go back to the old classic green and gold color scheme

331
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
And do something iconic

332
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
Howard's words

333
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
Where I want this to be something

334
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
That nobody would ever want to change I want it to be

335
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,327
The Chicago Cubs the New York Yankees

336
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
Is the Green Bay Packers

337
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
Those are

338
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,703
Solid shapes simple shapes they are

339
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
Simple color palettes

340
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Simplification

341
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
Is it strength

342
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,919
By the start of the 2001-2002 season

343
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Everything was in place

344
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
Green and gold

345
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
No 3D anything

346
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,319
No giant logos across the chest

347
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,415
Do uniforms look like an update to the ones that started wearing in the late 70s

348
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:25,791
But if Howard Schultz was committed to making the sonics and iconic franchise with an iconic look

349
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
His commitment didn't last very long

350
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
In 2006 he sold the team

351
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,935
The new owners move the sonics

352
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
To Oklahoma City

353
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,287
But Schultz's aesthetic Vision Ripple throughout the league

354
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
Throughout the odds one team after another

355
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,151
Slowly return to the old color scheme

356
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,711
And lost their big graphic Jersey

357
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,783
Even the Raptors look has completely changed

358
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,599
This year the two main jerseys were red and white

359
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,415
And they just say raptors on the front and a symbol font

360
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
No crazy claw marks

361
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:58,303
No dinosaurs

362
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Here is Tom O'Grady egg

363
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
They're just there's nothing to them

364
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,167
There's a zero there lifeless

365
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
And I don't get it

366
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,007
Say what you will about Tom Brady's jersey

367
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
But they were not

368
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Lifeless

369
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,127
Is designed are mostly gone from the NBA now

370
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
They live on

00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
Sports Illustrated wrote quote

Toronto Raptors cartoon dinosaur logo

377
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Is one of the worst

378
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
In all sports

379
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Thankfully

380
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
It will soon be extinct

381
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
What time does it mean when people call is designs Garrett

382
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
Or even ugly

383
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
He's proud of that Raptors

384
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,127
I was meant to be provocative it was meant to be kind of eye-catching

385
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,783
We could have taken at start out with you no 72-point have vodka that says Toronto and a big number on the back and call it a day

386
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,367
I think that would not have been a memorable Identity or no

387
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,415
A great way to introduce a new team

388
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
Sentence for Newmarket

389
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
And if people are still talking about it

390
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
Then he did his job

391
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
Right

392
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
I'm fine with the criticism

393
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,399
About people thinking it's the worst thing ever because

394
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,215
It certainly is certainly says Hey and I'll

395
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
We noticed that we have an opinion about it we have a strong open

396
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
We remember it

397
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
I think that's

398
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
That's great

399
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,735
And the Raptors original plan to hook kids with the Happy Meal of NBA jersey

400
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
Love it or hate it

401
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
You could argue that it worked

402
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,367
Today Toronto has a loyal fanbase

403
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,207
Head over the past five years I've had some of the highest attendance numbers in the league

404
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,535
And as for those bold 90s jerseys

405
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
They haven't actually gone extinct

406
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
Entire company

407
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,911
Mapreduce retro jersey

408
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,495
And many of the designs, Grady and his team came up with

409
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,031
Are really popular

410
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
I want the top sellers

411
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
Its a bright purple jersey

412
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
For the jagged claw cut pinstripes

413
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
A red dinosaur

414
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
Dribbling a basketball

415
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:13,727
Because Oakland Warriors swept the finals this episode about basketball jerseys the season by Justin

It's time for the World Cup and we have the perfect design nerd World Cup conversation starter

418
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
After this

419
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
Between the beats

420
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,111
Bongs and chatter of our devices

421
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,695
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

422
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
If

423
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

424
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,215
All hearing that voice

425
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Technology

426
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
She talked to us

427
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
It is a creation of Sonic trap

428
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,127
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

429
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,711
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

430
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,759
To make them more human

431
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
Turn the living room lights on

432
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Okay

433
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,439
Dim the living room lights to 50

434
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
2%

435
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Okay

436
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:14,399
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

437
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,447
Makes for a much more natural

438
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Experience

439
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,263
Turn the living room lights on

440
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Dim the living room lights

441
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
50%

About how are soundscape is impacting our health

445
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,159
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

446
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,975
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

447
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Right here

E9pay

449
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
We need to talk about something

450
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:52,031
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating you tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet

451
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Size routine

452
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,847
Thinking about it all the time is frustrating

453
00:18:55,103 --> 00:19:00,223
It doesn't have to Define your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

Flash podcast

458
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,143
So most major sports that involve a ball

459
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
Including

460
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,471
Basketball and baseball in American football

461
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,775
They went to early periods in which

462
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
Actual ball designs buried

463
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
A whole lot

464
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,687
But in general the shapes in the materials and dimensions and the basic look

465
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,479
Have all become standardized

466
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Overtime

467
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,343
You know in the NBA you've got a big brown ball of a certain exact size

468
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
With thin black lines

469
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
Major League Baseball

470
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
A small white sphere made

471
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:48,863
With exactly one underneath double stitches are veterinarians and then in the NFL ever

472
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,495
Uses the same brown prolate spheroid white stripes

473
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
Plated

474
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,919
Very narrow pressure range of around 13 PSI in trouble

475
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Active measures

476
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
Hampton sequestered before the game

477
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:09,855
What is Kirko said I'm talking to he's our digital director and we're going to talk about a type of ball that is

478
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,463
A bit less consistent it continues to change year after year it is the socket

479
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,023
In 1930 at the first World Cup

480
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,607
The two teams competing in the final game couldn't bother you

481
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,679
Sophie's actually stepped in and had them alternator

482
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
Between two different balls

483
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,007
Using 1 teams picked for the first half

484
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,031
And the other teams picked

485
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
The second half of the game

486
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,871
Going forward FIFA rule that they are

487
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
He just one ballpark

488
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:40,319
Make census of the two balls in 1930 look pretty similar they looked on like volleyballs and pretty rough-looking and you could see

489
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
See the laces around

490
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Send it to

491
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,999
Yeah and those are pretty typical for the time and for the decades after most balls about. Follow the same

492
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,047
Basic model long strips of leather

493
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
Is together into a rough sphere

494
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,399
Most were of a single solid color to usually

495
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
Neutral Browns yellow

496
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Oranges

497
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:01,055
Stop lights bulbs and I grew up with didn't look like that it was made up of

498
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
Very uniform patch work

499
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
High contrast

500
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,151
Black and white

501
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
Geometric shape

502
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,223
A map of Europe

503
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,015
That classic soccer ball that's

504
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
Very recognizable

505
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,087
Basically iconic at this point

506
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,928
That's if you do an image search on the web for soccer ball icon

507
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,208
That's exactly what you'll find

508
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,768
So how did this become deejdesign everyone

509
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,840
Will soccer balls first started featuring this

510
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,400
Distinctive pattern of pentagons and hexagons

511
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
In the 1960s

512
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,288
Then he got really famous when fee that use a virgin made by Adidas

513
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
For the 1970 World Cup

514
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
They wanted something high contrast

515
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,456
So the gameplay would be easier for viewers at home to follow on black and white television

516
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
The so-called

517
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Telstar ball

518
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,040
Was an instant

519
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,648
The name Telstar is a portmanteau of the words television and star

520
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,720
Because it was meant to be the perfect soccer ball for televised games

521
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,792
The name was borrowed from the Telstar communication satellite

522
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,376
Which was white and spherical and had black solar panels

523
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
A lot of substance

524
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,264
Have continued to use the same basic approach of alternating darks and lights

525
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
But the designs

526
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,616
Have really evolved to over the years

527
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:12,224
Official balls went from having 32 to 14 to just eight panels or fewer and son

528
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
And this isn't just cosmetic

529
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,808
Those different number of panels

530
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
Change the function of

531
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,232
Yeah they affect the shape and how the ball performs on the field and make a really big sort of structural difference

532
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
So can you tell me about this year's ball

533
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
Yeah so this year Adidas

534
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,888
Urban Design these balls

535
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,680
Since 1970

536
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
Telstar ball

537
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,984
They're back again

538
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,312
And this time they're actually bringing back the Telstar

539
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
With the Telstar 18

540
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,664
How similar is the Telstar 18

541
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
To the original

542
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,272
So it does have black and white but this news

543
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
6 panel design

544
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,624
Actually also features a digital grid pattern of the grave

545
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
Pixels that fade between League

546
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,488
Well the original Telstar could be

547
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:59,072
