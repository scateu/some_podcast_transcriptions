This is 99% invisible

25
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
I'm Roman Mars

26
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,704
The only time you should really rob a bank

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,520
Is on a Friday afternoon

28
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,104
. they're still needed to be a way to steal something and get it out of there

29
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,408
The Guiding principles you do not want to get caught

30
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,736
When I go into a bank

31
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,064
Especially effective stand in line waiting to make a deposit

32
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,368
My mind wanders

33
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,464
One of the first places that wonder is 2 in is how I would Rob the place

34
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,584
I look at the exits and entrances the layout of the building how could it be done

35
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
Most of the time

36
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,424
Buildings are our friends

37
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,008
It's fun to recast the building as the enemy

38
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
The obstacle we have to overcome

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
I guess it's a good thing we made our last Kickstarter goal the puzzle of how to get the money

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,832
Out of the bank is one that our culture has been obsessed with for a long time

41
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:07,232
The first recorded bank robbery took place in the 1860s and basically ever since we've been sued

42
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
Seduced by the idea of ice

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
People

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,168
I do them today will meet three people who all tried in their own way to beat

45
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
The back

46
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,520
With designs that go from a spectacularly complicated

47
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,568
Did the deceptively simple

48
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
Oh and one of them

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
Actually pull that off

50
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
Several times

51
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
Iced one

52
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
Mastermind

53
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Los Angeles

54
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,048
So I'm alone agena number designer noticed I'm based in London my work

55
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,864
Relates to the idea that design could be a plot

56
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,168
And I think while I'm fascinated

57
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
Bye

58
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:53,824
Is a fact that it never has to happen so you have absolute freedom to find size about whatever you want

59
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,896
And with this in mind Gainer set out to make her Heist

60
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
Is big and calm

61
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Cheated as

62
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
A sort of go-big-or-go-home style

63
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
And she was interested in the interplay

64
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
Hollywood movies about heists

65
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
In real life

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
This is really weird feedback loops that happened in Hollywood Hollywood being the intrinsic pool on everything

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
Thing that relates

68
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,144
To the iconography of a heist

69
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
So of course her highest had to take

70
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
Cake place in LA

71
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,824
There were years mostly in the 70s 80s and 90s

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,664
When La was accurately dubs the bank robbery capital

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
The world

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,504
A particularly bad years there were as many as

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
2600 bank robbery

76
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,648
That's roughly one robbery every 45 minutes

77
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
I've been working

78
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,488
People of conjecture about why this is

79
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
Inner thinks it may be the pull of Hollywood

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
Or the physical layout

81
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Ballet

82
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,704
Is constructed due to the opposite of the highways

83
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,264
It's actually very easy to get away

84
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,848
As long as you're not trying to get away during rush hour

85
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,968
To be fair to La their bank robbery stats are way less jaw-dropping now

86
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,600
According to the FBI there were only 212 reported bank robberies in 2013

87
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
But let's get to gainers

88
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,232
Chapter one school the distraction at one Wilshire

89
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:21,631
Panoramic Kickstarter last year to fund her work this is from the video

90
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:28,031
Plane takes off from Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday morning at precisely 9:46 a.m.

91
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
It's assignment to deliver a full-scale replica of a 747 commercial jet to a fill

92
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
Somerset

93
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,551
Lost flying over downtown LA the cables holding the replica snap

94
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
Dropping the plane 10000 ft

95
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,415
Crashing into the government building one Wilshire

96
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:51,327
One Wilshire is a 28 story building in Downtown LA most of it is filled with computer servers in Telecommunications

97
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:57,727
Equipment is the goal of is to draw crowds of pulses buying preoccupied police from what's real

98
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
Really going on

99
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:04,127
And what's really going on is that wall every emergency responder in La is busy with

100
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,431
The destruction at one Wilshire

101
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,271
5 different banks in the surrounding area are being robbed

102
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
Beginners plan involves stealing the actual safe

103
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,951
Because that's where the big money is

104
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,351
It's become La loan now that they're only allowed to hold $2,000 at 1 so if they there

105
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
For example there were 10 total

106
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:33,055
Behind each cubicle you need 10 people in the OD amount that you ever get is a is a limit of $2,000 in

107
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
Each of those cubicles

108
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,687
Gaynor's plan was to drill large concentric circles

109
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
Into the bags

110
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
Fallout the vault

111
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,647
And then load them on a truck we could call circles that get smaller in size as you reach the vault

112
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,439
Anasazi pool

113
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,839
Pull the goods backwards it rips the building and pause so that the building could collapse on its own weight after you

114
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,959
Leaving no traces or trying to diminish the amount of evidence possible

115
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:06,847
Gaynor did a ton of research trying to figure out the size of the vaults the layout of the building

116
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:11,967
She was working with a group of students from the Art Center College of design in LA

117
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,295
And we have them ask questions in the buildings

118
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,647
Kind of playfully where architecture students who want to find out

119
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,231
Powerful How deep the building goes and so on

120
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,047
As of now she knows the sizes of all the vaults

121
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:32,191
But one V one was still trying to work out weave Comfort to the cleaner that has worked in one of the bank

122
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,287
Entering the Vault tolls is very difficult

123
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
Not all of the research

124
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Has been

125
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
Like watching Lots

126
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
And lots

127
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,343
The only thing the one you want to have insane ironically is Inside Man and people keep telling me to watch it and I keep

128
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Meaning to

129
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,695
And it's one I'd like to save up because I'm told it's very good

130
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
Mastermind Russell to work

131
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Location New York City

132
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,631
New York

133
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,959
Hello my name is Russell gewirtz on the right or the

134
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
Inside Man

135
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,055
Starring Jodie Foster Clive Owen and Denzel Washington

136
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,895
In the early 2000s gewirtz was living in New York City

137
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,735
He wasn't a screenwriter he had nothing to do with Hollywood

138
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
I hadn't

139
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
Going to film school I hadn't

140
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,855
Read a book on screenwriting or anything

141
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,975
He was just a guy working in real estate that like me and apparently a lot of other people

142
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,047
Like thinking about the best way to rob a bank

143
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
Part of my daily commute

144
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,399
Was that I walk for my Apartments my car a few blocks

145
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
Walk past an empty bank

146
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,263
Every day when I was walking past this bank that's what we're talking

147
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
My head so it was sort of like this

148
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:47,967
It was just a few minutes of my day every morning and every evening where I would end up

149
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,551
Working on this snow soda fantasizing about this story in my mind

150
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,135
In fact for about 3 Years chords constructed the

151
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Heist in his mind

152
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
Before he ever wrote down a word

153
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
For most of that time I don't think I ever really intended

154
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
To write a movie

155
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
It was just

156
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
You know just

157
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
The date

158
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,215
He knew he wanted his house to take place in Manhattan

159
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
But it took him awhile to

160
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
To figure out what kind of Bank

161
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
It would be

162
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
You think about it

163
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
The story

164
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Is

165
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Dependent upon me

166
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
The architecture ever if you will or this

167
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,343
Structure as I was writing it I had to have a sense of

168
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
Okay is this a modern banquette

169
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Glasgow

170
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Going to come see everything

171
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
What's going on or is it old

172
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
Just have smaller Windows into me

173
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,815
You know sometimes we know can I only see a little

174
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,887
Because that was going to determine how you know a lot of the action

175
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
In the film

176
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
So the fun of it the great part is that

177
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,311
As I'm writing it I really get to build the bank however I want it to be

178
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:50,687
The bank that gorgeous in that building cuz they classic old one high ceilings marble floors

179
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:57,087
Elegant and uncomfortable in a way that big city banks used to be and it has no windows in front of the police

180
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,951
He's a very little idea about what's going on inside with all the bank robbers and hostages

181
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:07,071
CBS 2 News outside Manhattan Trust Bank where we have just been told by investigators

182
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,119
The bank has been robbed

183
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:14,239
An okay spoiler alerts ahead but the house that he designs is really clever

184
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
A group of masked robbers

185
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,895
Enters the bank and takes everyone all of the customers and all the bank employees hostage

186
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,807
Everybody that the robbers make all of the hostages take off their

187
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
Clothes and put on the same outfit

188
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
Update Robert

189
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Are also wearing

190
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
I kind of blue jumpsuit

191
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Like a painter would wear

192
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,327
I need all of you to put on one of these suits

193
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Chinese mask

194
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
So you can't tell

195
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
Who's the hostage

196
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
The robber

197
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,007
Even the hostages lose track of Who's Who

198
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
Toward the end of the movie

199
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,615
The hostages and robbers all come out with their hands up

200
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,431
But because they're dressed exactly the same

201
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
The police have no idea

202
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
Who was the hostage

203
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Who were the robber

204
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,367
They questioned everyone but they still can't figure it out

205
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,927
And eventually they have to let them all go

206
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Anna Bruen

207
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,255
But there was still one problem

208
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,303
It became clear to me that

209
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,887
As clever as it was to tie them in a dress themselves up like the hostages

210
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,727
They're they're still needed to be a way to steal something and get it out of

211
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
You know I couldn't I couldn't sneak it out

212
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
Indiana with the house

213
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Messages

214
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
So

215
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,687
In the end I decided one of them had to stay behind

216
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
And

217
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:33,343
From there it became well if he stays behind he's got he has to be hiding and if he's going to be hiding

218
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,183
It's got to be really clever and it has to be something that is hinted at

219
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,511
Throughout the entire movie while the robbers are in the back

220
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
They're doing something in the back room

221
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Building something

222
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
Digging something

223
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
It's unclear what's going on

224
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,727
You think that maybe they're digging a tunnel

225
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
But they're actually building is a room a tiny cell with a false wall hidden behind some shelves

226
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
In the basement

227
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
At the bank

228
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
They use the building itself

229
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
As an unwitting accomplice

230
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,647
One of the robbers the one who actually has the stolen goods

231
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,207
Has to stay behind until all the police are gone

232
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,023
Until they're done Gathering evidence at the bank

233
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,583
He has to stay in this little room

234
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
Burn entire week

235
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
You know it's it's

236
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,215
It's funny it's hard for me to know exactly how much

237
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
My intention actually

238
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
True but when they're

239
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,079
When they're hacking through the concrete floor

240
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,895
They're building a toilet

241
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,711
Because of your hiding in a tiny cell for a week

242
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
Well you're going to have to go

243
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Somewhere

244
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
And that's the thing about this high

245
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
It feels pretty believable

246
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
There no black box

247
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,719
And you know if you're watching a movie

248
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,279
And a bunch of crooks get to the unit get to the safe

249
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,911
Somebody just pulled out a piece of equipment from the backpack and sticks it on the lock and the villain a lock open

250
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
It's called the black box

251
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
Those don't exist in the real world they only exist

252
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:02,175
But even without black boxes a highly orchestrated highest with multiple players and lots of moving Parts like the

253
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
1 in Inside Man

254
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
Is really different

255
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,575
From the reality of how most bank robberies take place

256
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
According to the FBI's own status

257
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
Sex most Bank

258
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,487
Properties are done by just a single person

259
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
Who presents a note to the teller

260
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
And walks out

261
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Without a lot of fur

262
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,167
Which is a fundamental principle of design

263
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,983
If you want something to work and work well

264
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Keep it

265
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Symbol

266
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Mastermind

267
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
Tom Justice

268
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Location

269
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
California

270
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
Illinois

271
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:42,879
So all of the other people I'm I'm talking to you for the show

272
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
Designs

273
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
Bank robberies or bank heist

274
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,351
Kind of a creative exercise but that's not the case with you

275
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,911
Now that's correct

276
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:00,287
I have unfortunately been convicted of 26 bank robberies in three different states

277
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,871
A my case they called me the choir boy robber

278
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:10,527
The FBI gave him the same because during the robberies he would stand with his hands folded on the counter and his

279
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Head bowed

280
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
When I can't see someone's hands

281
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,391
That makes me very nervous

282
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,231
So in order to serve make myself calm and

283
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
Bank teller calm

284
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
Your hands full but nicely

285
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
Put them right there but everybody IDs

286
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
Tom always worked alone

287
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
And he always used a note

288
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
The noise

289
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
This is a bank robbery

290
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
Put all your money in the bag

291
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,639
Thank you and you have to be prepared

292
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
The teller to think the note is a joke

293
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,271
It's interesting it breaks your stride a little bit because

294
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
You should have in this Zone

295
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
And then the teller

296
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
She looks at me like

297
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Are you serious

298
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Yes serious

299
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
Because if you've never experienced his butt

300
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
Before and who has

301
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
You think it's

302
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
You think it's a joke

303
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
And like Alone Again

304
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
The artist that we are

305
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Heard from earlier

306
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Tom Davis

307
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Is research

308
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Especially at the

309
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Probably took

310
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
3-4 months of

311
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,895
Over Surge and a lot of observation

312
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,943
The Guiding principles you do not want to get caught

313
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
And as such

314
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
You want to sort of

315
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,319
Envision all sorts of different scenarios

316
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
Someone might engage you in the bank

317
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
A bank employee

318
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
A bank

319
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Customer

320
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
What will you do

321
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,327
When you if you reach an altercation what is your Escape Route

322
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
Is it might be different from your

323
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
Sandrock

324
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
Everything has to be highly thought out

325
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,751
Tom getaway vehicle was his bicycle

326
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,591
So the first thing you do is figure out where he was going to leave the bike park

327
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,895
Well I was inside robbing the bank

328
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
From there

329
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
I actually

330
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
Physically

331
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,783
Walked through in terms of the steps

332
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
I'll actually count the steps

333
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
I would count the moves

334
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
I would practice

335
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
Literally

336
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
Hundreds of times

337
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
A small notebook

338
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,375
And which I wrote on every single

339
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,703
Would you leave Footprints police patterns

340
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
Possibilities

341
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
High pedestrian traffic areas

342
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
Come spend a lot of time observing people

343
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,663
Patterns and completely unintuitively

344
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
Came to believe

345
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,991
Banks closest to

346
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Popsations

347
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
Make for the softest Target

348
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:25,183
Tom thinks this is because when cops go out on duty they tend to drive out a ways

349
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,207
The station

350
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,511
Which means it takes them longer to get to the

351
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
He never called back

352
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
Robbery

353
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,143
Any tended to rob banks in Middle to upper-class neighborhoods

354
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
So that it would look at

355
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,239
Black with support somebody

356
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,335
Riding away on a bicycle if you were in it to be in a really tough area

357
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
I really working class area

358
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,175
That would stand out

359
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
No I did not lock up my bike

360
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
Honestly I was only away from

361
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
That site

362
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
223 minutes

363
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,951
Over the course of four years Tom stole close to $130,000

364
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,767
Plus about $5,000 for robbery

365
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
He never used the gun

366
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
And no one was ever physically hurt

367
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,167
For the end of his bank-robbing career Tom got careless

368
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,983
Stop putting as much time in planning

369
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
Did all of the standard steps of

370
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,127
What is the Escape Route what is the alternate Escape Route

371
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
But I did not really

372
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
Pay attention to like

373
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,527
Police and I will hang out and watch police patterns

374
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
I just got a cocky

375
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,135
Tom Justice was eventually caught and spent nine years

376
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
In prison

377
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,463
Design matters

378
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
You want to know what else matters

379
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
What

380
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Cheat

381
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:43,263
We want our know what we have in the bank money not your money your money is insured by the federal government not going to lose a dime

382
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,567
The 1995 movie

383
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,615
Heat from director Michael Mann

384
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,687
Set in La of course it influenced

385
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
All three of our Heist masterminds

386
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,879
I kind of a scene

387
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,999
Lots over the years my favorite being Heats Michael Mann's Heat

388
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
In prison

389
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,095
Heat is the number one movie

390
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Amongst convicts

391
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
Whenever say we're all

392
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
Hanging out on a Saturday in heat comes on

393
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,543
TNT and it's on that at all time

394
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
Whatever it is you're doing

395
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
You you should have sat down

396
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
I'm going to watch at least an hour of

397
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
Craft projects

398
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
Jenkins

399
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
You put it all aside

400
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Repeat

401
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:32,671
And the heist designers in our story aren't the only ones influence by heat

402
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,511
There was a real heist in LA in 1997.

403
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,303
The North Hollywood shootout

404
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
You can actually watch and listen

405
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:46,751
Parts of it online

406
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,711
It's a robbery on a Bank of America gone awry

407
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,295
And it all unfolds in a way that is suspiciously similar

408
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
To the plot

409
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,415
That's really weird feedback loops that happened in Hollywood

410
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,487
It seems when it comes the heist

411
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
Life often imitates art

412
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:14,655
And all these plans are only good at Art I cannot stress this enough people crime doesn't pay

413
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,215
Baby must embark on a life of crime

414
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,615
Don't let yourself get attached to anything you're not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat

415
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,919
If you feel the heat around the corner

416
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,663
99% invisible was Bruce's sweet by Katie mingle with Sam Greenspan Avery trufelman and me Roman Mars

417
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:04,319
We are project of 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco and produced are the offices of Arc

418
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,671

419
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207

420
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
Wall of in

421
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,047
Thick lucite between you and the tellers

422
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
So you ain't getting in there

423
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
Don't even think about

424
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,751
Between the beats

425
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,055
Bongs and Charter of our devices

426
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
We're immersed

427
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,383
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

428
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,015
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

429
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:39,903
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remembrall hearing that voice

430
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Technology

431
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
You talk to us

432
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,999
It is a creation of Sonic trash

433
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,071
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

434
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,655
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

435
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
To make them more human

436
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
Turn the living room lights on

437
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Okay

438
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
Dim the living room lights

439
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
50%

440
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Okay

441
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:09,087
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

442
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,903
Makes for a much more natural experience

443
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
Turn the living room lights on

444
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
Dim the living room lights to 50

445
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
80%

446
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:26,751
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

447
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,103

Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

454
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:49,279
You tell yourself it's not that bad to take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is

455
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:55,679
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

469
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,600
A five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

470
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
The body genius is a dark

471
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
Comic mystery

472
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
That whines through a

473
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,488
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

474
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,024
We're looking the part

475
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Might cost you your life

476
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,936
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

477
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,288
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

478
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,872
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

479
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
A dad

480
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,992
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

481
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296
Actually if I'm being honest

482
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

483
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,024
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

484
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,352
Was found dead in my private gym

485
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,680
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

486
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:36,032
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

487
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
Now

488
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,104
I need to clear my name

489
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,456
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do
