I'm Roman Mars

33
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:34,464
Around the corner from our office in beautiful Downtown Oakland California is delauer's news

34
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:40,608
It is been there since 1907 for the people who live and work downtown it is Central to our existence

35
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,424
Everyone goes there to buy drinks

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,472
Lottery tickets little packs

37
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,544
Fruit flavored cigarillos and occasionally

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
Even a newspaper

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
163

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,528
But about eight months ago it became clear that even though delauer's wants a bunch of people inside the store buying things

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,624
They don't want a bunch of people outside their store hanging out on the sidewalk

42
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
Here's how you can tell

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,864
Delauer started playing really loud classical music

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,144
Speaker outside

45
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,728
And although I still see a fair number of people hanging out in front of them

46
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
The owner says

47
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
It's not nearly as many

48
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592

49
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,664
Who was Master Hung go outside and you know just

50
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,272
They playing dice on the street outside the door and it was crazy

00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624

I'm the owner of the larceny 6th and my name is fuzzy llama

54
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
When you have classical music

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,352
People who are young and cool don't really hang out there

56
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
So that's a way

57
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
That is selling the seven

Unpleasant design

62
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:57,408
Playing classical music on loudspeakers is an example of what selling a call

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
Unpleasant design

64
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,784
Unpleasant design is something that works well at deterring

65
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,600
Certain behaviors in certain uses

66
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,184
From a particular public spaces

67
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,744
Along with her partner Gordon the Savages

Selena collects and catalogs unpleasant designs

69
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
Unpleasant design was

70
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,656
Pure since we started designing puppy

71
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,424
6 pesos

72
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
Cities unpleasant designs are mentally start a kind of social control in public by targeting people who spend a lot

73
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
Taco Time in public spaces

74
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Especially the Young

75
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
And the homeless

76
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:37,088
And the designs often end up pushing the so-called undesirable people out of one's face

77
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
And into another

78
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
Music is only one method

00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000

Teens from public space

81
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,120
In 2009 the Nottinghamshire housing Estates in England in

82
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
Pink lighting

83
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
To keep kids from congregating

84
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Pink lights

85
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Witchwood

86
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
Emphasized

87
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,336
The skin like blemishes and on teenagers

88
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Which should

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Results

90
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
In teenagers not hanging out there

91
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
That's one of my favorite

92
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,296
Mine too although there's not a lot of evidence that proves how

93
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Effective it is

94
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,672
Pink lighting that preys on teenagers insecurities he's funny

95
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
And kind of devious if

96
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
A little far-fetched

97
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:21,375
Another more substantiated example of targeting in trying to eliminate undesirable Behavior with light

98
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
Is the presence of blue Lighting in public restroom

99
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,031
I saw this in UK train stations quite a bit last time I was there

100
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
Blue light up

101
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
The particular color makes

102
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
Davines

103
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
Slightly less visible

104
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,735
You can't see your veins Through Your Skin So it's hard to find

105
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
The target if you're an intravenous drug use

106
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
Then it became a very popular solution

107
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
Transfer all kind of publicly excessive

108
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Toto Toilets

109
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
And even sometimes in buses

110
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
When your veins are

111
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,023
Not visible to you you're obviously not going to be able to

112
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
Taken herring

113
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,399
According to selinunte lights are one of the original forms of public social control

114
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
For example

115
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
There was a bridge in a small

116
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,823
Town in Bosnia specifically in the kasbah of Visa grad Bosnia

117
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
In the early 1900s

118
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
Where the Austrian government

119
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
Kind of annex

120
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
The country

121
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:13,343
At the time decided to implement Street lighting and that was very unpleasant to the

122
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Locals in the locals with

123
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Destroy the light

124
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Every night

125
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
And the government

126
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
Reinstall it every morning

127
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,071
Intermedia that lied to something unpleasant

128
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Work

129
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Free

130
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
Expression in public space

131
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
Is something to be

132
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Completely forgot

133
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,311
We've since become so habituated to public lighting that are primary experience

134
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Street lights

135
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,407
Is that deter criminal activity and make us feel safe

136
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,295
Unless you're someone who laments the lack of stars in the night sky or live in an apartment with a window right next to

137
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
Premier League brake bulb

138
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,415
You might never View street lights as unpleasant at all

139
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,279
Which is one of the reasons why the unpleasant design project wants to point it out

140
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
So that it gets recognized

141
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
Isis being part

142
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
Of an overall design scheme

143
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,215
They can take on a much uglier manifestation

144
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,031
Woody's studs Miami be a few centimes

145
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
Cool but I've caused a big debate

146
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
This is from a BBC news story from 2014 the reporter Nick Beek is pointing to a set of angry

147
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,551
Looking spikes that were installed in the concrete

148
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,647
Floor of a small Alcove by the entrance to an apartment building

149
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,487
The spikes are clearly meant to stop people from sitting or lying

150
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,327
Is this a legitimate way to prevent rough sleeping and possible answer

151
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
Sexual behavior

152
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,423
Rob a symbol of a heartless approach

153
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
H one of the answer

154
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
That spiked a huge debate and the

155
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,455
Even the mayor of London reacted and said that they should be removed and that the

156
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
We should not have a dress

157
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
Let's keep on this way

158
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,623
The grocery chain Tesco also at its bikes to areas outside the intro

159
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,927
Thanks to one of its stores in central London into

160
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:58,559
They were removed after days of public protests

161
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
The way we

162
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,399
Treat homelessness and is that something that we just

163
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
I want to remove from apus

164
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Space

165
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
Or is it something that we should

166
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
Summer structurally

167
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Address

168
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:13,663
Spikes to stop people from sitting or lying down evoked a wide variety of reactions from the public

169
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
The first time I saw someone lying here

170
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
Homeless couple actually

171
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
I didn't like it

172
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Because

173
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
Buy them

174
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
So when I saw those.

175
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
I thought good idea

176
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,047
A lot of people are bothered by the presence of homeless people

177
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,631
But some are also alarmed by just how aggressive the spikes are

178
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
It's almost

179
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
Looks harmful

180
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,239
You know if you lie I know what you're gonna get spiked

181
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,079
So it sends a message which I think is wrong

182
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,151
It's worth saying that these fights are not just in England

183
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
We have them in the US to

184
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
Outside of our office is a window ledge

185
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,807
That's where you naturally want to say and sure enough

186
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
Beverly's black metal door knob looking things

187
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,415
I keep anyone from rusting there

188
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,255
And one thing that makes me spikes and similar features especially frustrating

189
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
Is that they're just there

190
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
They're not moving

191
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
There's no arguing with

192
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,655
Mac have a policeman who prohibit

193
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
People from sleeping

194
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
Interpark

195
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,775
I think there is still some possible negotiation

196
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
And I think that's

197
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Good that's what Society is about

198
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
The ongoing negotiation

199
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
And ongoing change

200
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
But when we start

201
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
Using things that are immutable and

202
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
Unchangeable like

203
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,623
Metal spikes there is nothing that is going to

204
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
How to change until they rot

205
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,695
I think that's the most important

206
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
Criteria

207
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
The calling some

208
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
Unpleasant

209
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
The design

210
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
It is something that you cannot

211
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Negotiate with

212
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,191
We have all tried and probably failed to negotiate

213
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,543
With one of the most common and aggravating forms of unpleasant design

214
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
Public seating

215
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Weather Winter Park

216
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,151
Or the bus stop or an airport

217
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,431
There are countless ways

218
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,735
There's have made it so you cannot get comfortable

219
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
And most especially

220
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
Cannot lie down

221
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,647
A classic is the bench with armrest in between

222
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Which

223
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
Corselet to you

224
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
Rest your arm on

225
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,535
On the arm rest but at the same time

226
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
They restrict

227
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Any

228
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
Other kind of use

229
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
Then sitting up

230
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Right

231
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,983
The only way to spend can be used as spy

232
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
3 people sitting next to

233
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
Teach other not looking

234
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
Which is not

235
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
The only thing you

236
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Can do it on a bench

237
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
Especially it's not the owner

238
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
Normal and legal things

239
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Events

240
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
Cylinder things that limiting the ways something can be used

241
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
Is problematic

242
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
By attacking or addressing one

243
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
Particular problem

244
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,487
You actually generate Money More Problems and reduce complexity

245
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
50 year old Behavior

246
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
Public space

247
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,351
It's not just the biters and arm rash

248
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,959
Any unpleasant design book they also point out benches that are mounted so high that

249
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
Your feet can't touch

250
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Touch the ground

251
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
And therefore they're uncomfortable

252
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
Hunter short period of time

253
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
Any document in increased prevalence

254
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Leanings

255
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Bus stops

256
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,991
You can rest against while standing but they do not accommodate

257
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
Sitting or sleeping

258
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,111
But the object that's so not considers the masterpiece

259
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
Unpleasant design

260
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
Is the Camden bench

261
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Basically it is

262
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
A design Solutions

263
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
222 I think

264
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
Antisocial behavior problems

265
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
The only thing

266
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
It does not

267
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
Datura sitting

268
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,543
The Camden bench so named because it was commissioned by Camden London Borough Council

269
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
Is a streams

270
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
Angular

271
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Sculpted

272
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
Solid lump of concrete

273
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,711
With rounded edges and slope

274
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
Unexpected place

275
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,087
Critikon medium named Frank Swain called at the perfect

276
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Antibiotic

277
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:40,767
Anti sleeping because of shape makes it uncomfortable to sleep on anti drug dealing because there are no slots are crevasses in Wichita

278
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:47,167
Hydra anti-theft because the recess is near the ground allow people to store bags behind their legs and away from would be

279
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:53,567
The criminal anti skateboard because the edges on the bench fluctuating height making grinding difficult because

280
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
No services are crevasses

281
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,455
Or literal can accrue anti-graffiti because it has a special coating to repel paint

282
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,527
And all those goals are pretty noble

283
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
Except for sleeping in skateboard

284
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,415
I don't really want the other activities happening in public spaces I go to either

285
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
But someone that's of itsfunneh's this Litany of antimatter

286
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Demoralizing

287
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,839
It discourages 22 things it encourages to

288
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
Sitting and sitting together

289
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
When we expect

290
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,191
People to do bad things to the bench

291
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
Before we think of

292
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Anything good

293
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
People wouldn't might do it

294
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
To dispense

295
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
I think that's a very

296
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
Sad approach

297
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
Public space

298
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,271
It's also a contagious approach to public space

299
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,927
Is a chapter in the unpleasant design book this devoted to all the unpleasant designs used to thwart pigeons and cities

300
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
Anti pigeon spikes

301
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
Nets are everywhere

302
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,815
And even if your likes Elena and I wear of these measures

303
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,119
Skeptical of our war on pigeons

304
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
You might not have a choice in whether or not to use them

305
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
A week after we have

306
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
Publish the book

307
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
We had a confirmation of this

308
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,871
We didn't even notice but on the balcony doors

309
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
We actually had empty pigeon

310
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Spikes

311
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
And then

312
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,295
Do to somebody hanging out on the balcony with

313
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
I don't know

314
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Clumsy

315
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
And and they destroyed

316
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Spikes on one side

317
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
And we

318
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Didn't even notice that

319
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
Send me the balcony with

320
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
With pigeons

321
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,167
Pigeons might not be overwhelming if the population is spread throughout a city

322
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
Cody of pigeons by

323
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,543
Wax concentrate pigeons in the few places where there are no spies

324
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,383
Selena argues that's when the problem is created

325
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
And that should not be the weight

326
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Solve any kind of

327
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
Interest conflict

328
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
/ a

329
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
Space but yes

330
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,599
We will immediately fix star Spike

331
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
There is always an aspect of

332
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
According to design

333
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,327
Design is used to get you to buy things

334
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
Use your iPhone a certain way

335
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,167
Sometimes without you even being aware of

336
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,007
And these pieces of hostile and unpleasant architecture are no

337
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Design is something that

338
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,591
Is supposed to transmit a setting

339
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Use

340
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
This object

341
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Otherwise

342
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
It would have not been

343
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Designed

344
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
However

345
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,527
I think it is very problematic when we started

346
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
People by Design

347
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
The reason we need a critical theory of unpleasant design is so we can recognize the cores in this taking place in our public space

348
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,607
We need to know when replacing human interaction and nuance and empathy

349
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
With hard

350
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Physical

351
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
Non-negotiable Solutions

352
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
And this is what we wanted to

353
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Achieve with this book

354
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
Start the debate

355
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,359
There will always be people who believe

356
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
Is it good weighing people

357
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
Well thank you terrible

358
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,759
And we have some extreme in our opinion we really The Observers

359
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,063
And now you're an observer 2

360
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,647
Whether you think a certain form of design is exclusionary but

361
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Serve the greater good

362
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Or just

363
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
Hostile and offensive

364
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,303
It's important to be aware of the decisions that are being made for

365
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
Because most likely

366
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,679
Unpleasant design is put there to make things more pleasant

367
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471

Great melodium into your daily routine
