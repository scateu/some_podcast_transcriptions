I'm Roman Mars

31
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,672
Is a well-known literary technique called chekhov's gun

32
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
Mater the Russian playwright

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,024
Basically a gun appears in the First Act

34
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:41,888
It better be fired in the following act there are no unnecessary detail

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
If you're gone

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
That gun gets used to shoot

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,360
I have a corollary principle of my own invention and relates to movies where there is a scene at a construction

38
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
And it is this

39
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:58,784
If on the screen you see an ugly shaft of exposed rebar

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,112
Somebody is getting impaled

41
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
There's something about rebar

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,352
If nothing else because there are very few things that invoke a fear of being skewered

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,264
Like pathological preoccupation with metal reinforcement bars dovetails nicely with a structure in San Francisco

44
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
Kind of become obsessed

45
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Tiny Bridge

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
In Golden Gate Park

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,224
This is the Alford Lake bridge by Ernest Ransom

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,624
This is when lemon he teaches architecture at the California College of the Arts and he was the first person to tip me off to the importance

49
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
Of this humble little structure

50
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,024
On the very Eastern edge of the park the entrance to the park

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,584
From the hate side from the kind of

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Hippie slacker

53
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Haight area

54
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
Right at the edge of the park

55
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
Turtle eating into the children's playground

56
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,312
It's not a place that most people really want to linger

57
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,384
What is a spot for drug dealing in

58
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
Various

59
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,200
Still listen to assination

60
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,576
And that is Robert Corlin author of concrete Planet giving us a lay of the land in the

61

Albert

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
Lakebridge

63
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,208
One of the earliest surviving reinforced concrete structure

64
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
Pictures in the world

65
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,048
The bridge was constructed in 1889

66
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
It may be the least appealing sort of Monument above of architecture civil engineering

67
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,520
Inside of crack with a birth certificate wrestling through its

68
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
Covered in mold and lichen

69
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
Inside it's a

70
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,688
Surrealistic tunnel of

71
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
Stalactites that

72
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
Really

73
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,552
Going to look like some sort of folk art

74
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,952
No impression of what the surface of Mars might look like he looks like the inside of a giant colon

75
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Unappealing

76
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,000
The pass through it

77
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:49,376
I'm it's not well kept up at all well there's nothing remarkable about it is an arch

78
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,960
It's actually as much a pedestrian tunnel was a bridge

79
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,288
Pioneering structure in the shape of a dumpy in the

80
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
Neglected little Bridge

81
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
But that's really sad because it is

82
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,480
One of the pioneering buildings in the story of reinforced concrete

83
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
There are plenty of candidates for the most overlooked most visible part of the

84
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,303
Has a good claim to being the most invisible of all

85
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,911
Because if it's made right you never see the steel skeleton underneath

86
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,703
All the concrete structures that

87
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,103
Work and drive over walk under reinforced concrete is concrete that is strengthened by the

88
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,175
Mission of initially iron and then later

89
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Steel

90
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
To give it tensile

91
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,039
The thing about concrete is it graded compression meaning

92
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087
Withstand a lot of pressure in terms of

93
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
Wait

94
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:47,743
But it's not very good intention meaning when you put expanding long distances assertive can collapse

95
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,351
So if you see concrete going high in the air or spanning a long distance

96
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
There is metal inside

97
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,007
And you have this unassuming Vanguard of a bridge and its engineer Ernest rants

98
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
To thank for that

99
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:05,919
Ernst ransoms the principal claim to fame is that he's the father of modern reinforced concrete

100
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,735
The experiments done with

101
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,599
Reinforcing concrete with iron previous Terrence ransomware just one office

102
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
Experiments a cottage in England

103
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,975
House in New York and Daya rowboat in France

104
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,303
Ernst Ransom experimented with

105
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,119
Different forms of iron reinforcement until

106
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,935
Hit Upon what we now call rebar which is

107
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
Too short for reinforcement bar

108
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,591
And his technology was Far Beyond any of the others

109
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,919
Who are experimenting with reinforced concrete at the time

110
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
A lot of people in Europe and America are playing with

111
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,367
Putting in bars or are metal into concrete at this time

112
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,183
There's many different techniques and everyone's experimenting

113
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
Ransom's

114
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,047
To the major Innovation is he takes the square bar

115
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,119
Any Twisted slightly

116
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
And that gives us an adhesive quality

117
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
Choota concrete Excel

118
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
Interstate together much better

119
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
Ransom

120
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
Said to come to this idea he found a twisted rubber band in his pocket one day and thought well that's what I'm going to do to this iron

121
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
Twisted

122
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
Search of spines of The Conch

123
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Better

124
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,111
You can see a diagram of this Twisted rebar and ransoms 1884 patent

125
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,183
By the way if you're anything like me Google Patent Search

126
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,767
Which is the best way to spend time in front of the computer

127
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
I can lose hours

128
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
Jumping for patent

129
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Anyway

130
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,471
This innovation of messing with the bar to help it bond with the surrounding concrete

131
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
Is still used to this day

132
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
We put

133
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,335
Formations on the reinforcing

134
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
So the concrete will

135
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,223
Hold on to it that's going is probably why I find Rebar

136
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
So ugly and on satellite

137
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,831
That's about right there right there

138
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
Show the concrete reinforcing

139
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
I called this cersi

140
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,279
The full scope of what reinforced concrete means

141
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Adult World

142
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,143
Over exaggerating I would save it to the

143
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,215
The significance of a reinforced concrete is that modern

144
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
Society is not

145
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:12,127
Well is humble is the Alvord Lake bridge is

146
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
It is a direct

147
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Precursor

148
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,759
To the Engel skyscraper

149
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
Built just

150
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:23,647
15 years later and Cincinnati Ohio the world's first reinforced concrete

151
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
Skyscraper

152
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
It also led to Bridges

153
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Dams

154
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Freeways

155
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
Streets

156
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,911
Of reinforced concrete reinforced concrete

157
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:41,567
You would only be able to build a series of unconnected asphalt roads it's a very humble beginning but

158
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,407
It was from here in San Francisco that the reinforced concrete Revolution

159
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
Take over the world

160
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,271
That's why we talked about it being the foundation of civilization

161
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,343
It's also a foundation of modern architecture

162
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,183
It made possible forms that were never possible before

163
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
Like Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum

164
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,839
And more recently and Jeanne gang Aqua Tower in Chicago

165
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,655
Mimic flowing water on the knee

166
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
Floors

167
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
There are no two floors of the

168
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
There's no truth

169
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
But the problem with reinforced concrete

170
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,151
Great especially if the rebar isn't covered with enough concrete and is it

171
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
Exposed to water and salt

172
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
Is that the steel inside

173
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
Can Ross

174
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
And as it rusts it expands

175
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,975
The expanse almost fourfold its original diameter destroying the concrete around it while

176
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Blue steel itself

177
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
Is being destroyed by the rust

178
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Corrosion

179
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
And when that happens which it will eventually

180
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:41,983
Reinforced concrete doesn't last the 1,000 years that aren't as Ransom in the early reinforced on

181
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
Opponents.

182
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,103
For many many years design life is about 50

183
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407

Structure that was put up in the middle of the 20th century in the US

200
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
People have to realize it

201
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,367
All this that they see around them will eventually have to be

202
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
With a few exceptions

203
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,231

00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,423
Unbelievable amount of money

207
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Seriously

208
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
The stuff that wasn't properly maintained

209
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
Is coming down

210
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
And as you can imagine

211
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
A lot of our infrastructure

212
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663

Even though concrete has the illusion of permanence is not that way at all

222
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
You just don't forget it

223
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
You have to

224
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
You have to account for going back

225
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
Taking care of it like you would any

00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
But in it

231
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,119
You can detect a tinge of bitterness and ransoms words

He left for the east

238
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,407
Thinking that his revolution of reinforced concrete

239
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,967
Would have a better chance out there

240
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:04,063
He left thinking that no one here would fully appreciate

Looking at it today

246
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
Sad

247
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
