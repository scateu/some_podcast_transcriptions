All add up into a story of his own journey and it starts when he was a boy

31
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
I grew up

32
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
Bungalow-style house

33
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,168
In Buffalo New York

34
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
There was

35
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,544
Beautiful radio in the kitchen

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
Was always on

37
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,944
1959 when I was two and a half

38
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
I began listening

39
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
My favorite station is WKBW

40
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
It was a top

41
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
40 station

42
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
So there were three or four commercials

43
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
It's been a free song

44
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
Listening as intensely

45
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
Yes I did

46
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,080
Soon discovered that all radio commercials worth

47
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
They were like pasta

48
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
I came in different shapes

49
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,760
There were monologue commercials

50
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,808
Dialog commercials

51
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
Interview commercials

52
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
Musical commercials

53
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:45,024
Are you into my tiny tender ears

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
I noticed all commercials had one thing in common

55
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
A certain lack of authenticity

56
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,008
The radio voices spoke with a cherry make-believe tone

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
One that said

58
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,872
Everything's great

59
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,920
This was a tone

60
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,224
I have never heard real people speak in

61
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,272
Except for one of our neighbors

62
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Mrs. Cunningham

63
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
What's an optimist

64
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
But then one day

65
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
Least expected

66
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,536
I heard a radio commercial that featured a little girl

67
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Marsha

68
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,399
What's your opinion of all the vitamins and minerals in moscow

69
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
I never showed them

70
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,751
You can't see them but they're there

71
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,847
It says so right there on the label

72
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
Power Ranger

73
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
I'm sorry Marsha

74
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
Okay

75
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,087
Anyway I don't care about Spider-Man and things

76
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:47,487
How do you say by Kristian make my milk taste so good

77
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,303
Like milk with chocolate in it

78
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,167
Well Bosco's good for you

79
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447

80
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,799

81
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,615
I just like the taste good

82
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
Looks like you foolish

83
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,711
Monster storage Mart

84
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
But kids are smarter

85
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
Little girls voice

86
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,391
Add a powerful effect on me

87
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
Because she sounded is real

88
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,279
Is the girl who lived in the Bungalow next door to us

89
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
A few days later

90
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,495
Sitting in the back seat of the family car we drove past WKBW in downtown Buffalo

91
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:37,151
I peered out the window at the station and wondered if the Bosco syrup girl live there I mean

92
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
The girl in the commercial be on the radio like that

93
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
All the time

94
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,087
I haven't yet learned about the Wonders

95
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
Tape recorder

96
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,463
Well I sat in the car

97
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,791
Pondering the whereabouts of the Bosco syrup girl

98
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,863
375 miles to the South

99
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
New York City

100
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
Was the man who made

101
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Bosco syrup

102
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
Radio commercial

103
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Is name

104
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
Tony Schwartz

105
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,151
Does a radio producer and audio archivist

106
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:16,319
Tony Schwartz specialized in recording commercials with real people instead of recording actors trying to 4

107
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
Trey real people

108
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
Which meant

109
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:24,511
Bosco syrup girl was a real child and not a 35 year old actor playing a child

110
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
Schwartz's production philosophy

111
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,935
To avoid the use of any music or unnecessary sound effects

112
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
And when he did work with actors

113
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,079
Sports directed them not to sound like actors

114
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
In this way

115
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
Tony Schwartz was radio advertisements first

116
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Modernist

117
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,063
A fire breaks out on the first floor of the two family house

118
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,135
The woman quickly leaves to call the fire department

119
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
Torn two people died upstairs

120
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
Overcome

121
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Buy smok

122
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,839
A man smoking in bed starts a fire

123
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:05,215
Leaves the bedroom brushes to a phone a door before the fire department gets there

124
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:11,615
The door rest of his house burns down the door is there one single act that could have been.

125
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:17,759
Help prevent this needless loss of life and property close the door should these people have done

126
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,063

Close the doors the door will help stop the fire and smoke from spreading to quickly close the door

130
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,983

And a New York City Fire Department

133
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
After I turn 9

134
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:56,159
Every summer I was ritually shipped to California to spend time with my cousin

135
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
In San Francisco

136
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Like most children

137
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,815
I was fond of Saturday morning cartoons

138
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
The more cartoons I watched

139
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,191
The more familiar I became with the characters

140
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
And the more familiar I became with characters

141
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
Fox Popeye Bullwinkle

142
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
More notice of their specific voices

143
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
But there was one voice I like most

144
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
Perhaps because he sounded so

145
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
On cartoon like

146
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343

How big a role he would play in the evolution of Sound Radio commercials

173
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
But whenever I heard his voice

174
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
Got my attention

175
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
One night

00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,855

Why should I advertise on radio

184
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:18,751
There's nothing to look at no pictures I seen you do things on the radio You couldn't possibly do on TV

185
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
That'll be the day alright watched

186
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,127
Okay people and now when I give you the cue

187
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,271
I want these 700-foot Mountain the whipped cream to roll into Lake Michigan which has been drained and filled with hot chocolate

188
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:35,903
Royal Canadian Air Force will fly overhead towing a 10-ton maraschino cherry

189
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
Which will be dropped into the whipped cream

190
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
Returning a 25000 extra

191
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,399
Is alright to the mountain

192
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
Leaderboard

193
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
University

194
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,759
Okay 25000 Cherry next Drive

195
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
Now you want to try that on television

196
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,111
We're already was a very special made

197
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
Because it stretches the imagination

198
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,999
Television stretch the imagination

199
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
Who listens to radio

200
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:21,215
Was part of an advocacy campaign sponsored by the radio advertising Bureau of America

201
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,799
To encourage clients to buy more radio time

202
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,895
Apparently radio was going through a sales drought

203
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
Nevertheless

204
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,015
Stan freberg was the main voice of the Epic radio commercial

205
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
That's what caught my attention

206
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:42,463
Deering Freiburg Commando 700 foot mountain of whipped cream being rolled into Lake Michigan

207
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,815
While the Royal Canadian Air Force code a giant Maraschino through the sky

208
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,143
It flipped a switch in my imagination

209
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
Is nothing happy for

210
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,263
This was bigger than the Bosco chocolate syrup girl

211
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
She was still pretty good

212
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
To a nine-year-old

213
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
2 weeks

214
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
Feels like a year

215
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:11,647
That was more than enough time for me to untether myself from The Familiar sounds of Buffalo

216
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,975
And absorb the subtly different tone and tempo

217
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
California

218
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
California

219
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,519
Two weeks on the west coast and cleared my mind

220
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,359
I'm ready for the next phase in my radio commercial Journey

221
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
After my vacation ended

222
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,623
I was sent home to Buffalo via the scenic route

223
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:49,791
I spent most of my time in the observation car with the new transistor radio my uncle Owen had given me

224
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
Is it going away present

225
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
The radio

226
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
Model named Juliet

227
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,727
Was about the size of an iPhone 5

228
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
It was an inch deep

229
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
And came with a leather cover

230
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
Airsoft

231
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
The Lamb's Ear

232
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
The most importance

233
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
You had

234
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
An earplug

235
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,855
The earplug look like a piece of automotive technology from the Balkan Wars

236
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
Brown and round is a walnut

237
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,231
Attached to the radio by a coiled wire

238
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,839
Listening with the ear plug was a new experience for me

239
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
Was like being in

240
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
A radio cocoon

241
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
Station after station

242
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,287
Commercial after commercial

243
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
I slowly began

244
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Overdose

245
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
Timeade

246
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
A disturbing discovery

247
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
The more I listen

248
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,415
The more I recognize the sameness of all the stations and commercials

249
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,743
After hours in the second chamber

250
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
A group award

251
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
I wanted to hear

252
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,351
Something new or something different

253
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
2 Days Later

254
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,495
After passing through the American Heartland

255
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,567
The train had a one-hour layover in Chicago

256
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,895
My plan was to stay on the train

257
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
Listen to the ballgame

258
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,015
And read The Amazing Spider-Man number 38

259
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
During the first inning

260
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
I fell asleep

261
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
I have a dream

262
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,487
You can call it

263
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
Is now

264
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
I am in Chicago

265
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,335
Belize might rain season go outside

266
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
I'm walking through a secret tunnel

267
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
But I have to be careful

268
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
Because it was dark

269
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
I don't let to a theater

270
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
Suddenly

271
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
Bud Light come on

272
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:55,487
The lanky man in a black suit blocks of a few steps onto the stage

273
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,071
Impose a greasy Sheaf of papers

274
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Instaread

275
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
A small jazz band

276
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
Get to work

277
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Behind him

278
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
Want you to know that I love my baby

279
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
And my baby loves me

280
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,199
Short time ago we went out together

281
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
A place called ferret

282
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
Double rainbow

283
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:26,975
The Rhythm was they having stillborn held my babies and she gave me a list

284
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,559
I knew we were in the same key

285
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
Everything is beginning to swing

286
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
The quiet years later

287
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,311
I would learn that this combination of writing and music that was called

288
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
The word jazz

289
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,663
The Pioneer who created

290
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,735
Was a man called Ken nordine

291
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Then

292
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
I heard a train whistle

293
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
I woke up

294
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Nice nap

295
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,207
Back into reality

296
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
In the beginning

297
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,351
Nordine was simply a writer and a performer

298
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
A lot to say

299
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,447
To supplement his meager income

300
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,031
He began making radio commercials in the world jazz style

301
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
As we pulled out of Chicago

302
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,895
Nordine commercial played

303
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
My Juliet radio earphone

304
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Heaven's head open

305
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
I heated The Voice

306
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
I could be

307
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
Think with your tongue

308
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
About lemon

309
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
From the first smack

310
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
Your tongue can tell the lemon

311
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
Something else

312
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,935
Something so subtly obvious

313
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
Buy something so obviously sad

314
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Yet

315
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,663
There was a feeling among yesterday's times

316
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,015
The something else that is lemon wasn't getting its just desserts

317
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,343
But that was before the sheriff labor but

318
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:03,999
Nothing secret about slavery but accepted gives you a perfect Lemon Jelly dessert every time

319
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:10,399
Best thing that's happened to 11 since trees best thing that's happened for tongue since please

320
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,751
Play Everybody's what makes this lemonsoda lemony lemon

321
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:21,151
Reward your family with the sheriff jelly dessert Meyer lemon not all

322
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,759
Jellies are created equal so ask for share of jelly dessert

323
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,743
The lemon dessert radio spot was like nothing I'd ever heard

324
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
But it was just

325
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
What I've been searching for

326
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,631
Nordeen have created something fresh

327
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,167
My seemingly came

328
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
They didn't have much hope

329
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,847
Did anything else like this would be coming down the line

330
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,175
Perhaps I was too young to see

331
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,711
Nordine was a harbinger

332
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,623
On the last Friday of the summer of 66

333
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,415
I arrived in Buffalo

334
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,511
But I wouldn't be there long because that night at dinner

335
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
My father announced the family

336
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
Is moving to Toronto

337
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
As long as I had my comics

338
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,703
Giulia radio

339
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,287
And uninterrupted access to my favorite Buffalo media

340
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,687
The move to Toronto meant little to me even be a good thing

341
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,623
As a child growing up in the sixties

342
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,671
I can't say I love jingles

343
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
In the 60s

344
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,559
All the jingles I heard word reiterations of Jingles from the past

345
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
Sure

346
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,399
It was cute as a basket of puppies

347
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,679
For the most part

348
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,751
Nothing more than tuneless mindless junk

349
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,335
That was until the summer of 1967

350
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,503
Very strange things begin to happen in the universe of the lowly jingle

351
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
67 The Beatles record Sergeant Pepper at just come out and popular music suffer.

352
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,207
Massive disruption

353
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:15,071
Guitars Barnyard sound at Illusions to Lewis Carroll and stockhausen

354
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,143
Sergeant Pepper's land with a bang

355
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:24,543
And so big what's the batting Sergeant Pepper's that jingle producers on a mad scramble to copy the new

356
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,591
You sound

357
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,895
One of my neighbors

358
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,479
Went berserk

359
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,039
At a barbecue one night

360
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,343
I remember more telling my mother

361
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
This is the biggest thing ever

362
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
What am I going to do

363
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,743
How can I compete with a goddamn Beatles

364
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
My mother

365
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,607
Looks solemnly at her freshly manicured fingernails

366
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,399
I said nothing

367
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
Beatles course

368
00:19:53,983 --> 00:20:00,127
I've always been badgered to endorse products the being the Beatles it was not to be

369
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:06,527
Is a Beatles wouldn't make a triangle there were plenty of musicians who would stay

370

00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,951
The Jefferson Aeroplane accepted an invitation to make a jingle

372
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:20,607
The invitation and by way of Levi Strauss the clothing company who are anxious to draw attention

373
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
Line of white jeans

374
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:28,031
It may take a second or two to grasp what you were about to hear but it's a jingle all right

375
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,079
Summer of Love Triangle

It was produced by Frank Zappa

382
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,928
Teaming up with an unknown singer Linda Ronstadt

383
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,768
Zappa produced one of the most magnificent liad jingles

384
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
History of radio

394
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:19,296
Over the next three years I adjusted to my new life in the Dominion of Canada

395
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,832
I went to school

396
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,160
Stumble through the nuances of Canadian English

397
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:31,072
And because Buffalo was only 35 miles south of Toronto across Lake Ontario I could still pick up

398
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,864
My favorite Buffalo stations

399
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,192

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
When I was 12

405
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,904
My voice began to break

406
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,952

In radio commercials

409
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096

410
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376

I read copy from a magazine ad

419
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,024
To make my first radio commercial

420
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
Experience

421
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,128

We sat in the dark

442
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
And waited

443
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,632

444
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424

Through the mouth

459

465
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:26,592
When FM radio came on the scene I put my Juliette portable transistor radio in retirement

466
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:31,456
Acquired a new portable Panasonic radio with AM FM reception

Of irony

475
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,920
I was always on the outlook for tiny ironic moments

476
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
To test my new capacity

477
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,248

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,464
I mean it's right there

556
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,864
As easy to get to cuz they are to talk to at the Winner's Circle

557
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:53,408
After two days on the job I was shocked when one of the senior producer has invited me into the studio

558
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
The witness the production of a radio commercial

559
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,016
Blisters

560
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,576
Will never set foot in a recording studio

561
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,112
Here's how it looks

562
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:07,232
The recording environment is comprised of two rooms Studio

563
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
And I control row

564
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:14,400
Studio soundproof and contains microphones and headphones for the performers

565
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,680
The control room

566
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:19,776
As a variety of speakers recording devices and a mixing console

567
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,824
Which allows you to edit

568
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,872
How to assemble the recorded material

569
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,688
There was also plush seating

570
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:31,040
Includes leather-bound sofas to catch the occasional spilled drink

571
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,344
In those days

572
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,744
The control room era was Richmond the unmistakable Aroma of Ampex 456 recording tape

573
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,536
Kohl's campfire smoke

574
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,840
And styrofoam packing peanuts

575
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,656
Are asteroids everywhere

576
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,240
Strewn around the road like sleepy domestic house cats

577
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:54,336
Where the Coterie of writers producers and client Representatives

578
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:59,200
Given the often experimental aesthetic of the time

579
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,272
Excessive Second City and Saturday Night Live

580
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:08,672
Many commercial recording sessions relied not on Scripps but on the improvisational Talent of the performers

581
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,000
I remember being at more than real one night

582
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,560
Watching Second City record a commercial

583
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
We're not coming federal election

584
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
Here's an outtake

585
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,752
What do you have to do to get people involved in politics

586
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,336
I sure we could rent buses for them and force them to go to these meetings

587
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
I think

588
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,688
What do you think we have to do to get people involved in politics

589
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,992
I think we should have send the more letters

590
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,296
I tell them what's happening and

591
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
Make them read them

592
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:42,976
Excuse me what do you think we're going to have to do to get people involved in politics and good government wash if they don't go to the meeting she attacks

593
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
Just talk some real heavy

594
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
Hit him where it hurts in the pocket

595
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,840
I think

596
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
Political party

597
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
Should be parties

598
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,680
I think that's what people are

599
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
Attracted to fun

600
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,008
And you make politics fun

601
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
And you got a lot of

602
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,896
Great things about working at Morgan oral

603
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,688
For the out-of-town guests

604
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,968
Henry Winkler

605
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,248
William Shatner

606
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,528
And Alice Cooper

607
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,088
I'll stop by for one reason or another

608
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
Familiar face at the studio

609
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:16,256
San francisco-based radio Raider interviewer and genius

610
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,280
Mouse Sharp

611
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
Mao specialty

612
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,656
Is the man on the street radio commercial

613
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,680
I spent one day

614
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,520
Operator assisting now recording some commercials outside

615
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,360
Piles fedora

616
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
Mao

617
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:36,224
Is one of the most fascinating and charismatic men

618
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,504
I have ever met

619
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,576
Of the many lessons mom taught me that day

620
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,392
The most important lessons in fact was

621
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
How to talk

622
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
With complete strangers

623
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,536
Malka talked almost anyone

624
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,584
Because he knew the power

625
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,656
A kindness

626
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,312
Well this is a mouse sharp along with Randy Anderson and of course in the background you hear the people of California

627
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:07,712
Chanting for valbrun to defeat the Rival chip you can hear them as they sing Bell by Bryan Bell by brand

628
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:14,112
Brian in the background man you're out here and you can hear these people if you think this is going to be good for sales

629
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:18,720
It's the new thing it's new anything you understand what they're chanting

630
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:28,960
Potato chips a dog what does it sound like

631
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:35,360
I mean it's incongruous so in summation you think it's going to be a good year for Bell brand potato chips as long as they stay

632
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:40,480
So I think it's going to be a good year for betabrand

633
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:45,344
Regardless of the chanting because their product is so good

634
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,672
Now what else do you want from me

635
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:53,024
If it's it's 12

636
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:59,424
Did you notice the pint-sized musical flourish at the end of the Bell potato chips pot

637
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
It's called a tag

638
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:09,152
Tags belong to a musical genre that began as an experiment for a waiting breakfast cereal in 1926

639
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
Abuse

640
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:25,792
What began as an audio experiment for a waning breakfast cereal in 1926

641
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
Wood

642
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:30,400
Over the next five decades become a distinct Musical 4

643
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
Call

644
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
A jingle

645
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:38,336
Although I was exposed to thousands of jingles in my childhood

646
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,384
To what you've already heard

647
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,712
Who'd have known there was a creative jingle explosion

648
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,760
Just around the corner

649
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,624
Shingles have been around since the beginning of radio

650
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,672
The 1970s

651
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
We had Peak

652
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,232
Jingle

653
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,816
But since they fell out of fashion so long ago

654
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,120
This might be a good time to review

655
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,656
What actually makes a jingle

656
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
A jingle

657
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,056
Shingles always have a catchy Melody that's easy to sing

658
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
They must be earworms

659
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,688
Brewing their way in and staying there for days

660
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,224
Lyrically

661
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:21,344
Some Jingles try to create a vague atmosphere of desire in the listener's imagination

662
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
Other kinds of triangles

663
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,464
Play to The Listener with more specific Appeals

664
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,024
Underlining the virtue of a product's price

665
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
Speed

666
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
Sexy news

667
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,120
Or mouth-watering ingredients

668
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
Traditional jingles

669
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
Come with the chorus of singers

670
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:49,760
Repeat a catchphrase or tagline near the end

671
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,600
What did jingle really does

672
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
Is bind an emotion

673
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
To a product

674
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:02,560
Service

675
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
By Design

676
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:20,224
Ingles bypass the analytical lobes in the brain and instead

677
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
Stimuli

678
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,784
The nucleus accumbens

679
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,320
For pleasure centers

680
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,112
Once you hear it

681
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,952
A jingle creates an itch that you can't stop scratching

682
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,816
Between 1970 and 1980

683
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,632
Add companies produce thousands of shingles

684
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
And for good reason

685
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:51,456
Change was in the air in the 1970s a new generation of very sophisticated

686
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:57,344
What is a jingle jungle and couldn't help and write music that appeal to their generation

687
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:01,184
None of this came as a big surprise to me

688
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,720
Because in many ways

689
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
I was one of them

690
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,584
Growing up on a diet of Steely Dan

691
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
Joni Mitchell

692
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,656
How could I not have them

693
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
Fake dr pepper

694
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:27,040
The first time I heard be a pepper in 77 I had to pull over to the side of the road

695
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:32,160
Randy Newman and Jake Holmes wrote the jingle which begins with a startling statement

696
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,976
I drink dr. pepper cuz I'm proud

697
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,768
I used to be alone

698
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
In a crowd

699
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
What

700
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,424
A dr. Pepper bottle to cure for alienation

701
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
Let's take a sip

702
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
MC

703
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
For me

704
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Be a pepper

705
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
Was an Awakening

706
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:03,295
Listings for calling radio stations requesting to hear a hit song

707
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
Power of this fact

708
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,879
Wasn't lost on me

709
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,183
At 20 years old

710
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,743
I began producing radio commercials

711
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,815
Can I join the musicians and actors Union

712
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,095
I began writing

713
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:22,495
Play the singing on jingles

714
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,055
Reading to Union newsletters

715
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,383
I discovered the Toronto was a hobbit wrinkle innovation

716
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,943
What does a real spider of the universe

717
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
Was

718
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
New York

719
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
40 seconds

720
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,343
So

721
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,415
Like thousands of starry-eyed kids with a dream

722
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,207
1984

723
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,743
I moved to Gotham City

724
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,535
Department

725
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,351
And hit the pavement with my demo tape in hand

726
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,679
As luck would have it

727
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,727
I was still working

728
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,615
I was a writer and a producer

729
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:03,199
I work for ad agencies and sound production companies

730
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:08,575
I listen to As radio ad shortened from 60 seconds to 30 seconds

731
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,903
I gasped a great tivity was off and crushed

732
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,695
Find increasingly Powerful Beast

733
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,999
Call market research

734
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,327
Despite the many obstacles

735
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,655
I was always in the studio doing what I loved most

736
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,471
Making radio

737
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,551
No matter what place I am or era I'm living in

738
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:46,207
One thing has always been clear to me radio commercials are never the main course

739
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:52,607
What's a complimentary basket of garlic bread you get at an Italian restaurant radio commercials

740
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,167
Order the rapper

741
00:44:55,423 --> 00:45:01,567
Something you expect and sometimes take the light in of course I'm like today

742
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,871
Complimentary basket of garlic bread

743
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:08,735
The very first radio commercial was written and produced without a known format

744
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,759
Fallout

745
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,575
No one knew how short or how long it should be

746
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,367
But if it would work at all

747
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:18,207
And what if anything would happen after it went to air

748
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,535
August 28 1922

749
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,839
Wef radio in there you are

750
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,143
A man called

751
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,423
Mr. Blackwell

752
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,775
Stood behind Mike and urged unsuspecting listeners to leave Manhattan

753
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:36,127
The family-friendly tree-lined streets of your health

754
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
May depend on it

755
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,575
Enjoy

756
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
Jackson Heights

757
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,511
Friendly environment

758
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,631
History doesn't say what happened to Blackwell

759
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,471
The response to the radio commercial was overwhelming

760
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,775
Because within days

761
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,311
The Viking Apartments

762
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,615

Golf

764
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,711
All of this

765
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,039
Because of one simple radio commercial

766
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:20,159
The Hawthorne radio Caracol spread

767
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,231
Every Station in New York understood the potential

768
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,255
Crushed

769
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,583
Finally

770
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,631
Way to make real money

771
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,423
Radio Embrace commercials

772
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,983
Radio commercials became a mainstay

773
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,519
The radio experience

774
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:41,151
What began as an audio experiments from 90 years ago

775
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,223
Eventually became a worldwide industry

776
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,271
Billions of dollars

777
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,575
Brilliant

778
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
Silly

779
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,903
Thought-provoking or moving

780
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,207
The Humble radio commercial

781
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
Became the fuel

782
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,071
Allows radio to play the news

783
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
Music

784
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,399
Stories

785
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,191
We've been listening to

786
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,471
Ever since

787
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,543
For the organist

788
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,615
KCRW and mcsweeney's

789
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,151
Onclive

790
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
Desmond

791
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:31,071
This was just an edited version of part 1 of Clive Desmond's two-part personal history of radio advertising

792
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:35,423
Do the rest check out the organist from KCRW and mcsweeney's

793
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:41,823
There's a link on a website or on the subject of the sound

794
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:48,223
Radio changing our lives I wanted to share a clip of me talking about my first favorite radio story which is

795
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:54,623
Isn't a radio story at all it's from a movie that's right after this

796
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:04,095
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of May

797
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,119
Handmade sound

798
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:11,775
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me in my

799
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:18,175
Wife is another room in a voice technology talk to us

800
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,479
It is a creation of Sonic trash

801
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:27,135
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

802
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,183
To make them more human

803
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,023
Turn the living room lights on

804
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,815
Okay

805
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,375
Dim the living room lights to 50%

806
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
Okay

807
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:45,567
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

808
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,639
Makes for a much more natural experience

809
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,431
Turn the living room lights on

810
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,527
Dim the living room lights to 50%

811
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:03,231

You take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating but doesn't have to Define you

819
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:33,951

828
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,695
Chuck has his new podcast it's really fantastic it's called movie Crush

829
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:10,047
Where he might people he likes to talk about their favorite movie of all time

830
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,351

831
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,399
Belle Isle of Jaws

832
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:18,751
And so does Chuck actually and my favorite scene is when the Shark Hunter Quint

833
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:23,615
Tell the story of him being left in the water after his ship that USS Indianapolis

834
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,151
Was sunk in World War II

835
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,943
So here's a part of that monologue

836
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:32,319
Japanese submarine slammed two Torpedoes into our side gif

837
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,623
It's going back

838
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,975
The island of tinian the lady just delivered the bomb

839
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,511
Hiroshima bomb

840
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,631
Eleven hundred men went into the water

841
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,447
Michelin down in 12 minutes

842
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,311
Didn't see the first job for about a half an hour

843
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,847
Tiger

844
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,919
13 footer you know how you know that when you're in the water chief

00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,671
What about mission of Ben so Secret

00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,055
Very first black chief

851
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,847
Conclusion

852
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,919
Sweet formula shows into tight groups

853
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:38,367
Satellite gold squares in the Battle Lake nuc in a calendar leave the Battle of Waterloo in the idea was

854
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:44,767
Jack is the nearest man that many steps pounding hollering and screaming sometimes

855
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,607
Sometimes he wouldn't go away

856
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,423
Sometimes that shaggy looks right into you

857
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,215
Smile into your eyes

858
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,543
You know anything about is Shaggy's gun

859
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,359
Lifeless eyes

860
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,919
Black eyes like a doll's eyes

861
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,247
Soca

862
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,295
Music of me talking to Chuck Bryant

863
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
About that scene

864
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,343
On with the crusher

865
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,623
I love

866
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
Radio

867
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
So much

868
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,255
I love the storytelling radio

869
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,071
It is still like my ideal form

870
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,631
And I think of Quinn story as the first

871
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,167
Radio story

872
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,447
I ever really loved

873
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,727
If yak

874
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,775
It is told

875
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,567
Just perfectly

876
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,615
Like right like you could almost see it

877
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,663
Like

878
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:40,063
Storycorps music starts

879
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,879
It starts you remember some teenager going oh my God

880
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,927
Can't believe

881
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,231
Is it perfectly told natural

882
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:51,583
I think I just think the radius or I would cut it out and put on the radio in Heartbeats

883
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
Perfect

884
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,911
And it's funny cuz there's all this stuff all this

885
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,751
Rate activity you've already had the adventure music playing

886
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:02,847
You know in the barrels and shooting it and everything that that moment

887
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,639
So riveting

888
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,199
That's my favorite moment in the movie

889
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,759
I mean one of mine for sure and

890
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:13,087
The backstory there for that scene was that that was not in the book

891
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,671
Spielberg brought in the Great

892
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,487
Screenwriter and filmmaker John Milius

893
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,279
To write that monologue

894
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:26,911
And then apparently Robertshaw himself to who was a playwright went in and

895
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,983
And did some rewriting on it and kind of worked with Milius on it

896
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,799
You know Justin's up being

897
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,847
Like one of most iconic monologues

898
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:41,247
Movie history for sure it is so good and it's so naturally moves from one scene to this car comparing to the other

899
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,783
Weather and

900
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,623
In the fact that I've thought about this a lot it's like

901
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,207
Because it's get called out because they're comparing scars and Brody says

902
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,743
What's that on your arm

903
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,279
And it's at its

904
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:57,631
The removal of the tattoo of the Union Indianapolis right and

905
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:00,191
And I think about that all the time like

906
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:07,103
Remove it and like what is going on in his head that he would remove it instead of keep it there

907
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
And

908
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:11,455
With every part of his character that you get in other ways

909
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,295
That seems like this extreme moment in his life

910
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:19,391
That you have no knowledge of it just have this little tiny peek into

911
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,695
And I love that part of it too

912
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,487
I never thought about that

913
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,279
That is super interesting that you would

914
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,303
Annette Annette

915
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,119
The old Sailors don't have tattoos removed

916
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,959
Yeah yeah exactly to like that the level of

917
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:37,567
Trauma or whatever he was trying to get away from or whatever it was like it was

918
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,871
