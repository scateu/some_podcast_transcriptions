I'm Roman Mars

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,928
People who make horror movies know that if you want to scare someone

27
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,720
Use scary music

28
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,048
And when we want to explore the design of music

29
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,096
We call rishikesh Railway

Song exploder

32
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,472
So here are two fundamental ways to make something sound scary

33
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,032
According to evolutionary biologist Dan blumstein

34
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
The first way is to use lots of screeching irregular

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,896
Animals when they're scared

36
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:57,760
Are blowing a lot of air across their vocal cords or cross their syrinx if there are bird

37
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,344
And the sounds of Screams are something that is

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Arousing

39
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
And makes people feel negative

40
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
It's biological your lizard brain hears Bernard Herman's knife stabbing music and psycho and Sassy

41
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,144
Something terrible is happening right now

42
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,216
The second way sound can make you feel uneasy

43
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
To go the other way

44
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
Make really low ground

45
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,968
Another biological Cube that might lead to fear and anxiety is hearing low frequency

46
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:34,368
The lowest frequency of a species can produce as a function of its body size so low frequency

47
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
Probably should scare you

48
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,464
It it might mean if something big is around

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,584
Makes those both together and you're on your way to creating classic scary music for scary movies

50
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
Good horror movies aren't just meant to be horrifying exciting fun so it's sometimes nice to have a

51
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Driving beat

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,160
The music from the movie Halloween by composer John Carpenter will always greet me out

53
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,464
And also give me kind of excited

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,304
And some Sahara movies I certainly know that I respond

55
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
2

56
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,912
Sound in horror movies in ways that are complex

57
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Soundtrack Sorrentino

58
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,080
That's a very specific thing that provokes drag

59
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,200
David Slade is very good at evoking dread himself

Episode of Hannibal and unexpected from the show and I pretty much time makes every

63
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
Episode

64
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,816
I've been binging on the TV show Hannibal for the past couple weeks and it really gets under your skin it's the story of it

65
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,376
Serial killer named Hannibal Lecter who you may know from

66
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
Silence of the Lambs and Manhunter

67
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
This is kind of a prequel to The Story

68
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
Hannibal

69
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,848
Is a nasty character who commits brisley and unspeakable crimes

70
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:05,248
The other main character is Will Graham FBI profiler with a knack for getting inside the heads of serial killer

71
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
Taylor is to try to catch them

72
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Trust me

73
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,624
There is nothing fun going on inside Will Graham set

74
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,232
An inside will Graham's head is exactly where the sound design of Hannibal

75
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
Trying to place the viewer

76
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,399
Program for July 16-17 recognizes patents as what he does he reconstructs things in his head

77
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
It's a mental issue

78
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
Synopsis

79
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
These are things that we want

80
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
How to make an audio

81
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:37,759
This is from the first episode of Hannibal

82
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:50,815
All the classic horror movie music we mentioned before exist outside the world of the story and other words it's not

83
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
Being heard by the characters being depicted

84
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,727
It's just being heard by the audience but composer Brian reitzell score for Hannibal feels different

85
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:02,335
You get a sense that it's even being heard by Will Graham inside his own imagination

86
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,687
Our whole goal with horror really is to

87
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:13,087
Transport people into the other reality and it's a scary reality it's a tense reality but it's a

88
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
The beautiful place to

89
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
But to do that I find the most effective way to scare people is to throw sounds of them

90
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
That are unfamiliar to them

91
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,887
So Brian construx new sounds that the audience can't place

92
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Create Anis

93
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,471
Guitar what is that

94
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,127
A lot of what we do is create all of the sound so we turn all the sound effects off

95
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,711
And the ones that we think are important we try to make

96
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,527
Tell me that resembles that sound or feels like that sound

97
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
I don't differentiate

98
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
Really between

99
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,415
Ambient sounds like a motor and

100
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Abase

101
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
So in this case

102
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,559
She's on a motorcycle I had to be really interesting to

103
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,887
Make the feeling of what it would be like

104
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,679
Being on that motorcycle

105
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
Rush of adrenaline in the Wind

106
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,847
Sound of engine which is underneath you I mean all this is very powerful

107
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Stop self

108
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,991
The first idea I had was to do it with an upright Bass

109
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,391
Just listening up and down the neck

110
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,959
The Q starts with with the motorcycle starting up

111
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
So we do lots of little things in there too

112
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Mimic

113
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
Or hinted those sound

114
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,151
On-screen Racine the key turn

115
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
Castanets

116
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
Can we see the

117
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
Flames from the engine

118
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
The sound of sheep

119
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
Is me bowing a wood block

120
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
River by and sounds

121
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,631
The more I work with the different instruments the more I understand what you can get out of them

122
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,735
Almost all the towns in Hannibal start out as an acoustic element from Brian rifles Workshop

123
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:23,135
Then the effort is made to strip it of identifying characteristics that would ground the sound in the real world

124
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,231
I'm constantly trying to d guitar a guitar or

125
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
Drama drama

126
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:38,495
Best Brian placing a wooden Chopstick on a snare drum and pulling a violin bow across the

127
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Chopstick

128
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,639
You could never tell by listening that Chopstick bow or a drum made this sound

129
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:54,623
Brian doesn't just take regular instruments and make them weird he also takes weird instruments and makes them weirder

130
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,463
I went around Brian's Studio as he pulled out examples of the instruments uses

131
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,047
For example the sound of synapses firing inside will grab his head

132
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
It started out as a newton

133
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,167
Gradle if you don't know a Newton Cradle by name you definitely know the sound

134
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,239
I already knows it's it's on your desk

135
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:15,103
You know it's at pendulum toy with a stainless steel balls hanging from strings

136
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,895
But what I do is I used it as it

137
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
I use it to Trophies rhythm

138
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
A synapse in your brain

139
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Stop

140
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,951
And did some different treatments at those and use those other

141
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:35,583
Percussion instrument because he actually broken in the process they were originally five balls that were a perfect unison

142
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
Even the most innocuous answer

143
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
Can Sinister in the hands of

144
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:45,055
Play sleigh bells I I just used in this first episode of Hannibal because I had

145
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
Snails

146
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,407
And I had to use macro shots of snails

147
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,967
But really it's ceased

148
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,583
David Slade calls the sound design of Hannibal

149
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Free associative

150
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
They look at the footage

151
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,543
And talk about the characters in the feelings are trying to evoke from each scene and design from their the big bad guy in anabolism

152
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,383
Hannibal Lecter also is wrestling with his own demons

153
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
He has green like visions of a demon they call the windigo that represents both the evil of Hannibal and the eve

154
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,343
Evil growing inside Will Graham one of the character

155
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Developed

156
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Time

157
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
What's the wendigo character which

158
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
Is the bassist

159
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
Off

160
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,279
And we wanted a sound that indicate

161
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
The coming of that character

162
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
That sound

163
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
I knew it was sucking

164
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,655
We didn't know why but we knew I was right

165
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,983
And I took what David said literally and

166
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
I got a bull Roar

167
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,567
Have a basically it's a piece of wood

168
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
On a string

169
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Smokey oldest

170
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,175
Instruments but it sounds incredible

171
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
You spin it in a circular manner

172
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783
Slices through the air creating this

173
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Turtle sound

174
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Once we put it against

175
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
Sweeney

176
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
Very physical sounding

177
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
Sort of cutting through the air

178
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
Spinning around your head

179
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Making it

180
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
Surreal yet also

181
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Gary V

182
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
I also did things

183
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
2.2

184
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,831
I pitched it down I could sit up

185
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
To make it scarier

186
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,183
Mission accomplished guys

187
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,111
Richie case her way is the creator of song exploder

188
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,719
Which I'm very proud to say is now a member of the radiotopia collective

189
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,303
I'm so excited song Exploder is when my favorite podcasts in the

190
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
Premise is just perfect

191
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,959
Musicians take apart their songs piece-by-piece to tell the story of how they were made

192
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,615
If you've never heard song Exploder before I want to present what I think is my favorite episodes so far featuring Ja

193
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,663
John Roderick of the long Winters but

194
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,479
I have a hard time picking a favorite I really think

195
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,295
You just download them all and pick your own favorite

196
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,879
Now from radiotopia this is song exploder

197
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
My fellow Americans

198
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
This day has brought terrible news

199
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
Great sadness to our country

200
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
At 9 this morning

201
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
Mission Control in Houston

202
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
Lost contact

203
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
What are space shuttle Columbia

204
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
A short time later

205
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,055
Debris was seen falling from the skies above text

206
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
The Columbia is lost

207
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
There are no survivors

208
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,039
That was President George W bush

209
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,855
Addressing the nation on February 1st 2003

210
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,207
Couple years later John Roderick singer and songwriter of The Long Winters

211
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,023
Recorded the song about the space shuttle Columbia on that day

212
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
Is it broke apart while reentering the Earth's atmosphere

213
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
It's called

214
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,751
This episode is made from an interview I did with John Roderick in front of a live audience in Seattle

215
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,799
About how and why he made the song

216
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:42,623
I feel

217
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
I am John Roderick

218
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,471
I have my pilot's license when I was 17 my dad was a

219
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
Small plane pilot

220
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,823
And that was the way my dad was one of the ways that we bonded

221
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
In a small plane

222
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
I'll try to make it over amount

223
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
So I had a lot of experience

224
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
I always loved

225
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Supply and when the

226
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
Nose comes off the ground

227
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
I always

228
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Feeling chart

229
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
I didn't want to be a

230
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,071
But at that point

231
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
In 2005

232
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
We were still

233
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,727
Pretty close to 9:11 and the space shuttle

234
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
Disaster followed

235
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
Pretty close on the heels of a

236
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,895
But also there were all those smaller

237
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,711
The Alaska Airlines

238
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
Crash that happened off the coast of California where

239
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
Or they lost their

240
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,367
Vertical stabilizer the Jack screw one

241
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:51,743
The pilots were aware there was a problem everyone was aware there was a problem and just flew around and then

242
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
Flipped upside down in Plymouth

243
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:59,167
And then there was the one off of Long Island where maybe the gas tank exploded

244
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,959
And then there was that Learjet

245
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
That

246
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,287
Lost compression and everybody in it

247
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,591
Gone until it ran out of gas

248
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
And all of these

249
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
Disasters stuck with me

250
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:14,783
Digitally the ones where there was a sense that the people onboard knew that they

251
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
We're lost but they were still alive

252
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:22,207
The unfolding Dawning realization like you know we're not getting out of this

253
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:28,863
And what's your reaction in that situation do you do you scream you probably don't probably everybody is real

254
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
Situation in

255
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
The astronauts

256
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,055
On re-entry there was something wrong with

257
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
They were

258
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,639
Worry about it but everybody had convinced them in

259
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
And there

260
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
Performing their duties

261
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
They're having the peak experience of their lives and maybe one of the peak human experiences like we are coming

262
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Back to her

263
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Having just

264
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:59,071
Look down at Earth and had that feeling how beautiful that kind of dumb little stuff is the Butte

265
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
Beauty of the mundane

266
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
Boys and girls in cars in

267
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
Dogs and birds on Laurens light

268
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
Sing it baby

269
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
Like no one else

270
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,247
Dogs

271
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,087
Online

272
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,487
From here I can touch

273
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,047
The song

274
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,607
Did you sit down at the idea that you were going to

275
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
Write a song about this

276
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
Space shuttle disaster

277
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
Yeah but I didn't know how it was going to

278
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Work

279
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,591
Every once in awhile you get one as a songwriter where you sit down at your instrument

280
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
You have an idea

281
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,199
You have a first line you sing it and

282
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
Compose the entire song in

283
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
In an hour

284
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
When you go I don't know where that came

285
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,071
I resisted piano lessons

286
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,887
As a kid but sometime in high school

287
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,959
I started to sit at the piano voluntarily

288
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
When no one was home

289
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
And trying

290
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Figure it out

291
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
And I got as far as

292
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,431
You could go if you were just practicing for 11 minutes at a time

293
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
And I didn't really learn the piano until I was in my thirties

294
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
Learn the piano as much as

295
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,623
In the early 90s

296
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
In Seattle especially

297
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,487
There was a mentality that you didn't want to over learn

298
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
Your instrument

299
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,119
Right because that was going to affect the authenticity of your feelings

300
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,703
And I embrace that Hook Line & Sinker

301
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
So the producer of this

302
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
Track was Tucker Martin

303
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,383
Tucker head up just a stand-up parlor piano in his living room

304
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
That was recorded

305
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,479
Now we would probably just

306
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,015
Record at 1

307
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
Measure and lupus

308
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,623
But at the time I had to sit and play it

309
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,231
For 5 minutes and then I would get to the end and he be like

310
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:10,143
Let's hit it again

311
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
Eric Corson

312
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Long layers

313
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
And my chief

314
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
Musical park

315
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
He sat down at

316
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
At the micro cord which is not an instrument

317
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
What she knew

318
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
But he worked with it for a little bit and

319
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
Figured it out

320
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
There are

321
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,071
Five or six moments in the song that without Eric

322
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Part

323
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
It would be so much

324
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
Less of a complete

325
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
His part is very cinematic

326
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,087
As the song unfolded

327
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
It just starts to go sideways

328
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,415
Every successive

329
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
Stuff

330
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Most of The Long Winter songs are

331
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,047
About relationships and they are

332
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
Intentionally

333
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
Difficult to parse

334
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,215
Because they're meant to communicate in an emotional language rather than in a literal

335
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,287
And so as I was writing this song I

336
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,103
As I made my way through the emotional

337
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,175
Story I was trying to tell I did arrive at a place where I was

338
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
I need to

339
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Give a

340
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Blue

341
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,855
The crew compartment

342
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:38,463
I was embarrassed

343
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
To say the crew compartment

344
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Breaking up

345
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
Because I felt like

346
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583
It was too little

347
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,447
And so to say the crew compartments breaking up the first time I went through and I was

348
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Let you know

349
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
But it needed it

350
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,359
The crew

351
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
And the thing was

352
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
You sing at once

353
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,599
The second time everybody gets it the third time

354
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,159
They've heard it now the 4th time they're like okay alright

355
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,975
56 time it starts to get annoying

356
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
And then a new kind of

357
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,327
Gravity enters in

358
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
7

359
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
Restart

360
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Fuel

361
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
The emotion

362
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:38,111
And when

363
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,183
When I perform at live if I'm not careful I will

364
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Start to cry.

365
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,423
Dollar Tree

366
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Bailando

367
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,519
We tried to get a little string quartet to come in

368
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,567
We ran several passes

369
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
We took that and

370
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
Play double speed

371
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:05,247
And they did their own version of this kind of swarm of bees

372
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:24,447
So we didn't have a drummer and it was like we should we get should we call that one guy because like or I could get the best drummer

373
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
Any

374
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
Producer would make that choice if he had

375
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Matt Chamberlain

376
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
And Tucker

377
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,367
And he managed to

378
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,671
Not just introduced swing into it

379
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,767
But make this piano part which on its own is very Square

380
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
And on top of the beat

381
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
And he played to it

382
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,447
Introduced swing to it

383
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,263
Played a little bit behind in a little bit

384
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,567
With this tremendous sort of

385
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,359
Breath and energy

386
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
And watching it all happen

387
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,455
Was Revelation to me as a musician

388
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,759
I understood how much I have to learn

389
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,807
So what Matt did

390
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,135
He he came in he set up his drums and he had one microphone

391
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
But he pulled out of a bag

392
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,976
Set up himself

393
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
And we all just for watching him

394
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,144
You know like you would watch a black panther that came into your kitchen looks like

395
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
What's it going to do

396
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,336
Any put the microphone in front of his drums and he was like okay you know record me

397
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:40,224
And so he plays for about a minute and then he's like play that back from Annie listens to the track

398
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,088
And then he stands up he walks around and he moves the microphone

399
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
Sit back down and says

400
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
Any plays all the way through the trash

401
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,424
And I was listening to it and going like you know I'm the songwriter and kind of the main guy here and I was like

402
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:04,032
Yeah it was pretty good I mean I got some comments

403
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,592
And here we got to the end he was like

404
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,128
Okay roll it again

405
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
You know when you didn't

406
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,968
Wait to hear any comments from the songwriter which is like

407
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
All right

408
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
He played through it again

409
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
And I was like most interesting

410
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
You know kind of variation

411
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,488
He was like give it to me again

412
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
He did that five times

413
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
And then he's like Alright

414
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
You know I'm coming into the control room

415
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
He comes and he sits down he's like okay

416
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
Can those five tracks

417
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
Hard left

418
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,520
Middle left Center

419
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,336
Middle right hard right in the order that I work

420
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,664
5 mono drum parts

421
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
And he

422
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,736
Heather Forsyth

423
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,576
That there are drum fills that start on one track

424
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,976
And continue through all five track sleep

425
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
But this was something

426
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
Truly amazing

427
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,936
Asperger's drunk and I forgot to mention he has a piece of

428
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
Rusty

429
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,056
Just attached to a clam

430
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,872
And he starts to go up to this treatment like

431
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,248
And all of that sheet metal noise

432
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,040
That she was creator

433
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,344
The whole end of the tune

434
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
Where the spaceship is

435
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Part

436
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
He was

437
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
Making that

438
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Sound on

439
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Rusty

440
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,840
He had a vision of the song that I didn't

441
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,472
You know the title of the song was

442
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
Clear

443
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
Until

444
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
Right about this point in the

445
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
Recording

446
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,152
And so then if the Commander's you know thinking aloud

447
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
Why is he telling us this

448
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:51,808
Story

449
00:23:54,368 --> 00:24:00,512
Suzhou

450
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
That's his

451
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
His Last Vow

452
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
Do you have a sense of who he was addressing

453
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
I don't

454
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
Publicly out myself as a

455
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Utopian and a

456
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
Keep on lover

457
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
Because it's not my brand

458
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:24,576
But I'm an idealist Anna and I love humanity and I imagine us as all on a

459
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,600
Together

460
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
All

461
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
With a common cause

462
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
And

463
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,024
Space exploration seems like the ultimate

464
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
Freshen up

465
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Human being

466
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
Doing their best

467
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,400
Work

468
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,728
So I imagine he is springing that back

469
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
Plus all of us

470
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
Something

471
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
If we could only

472
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
Share that

473
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
Sympathy

474
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,432
Why the hell do we go up into

475
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,480
Go up into space to bring

476
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
That little Tanner

477
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,112
Vision of the Earth being a borderless

478
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,136
Place full of

479
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Birds

480
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Boys and girl

481
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
Here's the

482
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,216
The commander thinks aloud

483
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Why the long run

484
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008

485
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:10,720

486
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:36,320

Between the beeps bongs and chatter of our devices

493
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:09,056
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

494
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
If

495
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:16,480
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

496

497
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,368
Technology talk to us

498

507

508
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,576
Makes for a much more natural experience

509
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,624

The body genius is a Dark comic mystery
