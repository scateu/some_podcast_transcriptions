Roman Mars

00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,216
If you grew up watching Warner Brothers cartoons

22
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,264
And I really really hope you did

23
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,056
You might remember seeing the words

24
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,408
Directed by Chuck Jones in big letters in the opening credits

25
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,736
Chuck Jones worked for decades

26
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,528
Cartoons like Looney Tunes

27
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,576
From the 1930s until his death

28
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
In 2002

29
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,184
In addition to being a director he was also an animator

30
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,488
Get Bugs Bunny that cocky slash

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,792
I gave Daffy Duck those mischievous eyes

32
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,864
Biting Bugs Bunny's Bar Mitzvah stack of Daffy Duck is insane

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,192
He made a mute Wylie Coyote

34

Hold up signs at commented

Kisscartoon

37
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,896
In 1996 Jones accepted an Academy Award

39
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,344
I stand guilty before the world

40
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,672
A directing over 300 cartoons the last 50 years

41
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,696
60 years

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Hopefully

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
This means you forgiven me

44
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,888
Chuck Jones is the name most people remember when they think about those cartoons

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,984
But I want to talk about another guy and artist to work with Chuck

46
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,056
A guy who wasn't just important to Looney Tunes

47
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,848
He changed the entire art

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Love animation

49
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
Yeah the amazing thing about this guy is that he never drew Bugs Bunny or Elmer Fudd or Yosemite Sam or any of those characters he threw the back

50
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Backgrounds

51
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
Behind those character

52
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,696
Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a half century

53
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
Jackie docklands on this weird futuristic

54
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Take planet

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,496
Or you know the Road Runner cartoons that jacket

56
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
Bright abstract desert

57
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
That is the work of Maurice

58
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Noble

59
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,944
You're helping us tell the story is reporter Eric molinsky

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,296
Hey Eric used to work in animation as a storyboard artist on the Rugrats

61
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,136
And a couple of other cartoons for Nickelodeon

62
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,720
So breakdown press with the layout artist does in the hole animation

63
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,840
Hartwell so today like a TV show you would start out with

64
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:21,216
Or in the case of Looney Tunes it probably did start drawing story sketches to figure out the gags

65
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
The camera angles

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Stop

67
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,800
And then before the animation starts

68
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
The background

69
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,384
Designer or layout artist has

70
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,432
First crack at drawing

71
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
This world

72
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
And those drawings are then later

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,648
Painting by someone else but you know the layout artist like Maurice Noble is really accomplished would actually have a say in in the color choices

74
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
As well

75
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,000
And so this is actually really important to imagine you're watching cartoon

76
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:48,096
Can any of the layout or they going to the background is sometimes the first image that you see it

77
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,888
Pops on screen for a second

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,216
And your brain use to instantly register Where You Are

79
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
In what mood you're supposed

80
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,336
So let's get on say watching Road Runner cartoon you cut to this

81
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Big boulder

82
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,944
Perched on top of a really high narrow cliff

83
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,272
You're going to immediately feel dread for the coyote

84
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,344
So the layout artist is kind of like the straight man in the comedy duo

85
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Setting up the gag

86
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
For the animator hygge

87
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
Funny guy right credit I mean they're literally in the background they're creating the painstaking work of

88
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Bart for somebody else

89
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
Plop their drawings right on top of it

90
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,191
So you have to keep your ego in check

91
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,383
Reasonable spent most of his career working for Warner Bros

92
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
Cadence are outdoing new wacky cartoon

93
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,015
Asian man he wanted to be a fine artist

94
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Painting desert landscape

95
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,879
When he graduated Art School Maurice found work at Walt Disney Studios

96
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,207
His first job is paying an apple and they said it was

97
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,327
Dirty toilet tedious process of exacting process of just putting the colors downgraded to match

98
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,399
You know he didn't think so at the moment but it was definitely

99
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
Pampering him creatively

100
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,751
This is Bob McKinnon who wrote a biography of Maurice Noble

101
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:05,151
He said that even though Disney feature film that is really realistic and settle background you see every leaf on a tree or the shine

102
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
Hang on a door knob

103
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
Maurice felt like he was slumming it

104
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
Squandering his talent on

105
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Commercial Art

106
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,367
1941 Disney Studios was torn apart by a strike

107
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,415
The artist wanted to create a union

108
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
In-wall took the walkout very

109
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
Very personally when it was over

110
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,071
He got rid of anyone associated with the strike

111
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
Concluding reasonable

112
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,447
I think it's a strike and not happen he said he would have had a job for life time it is

113
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,007
Dbd I think he was with a stay there forever

114
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,311
But Maurice wasn't unemployed for long

115
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,151
World War II broke out and he was drafted into a unit that made propaganda film

116
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
Is featuring a cartoon character

117
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
Name the private snafu

118
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:00,447
As you can probably tell from that phone clip which has the very distinct voice of Mel Blanc in it

119
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
The propaganda film crew

120
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
Was full of people from Warner Brothers

121
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
Including Chuck Jones

122
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
So I also talked with Todd

123
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,407
Pulse and who's working on a book about Maurice's artwork

124
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
And he's as Maurice found their style to be

125
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Liberating

126
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,551
You know everybody was involved with those

127
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:20,159
Those films for the Army definitely were able to finally Express themselves

128
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,695
And then after the war

129
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
They got Maurice a job working at Warner Brothers

130
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
Cuz I was sweating you said

131
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
No one knew

132
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,911
How little he knew about that particular end of the business and

133
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:36,287
According to him he was flying by the seat of his pants layouts before but

134
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
I'm like 30 short films per year

135
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,151
And just to give you a sense of how crazy that is

136
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:46,015
So today in OTR lease when I worked in TV going to we would ship are storyboards to create

137
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
Today they would probably

138
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
You know email them to Korea

139
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:54,719
Eyewear near cheaper labor will fill in the animation or you could use a computer base program like Flash 2

140
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
To speed up the workflow

141
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,815
And I just make 22 Episodes for a season

142
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,863
These guys are doing more work

143
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
And doing it all by hand

144
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
Unlike that first

145
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:10,079
Painstakingly realistic Apple that he painted for Disney Maurice Noble come to embrace the idea that backgrounds

146
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,639
Should be flatter and more cartoonish

147
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
More like the characters

148
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
Yeah let me like another example would be

149
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
Jungle Book and then going back to Disney

150
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,415
One of my favorite movies cuz the animation is totally amazing and it matches so beautifully the voices of those actors

151
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
I've always been bothered by the fact that

152
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,279
The characters are kind of flat in 2D

153
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,375
But the jungle is rendered with a subtle colors and Lighting in the trees

154
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,679
Three dimensional shading and I can never really

155
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,519
Suspend my disbelief that those characters are actually living in that world

156
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,335
Maurice felt the same way about Disney

157
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
Bare necessities

158
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
Forget about

159
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,527
Joe Webb

160
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
I mean

161
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,351
He always felt animation was a flat stylize medium so he wanted the background to support that

162
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,935
Then like use of airbrush you is felt the background of some of the studios were

163
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
Fighting the characters in

164
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:15,359
People talk to him and say while you were you inspired by Monday and this time he says that I don't think that way

165
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:20,223
He says you are working in a completely new medium this is a completely unique art form

166
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,343
Emory Center of changing what Warner Brothers was doing because he's pushing the cartoonist

167
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,903
Set the background until they the same sass is bug

168
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,463
Bunny or the delusional Insanity of Daffy Duck

169
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,071
Roadrunner cartoons the coyotes real antagonist isn't really the roadrunner

170
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
It's the desert landscape

171
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
The Acme Corporation

172
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
Conspiring to make his life miserable

173
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,567
The earlier cartoons that were done before I got there because

174
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:51,455
They're a little more realistic there a little more just straight ahead and went when he got there he started to use

175
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
Goldie different techniques and then

176
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
What are you called

177
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:00,671
Stop registration colors with Adelines of the the rock band lineup with color behind them

178
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,207
You said I was to give you a heat Shimmer

179
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
Which he knew all about cuz I grew up in New Mexico

180
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:09,631
PP grew up in that kind of thing you played in The Rocks me sorry I'm sure all that influenced his take on

181
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,679
On the desert when he did the Roadrunner cartoon

182
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,079
And this is how Maurice Neville becomes a hero to layout design

183
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
Remember his work is not supposed to

184
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
Detract from the character

185
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,735
Supposed to support the animation and make it

186
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Stand out

187
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
He does that brilliant

188
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
But he also developed a unique and recognizable

189
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Style

190
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,743
And it's almost like he build a stage for a show but the stage is winking at the audience

191
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
So I started animation at calarts

192
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,143
Enzo baby watching a cartoon like Duck Dodgers in the 24th and 1/2 century

193
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
And we would burst out laughing

194
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,031
Because Daffy Duck Atlanta non-plan attacks and Marie cedron.

195
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Clouds in the trees in the shape of

196
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Giant Exeter

197
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,919
I'll just bet that if we follow those planets

198
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
How do I do it

199
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,791
As Noble as coming into his own he's starting to get co-director credit on some of the phone

200
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,863
But Chuck Jones is still reaping most of the Acclaim

201
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
Todd Olson wanted Maurice's protege

202
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Says that

203
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
This became a point of tension between them in the six

204
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
Cease when they're working at MGM

205
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,335
It was a working relationship

206
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,407
And I became more and more strained as

207
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Chuck

208
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,503
Became more successful especially in the 60s

209
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,343
And in that came to a head when they made on the line

210
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
Did on the line with an adaptation of a children's book

211
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
And it was about a

212
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
Ted.

213
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,767
That falls in love with a line

214
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,815
And it's a story of their Romance

215
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:47,423
I talked to Hans with the director on the short but he was having trouble figuring out how to adapt it

216
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,471
City Executives Montgomery

217
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Well

218
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
If you don't involve Chuck

219
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,103
I can make this work for you

220
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,967
It's so Chuck brought the stuff and threw it down on his desk and stomped out

221
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,271
Andries wouldn't show up as working on

222
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
Once upon a time there was a sin

223
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
Straight line

224
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
Who is hopelessly in love

225
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
With it.

226
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:21,215
You're the beginning and the end The Hobbit all the contestants

227
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
Cut the frivolous.

228
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,823
Wasn't a bit interested

229
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,687
Precio lyrics for wild and unkempt squiggle

230
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,759
Never seem to have anything on his mind

231
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
Charming film

232
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,975
It's probably the most personal of all of Maurice's films because it's really

233
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,791
Just him on the screen is pure Graphics there's no

234
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
Classic characters that you might

235
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,679
My think of them is just dots lines is purely abstract

236
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
But really beautiful

237
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
The film is is this

238
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
Pure distillation of Maurice's work

239
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,431
And he's telling a story creating emotions in humor with just basic shapes

240
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Colors

241
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
But talk to on Cell. Direct

242
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
Credit

243
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
Of course

244
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
It won the Oscar

245
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
But he said that the

246
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
Didn't

247
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:16,255
Everything came and Todd says that even though everyone knew it was Maurice's film

248
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,047
Maurice wasn't invited

249
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
The Oscars

250
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,655
Search up Jones and Maurice Noble kept working together they worked on How the Grinch Stole

251
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
Christmas in a bunch of other

252
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
Dr. Seuss adaptation

253
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,519
But they fell out of touch for about 20 years

254
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
Until the early 1990s

255
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,151
When Warner Brothers reunited them to make cartoons that play before feature

256
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
Your films

257
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,247
They hired a bunch of young artists who just graduated from calarts

258
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
And one of them with Scott Morris

259
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,111
Maurice Noble Maurice Noble where do you where do I know that from

260
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,487
So it's because it was one of the names that preceded directed by Charles M Jones on all of

261
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,303
The cartoons that I grew up watching every day of my life

262
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,655
One of the first lessons that Scott learn was that Maurice's fantastic backgrounds were not

263
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,727
Invented out of thin air Maurice did a ton of research

264
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,055
Everything he exaggerated was based on something in the real world

265
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
You get an assignment like

266
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
Oh you know

267
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
Bugs Bunny Cindy stuck on a desert island

268
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
Thoracic on the jungle

269
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
So they should be palm trees and should be all this stuff

270
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
Okay great

271
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
And I come back with a drill with a

272
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:19,231
Withdrawing any do I put is this and I'm like their pomp reasons like those are stuck as what were you looking at and it's like a will there's a pump.

273
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
You got to learn your trees

274
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:27,423
But Murray's wasn't really that Gruff after work he talked to these twenty-two-year-old animators like he was just one of the guys

275
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
Maybe like

276
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
Let's go let's go to baseball

277
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
Let's go do this other thing you know

278
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
Would you go to museum

279
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,359
Pretty soon you realize he's more like your grandpa

280
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
Who

281
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
It's just a really cool guy to hang out with

282
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,247
The Scott Morris mystery Novartis became known as the noble

283
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:46,623
And Maurice push them to develop their own style but his sensibility really seeped into their work

284
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,719
Scott is at Pixar now which is the home of 3D animation

285
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Is the complete opposite of

286
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,303
You know the flat Landscapes of Looney Tune

287
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,887
But you can really see Maurices influence on the Pixar films

288
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
If you look for it

289
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
Like the song

290
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Think about that

291
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,871
How scary by a massive amount of balloons and lands on the very edge of a cliff and Wally.

292
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
Cute little robot is scooting around these big

293
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
Menacing towers of garbage

294
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
Yeah those are layouts that make you smile

295
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
That's good

296
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
Classic Maurice

297
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,511
In May of 2001 the noble boys were reunited one last

298
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,863
We all got another call to Maurice he was in the Hospice place me at home

299
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,167
It was just natural causes that he that he was

300
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,495
Dino that he was pretty sure you know everybody's pretty sure that that night was going to

301
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,079
Maybe be the last night we all came over and hung out with him

302
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
And Chuck Jones did call them

303
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,455
I remember being in the room with Maurice and somebody brought in the phone as I checked on the phone

304
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Colin Morris is like okay I'll

305
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,319
I'll talk to him and we all know for a fact they hadn't really talked

306
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,879
4 months if not a couple years at that point

307
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,487
And I just heard Maurice's side of the conversation but you know you could definitely tell that they were

308
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
They put everything behind on their fur

309
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
You know it was nice

310
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,119
And I did again I don't know exactly what

311
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,167
Chuck said on the other end of that line but

312
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
With a very sweet

313
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,751
Mama to be able to see that

314
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,591
And know that people could go through a lot together in life and still

315
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
I respect for you

316
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Up to the last

317
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
And

318
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,735
Kind of celebrate what they had created together

319
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,063
To some extent Marisol the noble boys is his real Legacy

320
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,647
He was proud of the fact that they had blossomed into well-rounded artist

321
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,255
If Maurice could leave behind this idea in other people to do their own thing

322
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
We would never be in the

323
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,839
Backgrounds like he was

324
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,887
But it was a beautiful

325
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
Beautiful back

326
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
I actually met Maurice number once

327
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
Oh yeah yeah

328
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:44,127
Hey I went to calarts and I came in her class on it like a Monday night

329
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
And I had

330
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
Having a Godly offer the day before

331
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
The Weeknd

332
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,831
And I was thinking about how often those guys made fun of opera on their cartoons

333
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,975
Little buddy

334
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
And I asked him

335
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,911
Did you guys actually go to the author regularly or

336
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
Weirdest kind of making fun of it as a sort of

337
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
You know highfalutin cultural Institution

338
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
And

339
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
He asked me

340
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,871
What opera did you see

341
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
And I said

342
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
La Traviata

343
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
And he said

344
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Violetta

345
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
A Gatsby

346
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,111
And that is a man who knew a good day

347
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Funny song

348
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:45,055
99% invisible with produce this week by Eric molinsky with Sam Greenspan and me Roman more

349
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,919
We are product of 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco

350
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
In the American Inn

351
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Institute of Architects

352
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
Sex in San

353
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,855
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

354
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
We're immersed

355
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,439
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

356
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
If

357

Nothing to do with it

408
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
