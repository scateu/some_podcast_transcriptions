This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars

20
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,160
So I think we're at

21
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:37,280
And this is Radio producer Sean Cole in New York City this is a reenactment

22
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,328
We're just going to lay this out the way it happen

23
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm here with my friend Melissa

24
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,448
At the Hudson River on the piers where we were

25
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,240
Exactly a year ago

26
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,520
Walking along

27
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
You know casually

28
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
Pretty drunk

29
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
We were

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
Drunk talking about poetry

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,248
As you do when it's late and you're in a part of town you never been before

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
And it feels like anything could happen

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,184
Spontaneously Melissa asked Sean to read her a poem

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,976
By the late great Frank O'Hara

35
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,792
Is it dirty or before

36
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
Does it look

37
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,936
Dirty joke around with him everywhere that's what you think of in the city

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,008
Does it just seem

39
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
Dirty

40
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:26,432
That's what you think of in the city you don't refuse to breathe do you

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
Someone

42
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:33,344
Sean's a huge O'Hara fan which we can report in about 2 minutes anyway they kept walking

43
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:40,256
And walking again until finally they wind up in a little Plaza is it frame by 2

44
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,840
Decorative fences with an opening between them two fences

45
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,680
They hung out there for maybe 20 minutes not noticing anything

46
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:52,288
And then we kept walking to keep on going and I went Sears words

47
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
If I remembered me being those words

48
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,432
Words in one of the fences

49
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,784
I said like we not carved or inscribed into it

50
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,600
It says something but wrought

51
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,160
In the very middle of

52
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
The fence

53
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
It says

54
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,280
Contraband

55
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
Uwosh ins

56
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
Shear

57
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,656
City

58
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Of

59
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,264
The sea

60
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,848
City movie of Wars reading

61
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:31,456
And stores were biwer city of tall

62
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Facade

63
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,552
Of Marvel and iron

64
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
Rad

65
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
And

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
Passionate

67
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
City

68
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,000
Meddlesome mad

69
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Extra

70
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,936
Again extravagant City Walt Whitman was a passage from another poem

71
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
And a big influence

72
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
On Frank O'Hara Walt Whitman

73
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,152
They run back to the beginning of the sentence starts over here in the fence

74
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Fentons

75
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
City of the world for all races are here all the lands of the Earth make on

76
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:15,744
City of the sea city of wharves at stores

77
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,047
City of Tulsa sod

78
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,631
Marble and iron proud and passionate City

79
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
Meddlesome

80
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,983
Extravagant

81
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
City

82
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,567
Holy crap it's Fresno Fair

83
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
That's right the second fence

84
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,991
Is forged into a line by Frank O'Hara

85
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
Liquors like this

86
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,111
One need never leave the confines of New York

87
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
To get all the greenery one wishes I can't even enjoy a blade of grass and less I know there's a Subway handy

88
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
Play or record store

89
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,935
Some other sign that people do not totally Regret Life people do not

90
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,727
Totally Regret Life

91
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:05,407
It's from O'Hara's poem meditations in an emergency if you're a Madman fan you probably heard of it

92
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,991
Sean bent down and scooped his brains up off the concrete

93
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
You have to understand

94
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
I

95
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
That is why I write poems

96
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
And

97
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,927
You know poetry is just never

98
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
Treated

99
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
With this kind of

100
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
Reverence

101
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
And

102
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:28,703
Architectural permanents do you know what I mean it's like it's like you don't know

103
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,567
I mean like you see that little like poetry in motion placards on the subway and that's

104
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Nice

105
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
This

106
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Is like

107
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
The

108
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:44,319
The balusters of the fence that look that word up this the spokes of the fence come down

109
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,903
And bend around each letter and it sort of

110
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:53,279
Hug each letter each letter is painted gold

111
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
And then like

112
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
Oh wait

113
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
It's these two poets

114
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
With

115
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:05,567
Whom I have like an entire life of obsession I mean like I wrote I promise I'm

116
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:10,175
Uncle on 250 pages

117
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
Of

118
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
Academic

119
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,855
Gobbledygook about Whitman for part of my my college thesis

120
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,511
And O'Hara is like my poetry boyfriend like I'm just like

121
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
I like I thought he was my

122
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,959
I'll let you know what I mean like you have those like artists that you carry around with you in there like you've heard of him you know

123
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,751
And

124
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
So like to see him a

125
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,199
You know rotten metal you know she's one thing and be rotten metal

126
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Next

127
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
2

128
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
The poet

129
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,063
Shio herisau is like

130
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,159
Is Gandhi called him like my great predecessors his big influence

131
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,975
It was the last

132
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
Thing I expected to encounter

133
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
That night

134
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
And I'm glad we went back because

135
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
It occurred to us

136
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Sitting there

137
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
This time

138
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
You know I bet it's dated someone

139
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
And I bet there's a date on it

140
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
Yeah in fact

141
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
It says

142
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
The Plaza

143
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
Caesar

144
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
Kelly and it's pelli

145
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,135
Scott Burton

146
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
Sia

147
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
Parmigiani

148
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
And M Paul

149
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Friedberg

150
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
1989

151
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
We definitely did not see

152
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
I looked them up

153
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,271
Cesar pelli is one of the most influential architects in the world

154
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,671
Scott Burns an artist he died of AIDS in 1989 CRV Johnny is alive he's another artist living

155
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Minnesota

156
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,231
And M Paul Friedberg

157
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,607
Impala Freebirds office is down the street from my apartment in Manhattan

158
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
4

159
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,799
Turns out he's really one of the forerunners of urban landscape design

160
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,871
We sat down for 15 or 20 minutes

161
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
Which quickly became almost an hour

162
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
In part because of this whole

163
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Homeric

164
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
Feud behind the building of this fence

165
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
You ready yes no Marathon Iowa

166
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:32,511
Okay suit Cesar pelli was the main architect for the entire Plaza

167
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,327
And he tapped our guy Friedberg as his Consulting

168
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
And I was very pleased

169
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,959
Normally after the design was built

170
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
You would find places

171
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
For the art

172
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
To be located

173
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
And then you would go out

174
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,663
And select the artist that you wanted

175
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,783
Now that would that is deep traditional historically the traditional way

176
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
I hear a but

177
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,159
But this time someone else was calling the shots

178
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
Planning official basically

179
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,119
How to get members name I'm sorry anyway this official comes along and says we want you guys to work with an artist

180
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
And the architecture lecture course

181
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
But then the official goes

182
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,007
Now you don't quite understand

183
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
We want you to use an artist

184
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:22,431
As a co-equal member of the design team

185
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,527
The artist or going to have just as much control as the architect

186
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
That's too that was unheard of

187
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
It was really unheard of exactly

188
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,463
Architects in general or war on Happy

189
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
Will taking away

190
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,535
An assignment of Pisa

191
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,351
The Architects have always had

192
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Richard

193
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Car is the guys

194
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,935
Richard Conte

195
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:50,335
Former head of the Battery Park City Authority which control this project

196
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
You don't quite understand

197
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,455
That's the way it's going to be

198
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
Whether you work on or not

199
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,831
Okay

200
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,231
So the artist were chosen as usual through a competition

201
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,327
The fait accompli for you guys absolutely we were handed these two guys

202
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,655
Sia Army Johnny and Scott Burton the two other names on the plaque

203
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
So they're both artists

204
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
And Scott

205
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,799
Happened to be acquainted with Frank O'Hara

206
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:25,407
We met them for the first time I would like you to come up with a

207
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
I want to plant

208
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,271
Tori Kelly

209
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Hostile environment

210
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,647
Buying each other suspiciously

211
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,999
Knew what the others were saying about each other and and how badly

212
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,071
And just you know each didn't want the other to be involved

213
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
And it wasn't going to get it was on principal

214
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
So

215
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,471
I just left him a lot of close the door left

216
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
Call me when you have something to show

217
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
We met once and they were

218
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
Replacement three times

219
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
And began to develop

220
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Trusting each other

221
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,063
They fell in love with each other

222
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
And the rules are important

223
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
If any of us

224
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Therefore

225
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
If any of

226
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Anyone of us

227
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
Did not want

228
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Peak design

229
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
Supposed

230
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Of the other three

231
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
It had to be discarded

232
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
Time to do the

233
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Defense

234
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
She is idea

235
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,687
Not Scotty

236
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,271
It was primarily see his idea that

237
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
Because it was part of his

238
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
Seeds from a Ron

239
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
More poetry is actually

240
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:46,047
Not mocked openly one need never leave the confines of New York to get all the greenery 1 wishes

241
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,887
Usually selected the quote not the rest of us I can't

242
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:54,495
Even enjoy a blade of grass unless I know there's a Subway handy

243
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:01,151
Read then took Sears idea or a record store and made it work physically or some other sign

244
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
In the fence

245
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,271
That's my job in this that people do not totally Regret Life

246
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
So I called see Army Johnny

247
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,511
And he didn't want to be interviewed for the radio

248
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
He did however want to go out for coffee sometime and talk about poetry

249
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
He said

250
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,703
Many people many Poets of what was known as the New York school of poetry

251
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,567
Call him after the fence was unveiled to thank him

252
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,151
You're such a wonderful tribute to their friend and colleague Frank O'Hara

253
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,991
O'Hara sister Maureen called theratears he said

254
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
To thank him

255
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
I just wanted

256
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
To be in touch with

257
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
This

258
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Is Maureen O'Hara

259
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
Can I just say how electrocuting it is to talk with someone who shares the same genetic material as your personal massage

260
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,887
Your brother is my favorite

261
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
It's true

262
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,823
She said she loved the idea from when they first mailed her the design on paper

263
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
Sent me a 1980

264
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,687
And when she finally saw it in the Flash

265
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Absolutely

266
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
Lighted

267
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
It was a baby

268
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Blistering

269
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,855
Plus just aesthetically she said

270
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:18,207
Thing is brilliant and the letters are formed

271
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,791
Heading to the railing and how they shine and they

272
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
Really must have been

273
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
Quite a surprise

274
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
Steelers today

275
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
I feel the same way

276
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Anne Frank

277
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Loved it

278
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
So much Justice

279
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
If he loves collaborating

280
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:39,199
You know I mean it because really is in the spirit of it

281
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Collabera

282
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
Collaborative

283
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Do not get this

284
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,463
I know I was that's why I was so shocked I'm like not only is it

285
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,791
Poetry but it's Walt Whitman and Frank O'Hara I feel like that's a deep

286
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
Cut and like

287
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,887
I know you don't normally poetry so

288
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,447
Either maligned or ignored

289
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,567
And it was it's a wonderful for Walt Whitman I mean let's not forget

290
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
It would just be

291
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
Such a thrill

292
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,479
But to me I think poetry one I think I should be poetry should be in

293
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
Indoor gardens did I park

294
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,831
Michigan is M Paul Friedberg bikes

295
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,695
And this actually Taps into a major design principle of his I think information

296
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Should be layered in the

297
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
In our environment

298
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Information information

299
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,607
Should be late cultural information

300
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
It should be layered in the environment

301
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
Not a doctor

302
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
It should be an integral part

303
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
When I say layered

304
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,103
That if you are interest

305
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
You extract

306
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
A wall

307
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Structural

308
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Anthony

309
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
How do you express

310
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
That

311
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
It has

312
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
Force it has

313
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
Power

314
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,671
That's a very important part to the way you designed the wall

315
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,999
But then again the wall is also a billboard

316
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Okay

317
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
So how do you then

318
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
Express what kind of probation

319
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,655
Do you express on a billboard

320
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,727
Can be decorative that can be color write him anything right

321
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
Like that

322
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,591
The idea that you looking at offense and yet you walk away

323
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
With the thought

324
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
As well

325
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
United defense is a barrier

326
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,783
So you really want me to have like a contradiction here

327
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,087
Break the barrier

328
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Okay

329
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Poetry breaks

330
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
The barrier

331
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
The idea that

332
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
Doesn't stop you

333
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
It begins some

334
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Yeah

335
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,911
I'm making that up as I go as I go

336
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
So what are you end up with all this

337
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Itsfunneh

338
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,919
Melissa nice to have the same thought about it

339
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
When we went back

340
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:53,855
Again for the second visit this time about like Whitman and O'Hara sort of looking down on the

341
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Trump

342
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Someplace

343
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,231
Cioppino

344
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
I mean I don't even know if I believe in

345
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,863
The afterlife but it would be cool if they knew

346
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,543
It wouldn't it really would be I think about that all the time

347
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Really

348
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,127
Yeah it would especially be cool for

349
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Troy O'Hara

350
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,503
And it really makes me want to

351
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
Go back in time

352
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
And say to Frank O'Hara

353
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
It's going to be okay

354
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Cuz one day

355
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Align

356
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
From a poem

357
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,327
That you wrote War in fact that you may have yet to write

358
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
Will be

359
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,167
Ensconced in bronze

360
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
In a

361
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
Fence

362
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,263
In New York City

363
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,079
Next to align by Walt Whitman

364
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
So don't worry

365
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,223
If somebody came and said that to me

366
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
I think I'd

367
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,599
I think I died you know

368
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
Feel a lot better

369
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
Then I usually do

370
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:13,215
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Shawn Cole Melissa O'Donnell and me Roman

371
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
Two gay poets to a minor it's a project of kalw

372
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:24,479
Local public radio in San Francisco and the American Institute of Architects in San Francisco

373
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:30,879
