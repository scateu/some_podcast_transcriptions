The New York Financial the

32
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
In the shadows of glass skyscraper

33
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,328
You definitely don't feel like you're at the seaside

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,240
But had a few blocks south and suddenly you're at the edge of the continent

35
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
Looking out at the water

36
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
That's pretty sure Emmett Fitzgerald

37
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,128
There are ducks and seagulls

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,944
Ferry boats ready to take you Island top

39
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:03,392
Writer Paul Greenberg moved into an apartment down here over a decade

40
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
And up until that point

41
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,024
Like a lot of New Yorkers I didn't really pay that much attention

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
To the Sea

43
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,096
If I want to go to the ocean I would go to

44
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
Marthas vineyard Long Island

45
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,472
But then he started noticing all these Maritime building

46
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,520
Like the old Fulton Fish

47
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
Where fishermen used to sell their catch to rest

48
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
I certainly was her to confront with the fact that

49
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,992
New York Manhattan is really a very buccini kind of place

50
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,088
Greenberg actually writes about the ocean for a living

51
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,648
His most recent book is called American Cash

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,256
And he started to research the relationship between New York City and the sea

53
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,656
But then in 2012 something happened that made that relationship impossible to ignore

54
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
Hurricane Sandy

55
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
Crashing on shore

56
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,288
Winds now at 90 miles per hour and this

57
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,080
The storm is so big so bad

58
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
60 million America

59
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
Ken's will philia

60
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,552
Power just take a look out here that is the Brooklyn Bridge and look at how those

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,112
Are whipping the river around

62
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:11,744
Hurricane Sandy storm surge inundated neighborhoods throughout New York City

63
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
See water poured into the street

64
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,608
Putting out apartment buildings and filling the subway tunnels

65
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,216
Greenberg and his family waited out the storm in their tent floor apart

66
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,056
We sat there in the storm hit and things started to rock and roll

67
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:30,944
Then everything went black Sandy knocked out power across lower Manhattan

68
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,552
The day after I immediately wanted to get a sense of what it was like

69
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
So he walked down to the water

70
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
Passed a bunch of bars and rest

71
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
And when you

72
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
Peered in the windows

73
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
It looked as if there'd been a horrible bar fight

74
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
Because the water come in

75
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,864
Flooded up to eight or nine feet

76
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,936
Have thrown all the chairs and tables up in the air

77
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,312
But as he surveyed the damage Greenberg also started to notice things about his neighborhood

78
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
That he never had

79
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,920
Turns out that Broadway and I live on Broadway

80
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
Is it Ridgeline

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,248
It's the high point between east and west

82
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
And when

83
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
Hurricane Sandy hit

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
Lower Manhattan

85
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,904
Safer and safer and dryer and dryer

86
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
Closer You Are

87
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Broadway

88
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,863
He says the storm forced New Yorkers to see the relationship between their City

89
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Much more intimate way

90
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
Nothing acquaints you

91
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,239
With your city's topography like

92
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
Living in the eye of a hurricane

93
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,639
And feeling that water flow up in and rise up and literally start to swallow the city

94
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,575
Sandy took the lives of over 100 people in the United States and cause upwards of fifty billion dollars in damage

95
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,903
Who's the second most expensive storm in US history

96
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
Are the reason why the storm was so destructive

97
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Has to do with climate change

98
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:53,375
Scientists have calculated that because of sea level rise driven by climate change

99
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,959
Sandy flooded in additional 27 square miles

100
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
Unaffected 83000 more

101
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
Then it would have otherwise

102
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
There is a wake-up call here

103
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
And there's a lesson

104
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
He learned

105
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
This is Governor Andrew Cuomo

106
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
Speaking in the storm's aftermath

107
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,551
There's a reality that has existed for a long time

108
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
That we've been blind

109
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
And that is

110
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Climate change

111
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
Extreme weather

112
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Call apus

113
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,023
Do well in our vulnerability

114
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,839
It's undeniable but that the

115
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Frequency of a

116
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
Extreme weather conditions

117
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
It's going to be a

118
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
Rethinking

119
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,311
Redesign of how we protect

120
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,127
This metropolitan area from this increased

121
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Frequency

122
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
Architects and Engineers are looking at different ways that cities like New York and redesign their interest

123
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
To prepare for more extreme Storm surges

124
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
There's talk of floodgates

125
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,279
Massive sea wall across the entire Harbor

126
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
But Paul Greenberg says that

127
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
One of the Soul

128
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
Solutions for New York's future

129
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
Might lie in it

130
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,007
Will Sasso New York

131
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,311
In its natural state was set up

132
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,359
To deal with big storms

133
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,687
New York was built at the mouth of the Hudson River

134
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:15,039
In that fertile Estuary environment was filled with all kinds of marine life

135
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,111
1 Majestic creature in particular

136
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
Shape the landscape

137
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,951
Decimated probably in the trillions

138
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
Avoid stirrers surrounded New York City

139
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
Before European colonization

140
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,375
We now think of as the New York City Harbor

141
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,423
Was a veritable oyster Kingdom

142
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,263
Some scientists think it contain nearly half the world's oysters

143
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,079
And they were an important part of the ecosystem

144
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
Oysters are filter feeders

145
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,687
And they help keep bacteria levels in check

146
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,015
And in addition to their ability to filter the water

147
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
Oyster student huge amount

148
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
To buffer the city against

149
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Storm surges

150
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,951
Because oysters are kind of special

151
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
They are unique among

152
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,583
Mollusks in that they build in three dimensions

153
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,887
So there really architects in a sense

154
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,959
Oysters like to grow on top of other oyster

155
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,775
Actually since the chemical basicness

156
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
Oyster shell

157
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
And they will see directly on top of other waster so you get these aggregations these clumps that build build build

158
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,295
Belt eventually they build up into massive complex restructure

159
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
Kind of like coral reef

160
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,879
Oysters really are

161
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
The coral reefs

162
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
List of temperate zone

163
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,791
Oyster East covered over 220 thousand acres

164
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
The Hudson River St

165
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,399
And sometimes they grew as high is 20 ft tall

166
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,471
Like coral reefs they cut down on Coastal erosion

167
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,031
And we're home to all different kinds of fish

168
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,127
And just as coral reefs help protect many Tropical Islands from Hurricane

169
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
Oysters protected New York City

170
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,503
They broke up large waves before they could crash onto the shore

171
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Below the surface

172
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,343
The rough texture would increase friction

173
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
Slow down the water

174
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
And so annoyed her wreath

175
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,463
Spread out over many miles

176
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
Well actually

177
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,071
Seth the wave energy of waves passing over it

178
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,143
Most people don't associate New York City with oysters today

179
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,935
The back in the 1700s

180
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
They were what New York was known for

181
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,519
Oysters

182
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,359
We're absolutely Central to the identity of New York

183
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,967
You know if somebody were to say I'm going to New York that would say Enjoy the oyster

184
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
This is Mark kurlansky

185
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
Author of many books

186
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,623
Including an environmental history of New York City called

187
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
Big oyster

188
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:32,511
Kurlansky says that before colonization indigenous Lenape

189
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
People a lot

190
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,351
And when the Dutch arrived in the area

191
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,399
They found an oyster Paradise

192
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,471
You could just walk down to the shore anywhere

193
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,519
Certainly in lower Manhattan

194
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,055
Where everybody was living but

195
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
Anywhere

196
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
And

197
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
You don't break off a few Isis

198
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,967
And that's exactly what they did

199
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
Everybody in New York

200
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
Oysters

201
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,879
It was said that the only thing the poor people ever got to eat with oysters and bread

202
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
But it was also something that rich people

203
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,743
How do unusual in food history to have

204
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,327
The rich people food in the poor people food be the same at

205
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Same time

206
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,167
Oysters were sold in Street carts and Bar

207
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,959
But also fancy restaurant

208
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,775
And they were served in all different kinds of ways

209
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,615
I was there were lots of things they were like oyster loaves

210
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
Send

211
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
Oysters with different kinds of

212
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,503
Sauces and they were oyster stews

213
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
Discarded oyster shells piled up in

214
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,391
Huge Mounds outside of shocking houses in restaurants

215
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
They were so plentiful

216
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,999
That Builders began using oysters as construction material

217
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,327
Shows were burned crate lime ground up for Mortar

218
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
Were used to pave streets

219
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,423
Prince's Pearl Street in lower Manhattan

220
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Call Pearl Street

221
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
Originally paved with crushed oyster shells

222
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,407
The demand for oysters was so great that it eventually out

223
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,455
Scripps New York's Bountiful Supply

224
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,039
The Erie Canal and the railroad opened up new market

225
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,903
Well nature could not produce enough oysters for the all the place

226
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
Shipping

227
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,743
A lot of places it was more than the natural bed

228
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Provide

229
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,375
By the mid-1800s New York natural oyster population had been depleted

230
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,727
Humans had nearly eaten the city's protective shellfish barrier out of existence

231
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
But that wasn't the end of oysters in New York

232
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:26,943
When I started to run out of oysters in New York city seed from the Chesapeake Bay

233
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,247
And they planted these baby oysters

234
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
On Long rope

235
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,343
Strong in Rose throughout the shallows at the harbor

236
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
Farming oysters works

237
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,951
Quite well and it is kind of the next launch

238
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
Magical staff

239
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,071
Need more oysters than grow there with nature you just grow some of yourself

240
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,655
Oyster farming continue throughout the 19th century

241
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,775
And by the 1880s the city was producing over 700 million oysters per year

242
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,335
But there was a problem lurking in the water

243
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
4 years

244
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:01,247
City had been dumping industrial pollutants and sewage straight into the harbor without a second thought

245
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,647
It didn't seem to register with people that dumping raw sewage on a food supply would be unhealthy

246
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
It seems sort of intuitive to me

247
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
They didn't really they didn't worry about that

248
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,887
That is until the early 1900's when New York was hit with deadly outbreaks

249
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
Cholera and typhoid

250
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,263
Public Health officials were able to track the disease is back

251
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
The source

252
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,615
Turned out that most of these epidemics are coming from

253
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,711
And so one by one the city started shutting down the Oyster Bay

254
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
Which was really upset

255
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
Setting for New Yorkers

256
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
It was huge

257
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,879
Front Page News every time they closed

258
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Oyster Bay

259
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,207
And there be all these articles

260
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
About how we have

261
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
To do something about this

262
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
We're losing

263
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
Heritage

264
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,095
Lucy hair oysters

265
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
We have to stop this

266
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
I think somehow

267
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Didn't get it stop

268
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,711
New York closed its last remaining oysterband off the south coast of Staten Island in 1927

269
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,039
Water quality continue to deteriorate until oysters

270
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
Could no longer survive

271
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,671
Water was so acidic it would actually actually through the shelves

272
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:19,071
By the middle of the twentieth century New York's world famous oysters were all but gone

273
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
Leading the sea bottom bearing

274
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
And the City

275
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
Exposed

276
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,103
Pollution continues to be a problem in New York but in 1972 Congress passed the Clean Water Act

277
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,919
Which regulated the waste being dumped into waterways

278
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,015
And little by little water quality in the harbor has improved

279
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
Now oxygen levels are high enough

280
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
Sports shelter so theoretically

281
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
We could have shellfish again

282
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,463
Throughout the day this is Paul Greenberg

283
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
In his book American catch

284
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:54,143
She documents several different groups who are working really hard to try and bring back the New York oyster

285
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,471
There are a lot of obstacles in their way including

286
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,287
FDA rules which makes it really hard to plan toys

287
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
And the fact that they're just

288
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,407
Isn't enough wild oyster larvae in the water anyway

289
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,015
The biggest challenges is actually an architectural

290
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Because

291
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,623
The physical landscape of the harbor has totally changed

292
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
We've been dredging the harbor

293
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Turn over

294
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
150 years now

295
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
I went

296
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
From an average depth

297
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,071
20 ft two places where

298
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
Now it's more than 50 ft

299
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,167
And the bottom looks very different

300
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
Right now our Harbor has a

301
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
Flat Muddy Bottom

302
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:36,639
But you know if you were to look at say 1850 1880 this would have been

303
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,711
Extremely kind of rough ER

304
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,503
Three dimensional mosaic

305
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
This is Kate orff

306
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,367
She's a landscape architect and founder of the firm skate

307
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
Beast in Manhattan

308
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,231
And she is the author of the new book towards an Urban Ecology

309
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,583
She also just became the first landscape architect to win a MacArthur genius award

310
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00,447
An orc says that a flat Muddy Bottom just does not work well for

311
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Oysters

312
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
There's no places are very few places for oysters to grab onto and to attack

313
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,967
Right now there's some oyster larvae floating around out there

314
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
But they don't really stand a chance

315
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
Any oyster that

316
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,903
Lands on the bottom of the base bed will then immediately be covered with soap

317
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Do we need to

318
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:27,071
Lift those oysters off of the bay floor and we need to provide substrate for these creature

319
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
Pictures to attach onto

320
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,727
That challenge gave orphan idea that spawned one of my favorite portmantos

321
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
Oyster tecture

322
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,847
The concept was to build giant Nets made of fuzzy Marine rope

323
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,151
And Elevate them off the seafloor

324
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
They would then see the net

325
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,759
Oyster larvae and let the oysters grow from there

326
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:51,391
So it agglomerates in the sense of becoming a mega structure at Scales up out of

327
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,439
Very small organisms

328
00:14:54,463 --> 00:15:00,351
With a relatively small architectural intervention you could have a new piece of protective interest

329
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
An artificial oyster

330
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
Which in turn would

331
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
Filter the water

332
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,079
Slow the water and create a safer relationship with that water

333
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:16,991
Kate orff debuted her oyster texture proposal in 2010 as part of an exhibit at the Museum of Modern

334
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,783
Art called Rising currents

335
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,343
And it was a speculative

336
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
Check that sparked a ton of conversation

337
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
But it was never actually built

338
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:33,119
Did Hurricane Sandy brought new attention to sea-level rise and open new funding avenues for Coastal resilience projects

339
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,471
In 2013 the federal government launched its Hurricane Sandy rebuilding task force

340
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
States in architectural competition

341
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
Call rebuild by Design

342
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
Escape

343
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,383
Kate Works Architecture Firm

344
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,223
Submitted an oyster Centric proposal called living Breakwater

345
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,087
Receive $69 at funding and will be carried out for the governor's office

346
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
The storm recovery

347
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,255
Nailscape is in the process of Designing artificial oyster Reef break Waters off the south coast of Staten Island

348
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,583
Staten Island was particularly hard hit by Hurricane Sandy

349
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
This is Gina worth

350
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
Another one of the Architects from scape

351
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
Explaining the choice of location

352
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,263
And the wave action from The Surge

353
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,847
Landed right on Staten Island and really dramatically impacted

354
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
The plan.

355
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:21,503
Staten Island was also one of the epicenters of New York historic oyster economy

356
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,807
So it's it's not the first time

357
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,367
That people have been trying to

358
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,695
Cultivate and expand oysters within the bay

359
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,863
You know hundreds of years ago they were doing it for food production and today we're trying to do it for a more robust and resilient

360
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Shoreline

361
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:43,775
The design has evolved a lot from The Original Oyster texture Proposal with the Marine rope

362
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,127
The plan now is to build a necklace of offshore Breakwater

363
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
Out of large Rock

364
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,479
A special material called Eco concrete

365
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
Which shellfish like to grow on

366
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,831
They will then see the breakwaters with oysters

367
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
So they grow into reefs

368
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:03,743
Much like a natural oyster Reef the living breakwaters are designed to slow down the water

369
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,047
And break up dangerous waves

370
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Before they reach

371
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,887
The shore as the oysters grow a really help

372
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,959
Add fractions the water column and and break waves

373
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,055
The living breakwaters should reduce Coastal erosion

374
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
Build up Beach

375
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,127
And make storms last names

376
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:27,295
Modeling by scientists at the Stevens Institute has shown that the breakwaters could have reduced the height of waves during

377
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
By 326 ft

378
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,183
But they won't keep flood water out of Staten Island all together

379
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
And they're not meant to

380
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,023
Breakwater's let the water through

381
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,911
We can reduce the wave action we can reduce the intensity and the velocity of that water

382
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
But we live in a coastal Edge

383
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:49,055
And wants to design a way to make that Coastal Edge safer and healthier

384
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,615
Both for humans and for marine life

385
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,687
In addition to reducing waves and filtering the water

386
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,735
The living breakwaters will provide

387
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,551
Some of the habitats that oyster reefs once did

388
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,719
Staten Island historical mysteries were filled with all these nooks and crannies were juvenile fish like to hide

389
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,023
With the help of marine biologist

390
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
The architect's design pocket

391
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
It's within the Breakwater structure

392
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
They call them Reef Street

393
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,191
So within the reef Street

394
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,287
Juvenile Fisher able to come into these kind of underwater canyon

395
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
And feed in the street

396
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,151
And shelter and hide from predators in the structure

397
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
Where says that as a landscape architect

398
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
I think your clients are usually people

399
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,831
But we're also trying to think about who are our underwater clients

400
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:38,463
Who are the fish species that might use the system like

401
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
If you are a fish swimming in the water

402
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
What would look like a safe

403
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:46,655
Play like a totally different mentality to have when designing than what a person looks for

404
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,055
Construction hasn't begun yet on the physical structure of the Breakwater

405
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,127
But some of the oysters are already growing

406
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,759
Nightwish is growing over here

407
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
This is Asia Salgado

408
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
A recent graduate of the New York Harbor

409
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,183
On Governors Island

410
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,303
The Harbour School runs a program called the billion oyster project

411
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,375
Which aims to restore oysters throughout the harbor

412
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,471
And in the process teach young New Yorkers all about the Marine

413
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,799
Asia is standing next to a tank

414
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,335
Filled with white shell

415
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,383
Soaking in carpet water

416
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,711
They're actually leftover shells from rest

417
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,783
So we'll go around and we'll collect

418
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
Shelf

419
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Different

420
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
And on the surface of every shell

421
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
There are little oysters growing

422
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,279
Utilities big brown dots over yeah

423
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
Those are always

424
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
They look like little blobs

425
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
Brown jelly

426
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,703
But if you get really close

427
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
You can see the beginnings of an oyster

428
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,871
You can try to tell on this one this one has like stripes on it that's how you know what that's like it's

429
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
Don't shout slowly growing

430
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,223
I want to gets bigger obviously it'll look like one of you show

431
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
But

432
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Getting there

433
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Chloe

434
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,463
The billion oyster project is an official partner on the living breaker

435
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:21,119
Meaning that millions of little brown balls of Goo grown by Young New Yorkers like Asia

436
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,167
Will soon be protecting

437
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Staten Island

438
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:30,847
The governor's office of storm recovery is scheduled to begin construction of the living breakwaters in 2018

439
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,663
The billion oyster project will work with local high school

440
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,991
Schools on Staten Island to monitor oyster growth over time

441
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:42,111
Add healthy Reef can grow very quickly so and we're very optimistic that by say

442
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,671
2025 we would have a pretty

443
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
Robust

444
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231
Teresa stump going

445
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,655
Kate orff says that even if they're successful they aren't going to return the coastal environment

446
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
The way it was before

447
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
No

448
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Can do that

449
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,543
The creating something totally new

450
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,335
Part ecosystem

451
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
Part info

452
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,455
North hopes that they Inspire other living infrastructure

453
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
Projects

454
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,807
But she doesn't think that oysters are going to save New York

455
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Climate change

456
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
There isn't any one solution

457
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,159
To a problem so immense

458
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
Funplex

459
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:24,352
Researchers at the organization climate Central recently ranked New York as the most vulnerable city in the United States

460
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
What's the sea level rise

461
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:31,776
With / 426 thousand people living in zones that could face serious flooding by 2050

462
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,104
When you start projecting out further than 2050

463
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,176
Scale of a problem becomes hard to fathom

464
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,248
I mean it's really hard to frankly to be optimistic

465
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:47,648
We're on track for pretty rapid sea-level rise and you know can we kind of come together

466
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Gather and

467
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,256
Proactively see this is an Urban Design opportunity

468
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
And not

469
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,072
A force that just died

470
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,632
Displaces thousands of people with

471
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:02,752
Economic means and who are less fortunate I don't know I think it's going to be a real challenge

472
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,848
Orsi's the living breakwaters project

473
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:11,200
As a step toward a healthy relationship between the city and the sea

474
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,296
But to protect New York and other coastal cities in the long-term

475
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,392
There are going to be a lot of other interventions that will need to be considered

476
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
Any new development on Coast

477
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,744
Lifting existing buildings up

478
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
And eventually in some places

479
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
Retreating literally from

480
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,168
I'm flood-prone areas and an

481
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
Can we have those hard conversations

482
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
I certainly hope so

483
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
I hope so too

484
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,384
Because New York is a city by the ocean

485
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
And the water

486
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
Is only getting higher

487
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,720
Oysters aren't the only non-human architects

488
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,560
And that gives us a tour through the extraordinary Builders of the animal kingdom

489
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
After this

490
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Between the beats

491
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,752
Bongs and chatter of our devices

492
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:10,336
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

493
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:15,968
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

494
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:21,856
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and another hearing.

495
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,648
Technology talk to us

496
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,696
It is a creation of Sonic trap

497
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,768
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

498
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,352
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

499
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,400
To make them more human

500
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Turn the living room lights on

501
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Okay

502
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,080
Dim the living room lights to 50

503
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
80%

504
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
Okay

505
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:51,040
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

506
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,088
Makes for a much more natural

507
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
Experience

508
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,904
Turn the living room lights on

509
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,000
Dim the living room lights to 50%

510
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:07,424
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

511
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
About how are sounds gay

512
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,240
Is impacting our health

513
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,800
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

514
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,872
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

515
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,920
Right here on the 99 pi

516
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,272
We need to talk about something

517
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,600
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

518
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,440
It's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine

519
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:35,840
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again

520
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
Again and again

521
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,448
You don't know why and it may be time to seek help

522
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,520
Go to oh my God. Info podcast

523
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:48,640
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

524
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
Oh my God

525
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Flask podcast

526
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,504
Because I'm in the studio with Emma

527
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
Fitzgerald

528
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
PSN in the Beast

529
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,112
You talk with Paul Greenberg and he

530
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
Talk about oysters

531
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,464
Behaving like Architects as they build these massive structures

532
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Shoreline

533
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Migos thinking about other types

534
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,840
So architecture that is not made

535
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
Spyhuman

536
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,144
I mean I think I feel like

537
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
Architecture

538
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,240
And then the other building and structures and buildings is sometimes

539
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,520
Thought about is something that

540
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
Separate

541
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,336
Humans from the beasts

542
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,920
A lot of my favorite artists

543
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Pixar

544
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,504
Weight on stomach

545
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
Is a lot of different

546
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
Samples of Animal Ark

547
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,112
But let's

548
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:35,488
Trial try to do a couple from from different Animal Kingdom so to start with the mammals

549
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
We've got to go with

550
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,792
With beavers

551
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:42,144
What are some of the most obvious example but they really are

552
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,424
Pretty special architect

553
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,728
First of all they build PC

554
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Incredible houses

555
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,312
The Lodges out of sticks and mud and they've got you

556
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
ESchool underwater entrances

557
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,480
Mi amor amazingly they completely re-engineered

558
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,808
The landscape by cutting down trees with their teeth

559
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,112
Damn

560
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
Is that

561
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,440
Essentially will turn you know what's a river

562
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,512
System into a peaceful Pond for them to live in

563
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:14,144
And and I was sort of looking into this and I found this one scientist

564
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,776
Think that they've discovered the largest beaver dam in the world in Northern Alberta

565
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,336
Canada and its its

566
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,664
2790

567
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
Which

568
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,552
Is a larger than thin

569
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,368
Yeah human dance with large gray Hoover Dam

570
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,744
Set this was built in / many / like multiple generation

571
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,328
Sounds of beavers Vino different families contributing to the

572
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,096
Misfits mask

573
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,448
Sedan to create sort of a little Beaver Paradise up there in in Alberta

574
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
Why would think

575
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
Generations

576
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,776
Remarkable

577
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
Switch

578
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:59,456
All right so moving on to Insects their tongues of great examples of Android architect

579
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
But I'm going to go with

580
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Termites

581
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
S1 termites bill

582
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,928
Giant Mounds out of mud

583
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,232
All over the world really in a lot of dry climates

584
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,304
Africa in Australia and South America

585
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:20,960
And and you can get your shoes they can be upwards of like 30 ft tall and mmm really why

586
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
He's really really really large structures

587
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,592
And if you think about that relative

588
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
The size of a

589
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,152
A termites body it's like

590
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,456
Even more impressive

591
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,736
Tall structure

592
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,552
Interino for a termite that's

593
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,344
If you serve scale that up

594
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,368
2R size

595
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,720
It would be something like close to a mile high so they really are

596
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Building

597
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Incredible

598
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,560
Dylan Sprayberry

599
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,352
My favorite thing about

600
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
Termite Mounds really does

601
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
They exist

602
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,960
Really to provide ventilation

603
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
2

604
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:58,336
The termite colonies The Colony exists even under ground and spreads out beneath

605
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,640
You know over a greater distance than it's just

606
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
The termite Mound

607
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,224
But if you get really really hot underground

608
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,576
Especially in these dry climates and so they'll build this structure upwards and

609
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
It's super porous

610
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Senso

611
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,648
Cool breezes

612
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,672
Catch

613
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
And it's

614
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,024
Built in such a way that it ventilate

615
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
The entire colony

616
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,632
Keeps them and it helps them regulate their temperature

617
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,960
Which is just a pretty amazing

618
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:31,616
Is level of innovation for a tiny insect

619
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,432
They been digging and just live in

620
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,736
It really is a purpose-built solution to solve

621
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,880
Yeah and their end anytime

622
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,672
Of different animals and obviously it's like

623
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:52,096
It's not it's not like a single person who has an idea like solution to a problem is like

624
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:58,496
Evolutionary solution of an adaptation that they developed over a long period of time

625
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,544
Walkable to me I don't know either

626
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
That's amazing

627
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:08,992
Alright so this is our last one is is my my personal favorite really does feel like the Artistry of it but

628
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:13,856
There's this bird in that lives in the forest of New Guinea called the vocal cup

629
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:18,464
Bowerbird a bottle cop is my my personal favorite

630
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,560
And it's totally unassuming looking birds like a little brown

631
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,608
Looks kind of like a sparrow

632
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,912
So this is unassuming bird but

633
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,960
The male bowerbird in order to get

634
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,240
Attention

635
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,520
They will spend

636
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,800
Several years

637
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,848
Building these elaborate

638
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
Structures called Bowers

639
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,456
And there really aren't there like they're so beautiful. Like these

640
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,528
They're like these beautiful fat

641
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
Tents

642
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
That they

643
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,624
If they construct using little twigs and sticks

644
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,440
But they're so carefully done if you came across one

645
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:53,536
In the forest you would like you wouldn't even consider that a bird made that it looks like

646
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,816
It was designed by like

647
00:29:55,072 --> 00:30:00,192
Little Ferry architect or something and and yeah the end and then off in the

648
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
Carpeted with a Mossy carpet

649
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,264
Front

650
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,032
Locked up with

651
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
Chew stick

652
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
Set the entrance

653
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,896
And and then decorate

654
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,200
It in these crazy ways will go in and get

655
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
Flowers

656
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,784
Build little piles of flowers

657
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Fairies

658
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
I'm all kinds of especially things that

659
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
Colorful to add color to the Bower

660
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,184
And then it's

661
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,744
All of this is all of this year's of

662
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,792
Of me of building work is all just

663
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,376
This one moment when they're attempting to catch the eye of

664
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,912
Female bowerbird

665
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
2 hour look

666
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:37,056
Athena will come in there might be like more than one of these Bowers in it and I

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

712
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:44,544
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

713
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,872
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

A dad

715
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:53,248
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

716
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,552
Actually if I'm being honest

717
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,600
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

718
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,624
Nothing

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,024

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

722
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:16,288
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

723
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,312
Now

724
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,360
