Here is Joe Richmond

22
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:42,144
It was strangely cold and foggy

23
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,192
On the morning of July 28th

24
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,728
1845

25
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,288
The World War II is coming to a close

26
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,104
In the mood in New York City on that Saturday with cheerful

27
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,432
Millions were eating breakfast running errands

28
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,064
And 120 year old woman was on her way to the 80th floor of the tallest building in the world

29
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
Her name is Betty Lou Oliver

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,232
Did she spend her days going up and down up and down the Empire State Building

31
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,048
As the operator of elevator number 6

32
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,704
What Betty work that morning in her crisp uniform smiling at passengers

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,544
She couldn't have known that outside the building a young US Army pilot

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,592
On his way to LaGuardia Airport

35
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
Was lost in the thick fog

36
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,944
Flying low over Manhattan

37
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:32,320
You couldn't have known that the pilot of that B-25 had just narrowly missed hitting the Chrysler Building

38
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
10 Grand Central

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,696
She might have heard the Roar of the plane as it got closer

40
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,744
She might have wondered what it was

41
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
Has she got called up to the 80th floor

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
Just before 10 a.m.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
At the exact moment

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,472
Plane slammed into the 79th floor of the Empire State Building

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,800
Very experienced every elevator Riders worst

46
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
Nightmare

47
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
Down she fell

48
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
Floor by floor

49
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,200
More than a thousand feet to the sub-basement

50
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,992
What happened next

51
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,808
Put Betty Lou Oliver in the Guinness Book of World Record

52
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
Somehow

53
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
Air pressure built up as the elevator dropped

54
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,440
Slow in the fall

55
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,280
At the same time thousands of feet of loose elevator cable

56
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
Recoiling up on the bottom of the shaft

57
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,144
In the elevator car reach the bottom

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
Those cables acted like a giant spring

59
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
The cushion The Landing

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
It was not a gentle impact

61
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
But he broke her back

62
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Bowflex

63
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
But she was alive

64
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,224
There was a great roaring inside my head

65
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
She said

66
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
And black

67
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,624
Every chapter of history is made of lots of little stories

68
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,720
That was especially true on July 28 1945

69
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,768
Today airplane crash

70
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
Into the Empire State Building

71
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
This is the view from the 79th floor

72
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
My name is Torres

73
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,704
40 Wheeling

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
In 1945 I was 20 years old

75
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,080
And I work for Catholic relief serve

76
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
On the 79th floor

77
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
Of the Empire State Building

78
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
My name is Gloria Paul

79
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
In 1945

80
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
I was working for the Uso headquarters

81
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,184
I was on the 56th floor of the Empire State Building

82
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
It was just

83
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,512
Exciting every time I got off

84
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
The train

85
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
And went up to that 56

86
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
Explode with excitement

87
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
It was the Empire State Building

88
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
Tallest building in the world at that time Rising a quarter of a mile straight up into the clouds

89
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,127
Tallest structure the Empire State Building

90
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,967
Observation platform visitors look down on the New York skyline

91
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,271
1200 feet below

92
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,599
Everyone on the ground looks so small

93
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,647
The cars of the people

94
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,463
You will really part of the

95
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
The clouds

96
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,303
The Empire State Building

97
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,607
A giant of Steel and Stone

98
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:58,495
Hamacas 20th century progress

99
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,567
I'm off of Weingarten I wrote the book

100
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,151
The sky is falling about the B-25 Bomber

101
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
Crashed into the Empire State

102
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
The pilot of the

103
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,551
The plane was Captain William

104
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
Franklin Smith

105
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
A highly decorated

106
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
Early in the morning

107
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
On July 28th 1940

108
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
5

109
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
Captain Smith

110
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
Massachusetts

111
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Took the New York

112
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Area

113
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,471
That morning was Misty cloudy day

114
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
At the Empire State Building

115
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,103
We could really see the ground from the 79th floor

116
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:40,991
It was so foggy outside I was looking out of the window there's nothing to say it was just like pea soup is like a London Fog

117
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
It was very foggy in the office

118
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,415
This morning Minami B-25 twin-engine Bomber passed over LaGuardia field and ask for a weather report

119
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
Captain Smith

120
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
Called into LaGuardia field

121
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
NSAID

122
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,095
I request clearance to land

123
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:01,215
Power said we have almost zero visibility here

124
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,031
I suggest you do not like

125
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
Here at LaGuardia

126
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:11,967
The product was warned that the weather was bad and at the tower of the Empire State Building a landmark for a man in this area

127
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
Could not be seen

128
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,807
Smith said thank you very much

129
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
And sign.

130
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
He ignored

131
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,695
After / 50 missions in Europe

132
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
Flying in the worst weather conditions imagine

133
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,863
What could possibly happen to him here in the United States

134
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
And so he started to make a little bit of a turn which brought him over Midtown Manhattan

135
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,847
And as he started

136
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
To straighten out

137
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,455
The clouds broke up enough for him to realize

138
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,527
He was flying among skyscrapers

139
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,391
Foggy Saturday morning five blocks north of the Empire State Building

140
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
James Yeager

141
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,487
Dictating into a soundscriber machine

142
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
I let her to Dean Crawford

143
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
University of Michigan

144
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,471
By the sound of a plane rolling down Fifth Avenue

145
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:11,871
And you can hear him

146
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:18,271
Dictating the letter as the sound of the engines get louder and louder

147
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,671
Louder as it passes by his office window

148
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:31,071
Voice stops in a second or so later on the tape you hear a dull thud

149
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,471
Which is the impact of the bomber into the Empire State Building

150
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
At

151
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
About five minutes of 10

152
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
I got up from my desk

153
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,271
And that was the end of the office as it existed

154
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,439
We are delaying the start of our regularly scheduled program to bring you a special news report on the crash of an airplane into the empire

155
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
State Building

156
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,767
Columbia Station

157
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,119
And all of a sudden the building felt like it was going to just talk about over

158
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
It just

159
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,703
Really across the room and I

160
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
Landed against the wall

161
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,591
People were screaming and looking at each other and didn't know what to do

162
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,663
Play the newest is a bomb but what happened

163
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:24,319
A B-25 Mitchell bomber on a flight apparently a routine flight from Boston to Newark

164
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,599
Or New York City

165
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:30,463
Crashed into the 78th are the 79th story of the Empire State Building

166
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,559
At what the final toll will be there is no way of telling at this time

167
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,607
On the other side of the office

168
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
All I could see was flames

169
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
Mystic Mountain

170
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,287
Was walking through the office when the plane hit the building

171
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
Then he was on fire

172
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,663
His clothes were on fire his head was on fire

173
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:55,039
Six of us managed to get into this one office that seem to be on touch

174
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
By the fire

175
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
And close the door

176
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
Before it engulfed us

177
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
It was no doubt that the other people

178
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
Must have been killed

179
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
The 4 alarm fire is gone every piece

180
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,167
The fire apparatus to the busy scene of 5th Avenue and 34th Street

181
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
In the heart of Manhattan

182
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:17,055
And hundreds of office workers with trap 2/5 of a mile above the street level

183
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,871
It was a very small Universe at that point

184
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
DeSoto

185
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Ducks

186
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,735
And then Island was firewall around us

187
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,063
Couple of women had to had passed out from the smoke

188
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
And I

189
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
Had a handkerchief in my pocket

190
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:37,279
And so I use that to cover my nose and mouth to protect me from the fumes

191
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,119
But I didn't expect to get out alive

192
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
Somebody opens window

193
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,239
And I'm sitting there

194
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
And

195
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
I thought about my rings

196
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
I figured somebody else might as well

197
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
Have you thought of them

198
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
So I

199
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
Took them off my fingers

200
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
And

201
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
Throw them out the window

202
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
We have

203
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
Contact that I Witness

204
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:07,743
But the bill Kirby at the Grand advertising agency contact with him by telephone

205
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
The Caribbean

206
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,423
I look out of the window and it was very very smoking terribly

207
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
Go to the window and I saw two girls

208
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:24,127
Crap, 78th floor that's above our floor is he I'm going to 76 that you fly to

209
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
Period stories down

210
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,991
You looked up and he signals up to us

211
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
I think Charlotte was sitting

212
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,367
Is always hot legs dangling inside the office and

213
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,903
We were holding on to her

214
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
I gave her a better view of what was going on

215
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,543
Get back now Baby Got Back

216
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,847
I guess he was trying to give us a little solace

217
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,919
I know that you're there don't worry

218
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
And that was a

219
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,271
That was a connection with the rest of the world in it

220
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,111
We all felt a little better to know that someone new

221
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
We were there

222
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:14,559
When the plane hit the outside of the building it kept on going and the engines

223
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:19,423
Continue about 20 feet into the building and went down through the Elevator Shaft

224
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
What Was An Elevator Shaft

225
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,263
When the plane hit

226
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
Parts of the engine

227
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,103
Fluid head and severed

228
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Lyft

229
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Steam table

230
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,223
Of the elevators that had been at the 79th

231
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Floor

232
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,807
Sitting in one of the elevators

233
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Was

234
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
Is a young

235
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,927
Elevator operator named Betty Lou Oliver

236
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,303
She started to plunge down the Elevator Shaft from the 79th

237
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,375
Floor tables of two of the cars were sheared

238
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,447
Sending both elevators crashing to the sub-basement

239
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
All the Empire State Building

240
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
She was alive

241
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
She broke

242
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Her pelvis

243
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
Back

244
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Nick

245
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
But you survived

246
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:10,111
Reverend John Jay Morrison has just come in and he has just given the last rites

247
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
Nomad Hotel

248
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,975
And landed on a parapet I think it's on the 16

249
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,559
65th and 66th

250
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
I think

251
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,167
My name is Sharon during cizauskas

252
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
My father was

253
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
Paul Deering

254
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
My father was in a corner office

255
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
On the 79th floor

256
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
Either was forced out by the

257
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,479
The crush the concussion or

258
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
Or he actually had to jump

259
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
When I saw

260
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
Whole place on fire

261
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,463
It's more likely that he had to jump

262
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,583
You know if you were up 79 floors and looking down

263
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
To think of someone having two

264
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
Jump out of a window up there

265
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
That's what I think

266
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,919
We're speaking from the Empire State Building

267
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,503
Near the top of the building 79th floor where fireman

268
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,879
Picking up the debris caused by the crash of a Mitchell B-25 Bomber

269
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
End of this building

270
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,975
Write about 40 feet from where we stand

271
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,327
All of a sudden he would do a fireman and that they're coming to rescue us YouTube

272
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,423
All dressed up in their raincoats and whatever they wear in over there

273
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
It was just

274
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Wonderful

275
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
We climbed out screws

276
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
Broken glass

277
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
I was just grateful to be alive

278
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:41,247
The walls are still hot the brick and stone walls that we have our hand on as we talk

279
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,807
Are still hot with the

280
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,879
Claim that has been out for over an hour now

281
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183
112 flights later

282
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,255
We got to the bottom floor

283
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,303
But we do know what happened

284
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
Until we came out of the building

285
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,703
I see crowds of people are kind of looking at each other

286
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
What happened what happened

287
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,847
And he pointed up to the 79th floor

288
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
I saw the

289
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919

290
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:15,039
