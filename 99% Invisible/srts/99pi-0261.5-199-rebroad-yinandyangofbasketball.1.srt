36
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
77 year old man

37
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,424
He made possible the game

38
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
Miguel going to meet him now

39
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,568
That tape is from an old New York radio show called We the People

40
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,616
The guest is James Naismith

41
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
125 years ago in 1891 Naismith was a PE instructor at a small College in Springfield

42
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
Field Massachusetts

43
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,856
When a particularly bad snowstorm straw

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
4 days the students couldn't go Outdoors

45
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,744
Show the began roughhousing in the hall

46
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,560
We tried everything to keep them quiet

47
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
Something had to be done

48
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,912
One day I had an idea

49
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
Call the boys to the gym

50
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,776
Divided them up into teams of 9

51
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,568
And gave him a new soccer ball

52
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,688
I showed them to Peach basket side nailed up at each end of the gym

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
I told them the idea

54
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,320
What's the threw the ball into the opposing team's Peach Pass

55
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,672
Sports don't have such a definitive point of origin

56
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
But this one does

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
I blew a whistle

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,792
The first game of basketball begin

59
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
That day in 1891

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
James Naismith

61
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
Invented basketball

62
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,752
And what rules did you have for your new game

63
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Indoctrination

64
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
Well I didn't have enough

65
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,616
That's where I made my big mistake

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
The boys begins Tech

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,456
Kicking and punching in the country

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
They ended up in a free-for-all in the middle of the gym floor

69
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,904
In subsequent weeks Naismith would go on to make more rules for the game

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,952
Some of those are still around today

71
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,024
Like the one that says players can't run while holding the ball

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
They have to dribble it

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
The temperature rule but a design decision that he made back in 1891

74
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,752
That continues to define the way the game is played

75
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,336
He had to decide how high to hang the peach basket

76
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,992
That's Cari Champion she's an anchor at ESPN and host of the be honest podcast and she's going to help us

77
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
Large toy today

78
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,112
Naismith chose to hang the peach basket at 10 feet above the porch floor

79
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,184
There was a running track that went around the court at that level

80
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,744
But otherwise the decision was pretty random

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,304
And just a little higher or a little lower

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
And everything would be different

83
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
That arbitrary decision

84
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,240
To put the basket at 10 ft

85
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,336
Cause the game of basketball to take shape around the tallest player

86
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
But it happened gradually

87
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,968
In fact in the beginning the game was played by shorter less imposing

88
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
In the very early days of the game

89
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,856
People didn't really have a conception of height having really

90
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
Any importance of

91
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
Mets writer and journalist Andrew Heiser

92
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,744
So a lot of the other high scores in the very early days

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
Guys who like sex

94
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
But all it was not until

95
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
A few decades in

96
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
That

97
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
Team started

98
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,167
Recruiting really tall guys

99
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
Accident at the time they were sort of refer to often as

100
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Goon

101
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,335
Nowadays if you play a little rough or dirty you might be called a goon

102
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,431
Back then big men were sometimes called goons just because they were big

103
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,343
The first so-called going to have a major impact on the game was a big white dude named George Mikan who played for the Mini Apple

104
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
Who is Lakers from 1948

105
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
21956

106
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:49,279
He was a 6-foot 10 monster who wore big round spectacles when he play

107
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,679
Notice the comparative size of referee Ackman

108
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519
Miken towered over his opponents

109
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
Ambrose scoring records with his strength inaccurate

110
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:18,207
Mike and with such a force they actually had to change some rules in the game to offset his advantage

111
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,791
For example the rule against goaltending came about because it might

112
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
Goaltending is the act of catching or

113
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,703
Batting away another player shot as the ball is on a downward path for the basket

114
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:34,335
Mike and was so tall he could just stand under the basket and SWAT away Shots by the other team

115
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,151
Goaltending was banned in 1945

116
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,295
But rule changes didn't stop George Mikan or his fellow big man from dominating defensively and offense

117
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:50,207
You start seeing people saying like it's too easy to score like they actually were really swerve disgusted they thought this should be a Triumph

118
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,535
Have to get the ball in the hoop not something that happens a hundred sometimes

119
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,911
The ease with which these super-tall players could put the ball in the basket was

120
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
Alarming people

121
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,007
The traditionalist didn't like the way the game was going

122
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
But they had no

123
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Idea

124
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
What was about to hit them

125
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
Bad dog

126
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
Sometimes called the slam dunk

127
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,415
The first one in organized game happened in 1936

128
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,511
Donkey didn't really get going in basketball until the 1960s

129
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
Man the traditionalist

130
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
They hated the dunk

131
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,191
But not just because it was a new unconventional way to put the ball in the basket

132
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
The dump became political

133
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
The chi year

134
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,103
Is 1966

135
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:45,503
My name is Matt Andrews I teach American history of UNC Chapel Hill and I have a particular Focus

136
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,807
Tucson Sport and Society

137
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
So it was in 1960s

138
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
In the NCAA champions

139
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
Game Texas Western

140
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
With an all-black starting five

141
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,279
Easily defeat 8 off for UPS all white

142
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
University of

143
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Kentucky team

144
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:05,471
This win by Texas Western against Kentucky was a big deal in the college basketball world

145
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,055
Kentucky was one of the last major college teams in the country

146
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,359
It still didn't have any black players

147
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,175
The coach of Kentucky with a guy named Adolph Rupp

148
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,479
Mini View dim as a racer

149
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,343
According to the sports correspondent Frank Deford who is in the Kentucky locker room that night

150
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,927
The language rap use against the Texas Western players

151
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
Send a chill

152
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
Down his spine

153
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
And there was this moment

154
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
Right at the beginning of the game

155
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,655
We're Texas Western David Lattin gets the ball and makes a move toward the hoop

156
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,215
The defender in front of him is Pat Riley

157
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,567
He go on to win nine NBA titles as a player coach and executive

158
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
And Latin flies over him

159
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
While he's like 6 foot 4 stockley belt

160
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,527
And Latin just rises above him and slams The Ball

161
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:00,255
Texas's Victory and Latins dunk were seen as direct challenges

162
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
Stuby establishment

163
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,351
After all this was 1966

164
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
There was a lot going on in America

165
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,703
Black Panthers have become invisible force

166
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,775
In Oakland the Panthers had armed and organized themselves

167
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
Protect their communities from brutal racist police

168
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,895
How many white Americans were worried

169
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
A Revolution was about to take place

170
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
Black Power

171
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
Was this new evocative free

172
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:30,207
So that the failure to pass the Civil Rights bill isn't because of black power isn't because of the student

173
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,535
What's so interesting about this phrase is it

174
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,887
Lack of specificity no one is exactly sure what black power mean

175
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,703
Into this context comes the duck

176
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,799
Everything seems to be black power manifest on the basketball

177
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
The dunk

178
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,359
Is

179
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,175
Physical the dunk is

180
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,575
Forceful you know when you lay the ball in your laying the ball in but when you dunk you're doing it to

181
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,159
Someone and at a time when so many white Americans

182
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
AR

183
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,999
Uneasy with the Specter of black

184
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Violence

185
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
The dunk

186
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Becomes

187
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Suspect

188
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:14,239
Then to scare people like a tall frap even more comes a player called Lew Alcindor

189
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
He would later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and become one of the most exciting and famous players in the history of the game

190
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
But in 1967 he was a young man

191
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
7 ft

192
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
2 inches tall

193
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:30,623
And already tearing up the college game with his vicious dunks in fast movement

194
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,695
Alcindor surrounded by white shirt

195
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
Unstoppable

196
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,887
So the NCAA Betsy National Collegiate Athletic Association made a decision

197
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,471
The only way to stop this guy with to get rid of the thing he did best

198
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
The slam dunk

199
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
In 1967

200
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
They banned the dunk

201
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
And for 10 years

202
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
There's no dunking in college basketball

203
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,015
Lew Alcindor AKA Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

204
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
Was not happy about this

205
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
In fact he explicitly said that the only reason for the band was because they were scared that black guys like him we're going to take over

206
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,511
For the game although he was much stronger word

207
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
Regardless

208
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
The slam dunk was done

209
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,631
In college basketball with sent back in time

210
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
For 10 years

211
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,471
Basketball was in a bad place

212
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
The NCAA administrators had made in

213
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,359
Arguably racist decision to ban the slam dunk

214
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
Meanwhile in the professional League the NBA

215
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,247
Players can still dunk but fans were losing interest

216
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
Here's Andrew heysel again

217
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
This is

218
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
For the NBA

219
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
Considered like

220
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
The low point of the

221
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,815
The NCAA administrators had made an arguably racist decision to ban the slam dunk

222
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,375
Meanwhile in the professional League the NBA

223
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,447
Players can still dunk but fans were losing interest

224
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
Here's Andrew heysel again

225
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
This is

226
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
For the NBA

227
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
Considered like the

228
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Low point

229
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Of the week

230
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,687
They're all of these pieces written about how

231
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,759
The game is dying and nobody wants to watch and there's all these

232
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
Questions about why

233
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,647
Naismith original accidental design decision to put the basket at 10 ft

234
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,999
I didn't Brittany given us this beautiful and exciting slam dunk

235
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:17,631
But it also caused the professional game to revolve too much around these super tall player

236
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
The game you got jammed up around the net

237
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
People weren't passing as much

238
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,359
They just hand the ball to the giant guy and he'd stand under the basket

239
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
Trying to put it in

240
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,199
This had the effect of slowing down the play

241
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,503
And that slowness was draining the game of its

242
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
Excitement basketball needed a design solution

243
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,135
People suggested a lot of fixes

244
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
No backbone

245
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
Contacts backup

246
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
A smaller basket a bigger ball

247
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
A smaller ball

248
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
I know scoring Zone around the basket

249
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
And even a hike app

250
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,935
Another group of coaches called for the hoop to be raised to 12 ft

251
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
None of those changes caught on

252
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
And then

253
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
This guy comes along

254
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,383
We feel that those people who are not

255
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
Under contractual obligation to

256
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Would you like to take a look

257
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,319
To remember George Mike the original NBA goon 6 foot 10 inches tall with

258
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
Big round specs

259
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:14,463
Will in 1967 he was working as a travel agent in Minnesota where he used to play

260
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,863
When you get to call from a couple of guys asking if you want to head up a new professional basketball league that would compete with the end

261
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:25,215
NBA NBA friends have to say about his new job

262
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Good luck

263
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,407
I mean it really was just sort of making up that you go on

264
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
It was

265
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
Simply let's get an idea

266
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
And let's see what we can do here

267
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,623
That's Terry Pluto who wrote a book about the founding of this new league

268
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
They called it the ABS

269
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
The American Basketball Association

270
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,279
And George Mikan became its first commissioner

271
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,863
They were trying everything to get fans re-engaged in a game

272
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,191
Sometimes they featured Cow Milking contest for entertainment

273
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,495
And 1/2 time show in Indiana

274
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,799
About the wrestling bear called Victor

275
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,615
Beautiful Brown

276
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
Bear looks to be

277
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
That he weighs at least five

278
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,783
Most of their ideas didn't stack

279
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,623
A lot of times good ideas are like that they're one of 12 things at

280
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,975
People stuck to the wall in and out of the 12-1 became really good

281
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,791
One helped a little bit in the other tenor almost embarrassing

282
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,607
In this case one of the ideas was really good

283
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,447
In fact it's the design solution that arguably saved basketball

284
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,775
In the secret star of the story that were telling right now

285
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
The three-point

286
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Shot

287
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,879
So all you sports fans know this

288
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,183
Smithfield we're all worth 2 point

289
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
But the aviators innovation

290
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
Which they actually borrowed from an earlier defense wig

291
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,839
What's the draw an arch line

292
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,143
About 22 feet away from basket

293
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,447
In any shot made from behind that a lot

294
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Was now worth

295
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Replay

296
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,055
The ABA was trying to please the fan

297
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,871
Fans get excited when they see a 3-pointer

298
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,175
But they can also go and practice the shot at home

299
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,831
It's more egalitarian Ramona Shelburne senior writer for espn.com

300
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,623
If I practice hard enough

301
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
Don't have to be the most athletic guy in the core

302
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
I don't have to be

303
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,303
An incredible dunker it's it's something that when fans watch it they think I can do that too

304
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:32,959
In 1976 the NBA merged with the ABA and three years later they brought in the three-point shot

305
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
At first it was about pleasing the fans

306
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,847
But they slowly came to realize something about the three-point shot

307
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
When you study if you shoot

308
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
35% on 3-pointers

309
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
And you shoot

310
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,759
45% on 2.0

311
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
Just break it down

312
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,599
It makes so much more sense to

313
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,647
Build a team around 3-point shooting because

314
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,719
You're going to score more points in the point of the game

315
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,791
And now some teams have decided that the way to win

316
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
Is the concentrate

317
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Country boy shot

318
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
When NBA first introduce the 3-point shot

319
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
Games featured

320
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
Only a couple of 3 point attempts

321
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
This season

322
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,079
It's more than ten times that

323
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,175
And if there's any team that's demonstrating the value of the 3 point shot right now

324
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,991
Is the Golden State Warriors from California

325
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
And Mister Steph Curry

326
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Hurry

327
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,543
If you don't know who Steph Curry as he's about six foot three so he's short by NBA standards but this hasn't stopped him from being the

328
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,871
Star of the team end of the whole NBA

329
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,199
I think every kid growing up in American I was trying to be Seth Curry

330
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
He is

331
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,247
Skinny and

332
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,343
Doesn't seem to have anything physically dominant about him

333
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
And yet when you watch him play He's Alive

334
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,463
Curry can hit 3-pointers for Golden State

335
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,999
From really anywhere Eli

336
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:04,607
Text which makes it hard to defend against them and balances the influence of the big men

337
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,423
Because of their guys like her who can score from

338
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Anywhere

339
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,263
In the 7-foot guys have to move away from the basket

340
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
Weather most useful

341
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
Could have been

342
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,895
And once you allow players to score an extra point

343
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,943
From shooting further out the game

344
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Spreads out

345
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
You got a whole new game

346
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,063
The game has changed for the better

347
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
Is no doubt about it

348
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,415
That's former Indiana Pacer Jerry Harkness

349
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,975
Harkness was a player in the NBA and the ABA

350
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
Because the game is exciting

351
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
The game is running shoe

352
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Quickness

353
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Defense

354
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
Opening the game up

355
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
Making it more aggressive

356
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,287
But even though the three point shot has had a balancing influence

357
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
Some traditionalists

358
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,847
Still don't like it

359
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,919
Eagles basketball

360
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,015
You're like a circus sort of thing when we were five points.

361
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
7 point shot

362
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,951
You know what is it stop doing that sort of thing. Just old school that San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich

363
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,303
Speaking to ESPN about Steph Curry's Golden State Warriors last year

364
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,655
What Popovich is saying kind of Echoes what people said about the dump 50 years ago

365
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
That it's a trick

366
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,983
A departure from the fundamentals of basketball

367
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
And I kind of agree with Coach pop

368
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,359
But even Popovich seems to think that the 3-point shot is here to stay

369
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:25,503
Do certain degree you better Embrace are you going to lose and every time we want to Championship 3-point shot was a big part of it

370
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,623
Instead of Designing the beautiful powerful dunk out of the game we designed a counterbalance

371
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
The 3 point shot

372
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,719
And now the game is more inclusive than it's ever been

373
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,815
You got these little guys I can shoot bombs from anywhere on the court

374
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,119
And there's still room for the big guys close in

375
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
The three-pointer and the dunk

376
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
And become the yin and yang

377
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
A basketball

378
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,031
All of this has sort of been by axe

379
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,847
The 10-foot tall basket to dunk

380
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
The 3 point shot

381
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
But then again the game wasn't

382
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,223
Carefully designed in the first place

383
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,551
Really it came about because all James Naismith wanted

384
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
What's to stop some rowdy kids

385
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,647
I'm getting into too much trouble

386
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
And the whole thing

387
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,023
Started with a couple of peach baskets I put up in The Little Gym

388
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
48 years ago

389
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,119
I guess it just goes to show

390
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,911
What you can do if you have

391
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967

396

Nope

397
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
Did it happen in one day

398
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,327
Nope

399
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
Never know what kind of

400
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,311
Yep

401
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:01,247
The Houston Rockets actually broke the Golden State Warriors record for most threes in a season this year

402
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
But the Warriors

403
