Roman Mars

26
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,264
If you could recognize any piece of classical music

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
I bet it's this one

28
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,664
This is true release written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1810

29
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,760
Maybe it reminds you of piano lessons you took when you were a kid

30
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,088
In my town it was also the song the ice cream truck used

31
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
To play

32
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,184
That's producer Avery trufelman

33
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,232
But if you live in Taiwan

34
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,304
And you hear a truck rumbling down the street playing Fearless

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,608
It doesn't mean it's time to buy a pops

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,448
It means it's time to take out your trash

37
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,544
Because this is what a garbage truck in Taiwan sounds

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,784
This garbage truck song isn't just supposed to be cute and fun

39
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,600
Although it is also supposed to be cute and fun

40
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
The singing garbage truck

41
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,208
Are all a part of a completely different way of

42
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,608
Thinking about waste disposal completely different that is from the way that we think about it in the United States

43
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,216
In the late 1990s Taiwan recycled only 5% of its waste

44
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,776
Today Taiwan recycles well over half

45
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,848
The country is now among the world's top recyclers

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,712
And what changed in this. Has a lot to do with the way that the trash is collected

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,576
Okay serious isn't the only song the trucks play

48
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,624
In Taipei the capital of Taiwan

49
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
The trucks also play

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
This song

51
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:45,632
That's a maiden's Prayer by Polish composer tekla about a Zeus cupbearer mosca

52
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,240
In Taipei City the garbage trucks just alternate between these two songs

53
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
Protectors to pledge

54
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Tucson

55
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
Stu music didn't

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
Taipei City

57
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,968
Given the elementary school kids can sing the song

58
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Cell

59
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
We have brainwashed

60
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
This is Dr Jasmine Wang

61
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
And she grew up in Taipei

62
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,696
Since I was a child I knew that every time when it got it

63
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Dutrac

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Cubs

65
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
We will hear that

66
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:18,400
Now the singing garbage trucks are such a part of life it's hard to imagine a time before them

67
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,216
But that's fine actually wasn't too long ago

68
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
We used to have a lot of Peppa Pig

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,664
Dumpster so they have a lot of rats mosquitoes and things like that and it's not

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
Packing for our house

71
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,832
Just a couple of decades ago of Taipei residents through their trash into massive smelly dumpsters on the streets

72
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,392
Garbage would end up in piles on the sidewalk

73
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
Canton parks

74
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
Food faster in the heat

75
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
It was just nasty

76
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,632
Then taiwan's democratization accelerated in the mid-1980s and created this desire to tidy up

77
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,704
Being a modern country means being a clean country

78
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,800
And when you have foreign visitors coming and visiting your Capital they shouldn't think

79
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
Oh this place is dirty

80
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,872
This is Mary Alice Haddad

81
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
Charity East Asian studies at Wesleyan University

82
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,992
In Taiwan the

83
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
Pro-democracy

84
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Movement

85
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Got

86
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,880
Pulling entangled with the environmental movement

87
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
And so as all those things move together

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
And I'd late 80s early 90s

89
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
Then the

90
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:21,119
Pro-democracy and pro-environment agenda Scott on to the public

91
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
Consciousness

92
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:29,055
Also the environmental movement had a practical and Taiwan was running out of space to actually put piles

93
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
The trash

94
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,407
Because it's a small island extremely populous

95
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
Small island

96
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
There's not that much

97
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
Base word us you're going to stick all your junk

98
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,367
Where is in the United States there has been historically a sense of the

99
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,671
Untamed untappd

100
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,719
Endless wilderness

101
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
And you could just

102
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:53,375
Throw your junk Into the Wilderness and it would go away and you wouldn't have to worry about any more not true in Taipei

103
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Suffolk city bus

104
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,447
But it's really clean and the Subways are clean in that

105
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
Sores are clean in the sidewalks

106
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
To clean and it's really Pleasant to be there

107
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:05,151
You never know that the city used to have piles of garbage littering the streets

108
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
Type A and A number of other Taiwanese cities

109
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:12,063
Reduce the amount of trash by changing the way the trash get collected

110
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Take a look at my garbage

111
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
This is my friend Aaron Newport

112
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
She lives in Taipei

113
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
Where the garbage truck comes

114
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
Five nights a week

115
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
EBay

116
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
Like after work

117
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,119
Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday and Saturday

118
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,471
In Aaron's neighborhood trucks come twice in the evening at 5 and at 7

119
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
I usually once I mean

120
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,639
It's kind of hard sometimes to find the time to always

121
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
Be home at 5

122
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
5 / 7

123
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
Erin has to gather her own garbage and

124
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,063
Cycling and bring it out to a designated street corner and wait

125
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
For the big yellow truck to come

126
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
Frontier perks for the sound

127
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
MP release or maiden's prayer

128
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
Coming down the block

129
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
Basically this is a business system where a garbage can was system your trash goes right from your house to the truck

130
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
Ideally without ever touching the straight

131
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,751
You just have to bring out your garbage in a special bag

132
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
I pay my garb

133
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Bye

134
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,455
These official blue garbage bags

135
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,247
Say city of Taipei on them

136
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
And each is emblazoned with us

137
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
I buy them from the

138
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
Convenience store crossword

139
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:25,535
The official blue garbage bags come in a number of different sizes ranging from 3L to 120

140
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,607
The more garbage you throw away the more it'll cost you

141
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,935
And although Taipei residents have to pay for their garbage by the bag

142
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
Recycling and compost

143
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Are free

144
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,543
You don't need to buy bags for them at all

145
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,871
You can just take out your recycling in not official plastic bags

146
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,711
And you can generate as much compost and recycling as you'd like

147
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,807
So residents are incentivized to recycle more and throw Outlet

148
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,135
What's Aaron sort out all of her recyclables into

149
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
Perfect categories

150
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
These are the cans

151
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,791
Cans and bottle so we have a few tea bottles

152
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,655
So in Taipei every yellow garbage truck is followed by a small white recycling truck

153
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,215
Is basically a cart full of different bands

154
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
There's a bin for plastic bottles

155
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
14 glass bottle

156
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,079
Different Metals in cans

157
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
Papers and cardboard

158
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
In a compost bucket for raw food weight

159
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
Compost bucket

160
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
Overcooked Foodway

161
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,343
Taipei residents have to sort their recycling into all these different categories themselves

162
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,743
Although in the recycling trucks there are officials and volunteers who can help instruct you about which item

163
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Goes where

164
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,839
So Aaron her housemates and I got all of her bags

165
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Trash and differ

166
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,143
Kinds of recycling sorted out

167
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
And we walked about a block down the street

168
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
To wait with the rest of her neighbors

169
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,799
Who are all clutching official blue garbage bag

170
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
A lot of people gathered

171
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
Genesis Maybe

172
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
Larger than your average

173
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
Bridge Trail

174
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
Then

175
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
The moment we were waiting for

176
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:56,927
Yeah there was this Mad Dash of people swarming to the

177
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
School bus yellow garbage

178
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
And the white recycling truck

179
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,327
Okay let's not coughing at end

180
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:08,191
Swiftly tossing their separate recyclables in the bins tossing their blue bags and the garbage truck

181
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,471
And running away

182
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,751
It was Madness

183
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Like

184
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,311
Extremely well organized Madness

185
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
I was so chaotic

186
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,175
And this system for all its chaos has been working

187
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,039
Taipei City used to produce 3296 tons of trash a day

188
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,879
Today the city produces about 1000 tonnes a day

189
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
That is according to Jen with you

190
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
When is 65 official

191
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,023
Who supervised the garbage trucks and their routes

192
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
I met him at a garbage pickup site

193
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
Where Jasmine Wong acted as interpreter

194
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Everett

00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
Mr10

196
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
And he is

197
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
Supervisor

198
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,919
District 10 overseas 20 garbage truck routes

199
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,759
And all those trucks have to make sure that citizens are sorting properly

200
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,343
If it's a Friday garbage tree in the recycling

201
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Back

202
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
WWE Raw

203
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
Cheap tell them that you cannot do that

204
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,023
One more time otherwise see you again

205
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
And how much

206
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,375
Is the ticket 200 US dollars

207
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,679
Podesta maximum

208
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
You might think

209
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
This is such a drag

210
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,359
There must be some people who Buck the system by tossing their trash into public trash cans

211
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
Well

212
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,199
There are hardly any public trash cans in Taipei

213
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,015
They're only in train stations or at bus stops

214
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,831
And those are little they come up just below your knees

215
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
So in Taipei for the most part

216
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,927
If you eat a candy or buy a coffee

217
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
You just take your empty coffee

218
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
Or your candy wrapper

219
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
Put it in your pocket and bring it home

220
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Your trash

221
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
You put in your blue bag

222
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
And bring out to the truck

223
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Yourself

224
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,775
It's hard to imagine a system like this working here in the US

225
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:52,127
Every city here has a different method of trash pickup but across-the-board

226
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:57,247
Uniting factor is that our American trash pickup system strive to be invisible

227
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,879
The trucks made great efforts to come when we're working or sleeping or trying to sleep

228
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,975
Keeping out of the way of traffic and not disturbing the flow of the city

229
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,095
We take our trash and recycling out to Benz or down a shoe door to a dumpster

230
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
And

231
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
It's gone

232
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
We don't have to think about it

233
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
According to the EPA

234
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
Americans recycle and compost

235
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
About 34% of their

236
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
Which is less than most rich country

237
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,687
But some American cities do a lot better

238
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:33,087
San Francisco has probably the most forward recycling program in North America this is Robert Reed

239
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
Is the representative of Recology

240
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,951
The company that takes care of San Francisco's waste

241
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
Recycling and compost

242
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,887
Unlike type A which has a public trash pickup system mini waste pickup services in the US are private

243
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
And we are the customers

244
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,983
That's how it works with ecology which means

245
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
They got to keep their customers happy

246
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
Number one Focus

247
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Provides

248
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,127
Superior customer service

249
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
Their next focus is to

250
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
Do as much recycling as possible

251
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,807
And to make recycling easy and convenient for customers

252
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
Recology has set up

253
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,903
Similar incentives to the system in Taipei

254
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,743
What trash pickup is way more expensive than recycling or compost

255
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
For example in San Francisco

256
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,887
Recycling and compost cost about $2 a month per bin

257
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
Trash is about $26 a month

258
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
Above all

259
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
Recology system is mint

260
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
To be simple and

261
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Stress

262
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
It has to be

263
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,663
If you want people to keep paying for your service

264
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,503
People have a lot of demands in their lives we understand that

265
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,087
Young recycling might not be the very first thing they got the guy

266
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
Make a boss happy to go to pay their mortgage

267
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,719
Garbage and recycling and composting might not always be at the top of the list

268
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:49,119
We understand that basically instead of putting the onus on the citizens to separate the different kind of compost and

269
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
Recycling for themselves

270
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
Recology does the brunt of the work

271
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Sorting

272
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,495
So we don't have to

273
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,847
San Francisco like a lot of other American cities that collect recycling

274
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,407
Uses one catch-all recycling bin

275
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,991
So you throw your cans or bottles are cardboard all in the same place

276
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
And then all those different materials end up and if it

277
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
Facility

278
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
Like recycle Centre

279
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,951
So this is recycle Central this is the

280
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Large

281
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,535
Recycling plant on pier 96

282
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,399
Where we sort all the materials from the blue band The Bottles cans with paper

283
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
We're going to go inside now

284
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
The facility is massive

285
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,871
That's where ecology process is most of San Francisco's recycling

286
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Straight bag

287
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
Pile of recycling

288
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
This is

289
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
From this morning

290
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
This is from one day

291
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
And we're going to get this sorted out

292
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
Because we got another big

293
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,463
File coming in tomorrow so we do 600

294
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Tons a day here

295
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:53,375
That 600 ton pile will wind its way of a huge surreal web of conveyor belt

296
00:12:53,887 --> 00:13:00,031
Where some of the 173 people on staff will separate the recyclables into 16 categories of

297
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Materials

298
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,359
With the help of some Modern Recycling equipment

299
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,991
So we've got a magnet's and we have fish ladders that separate bottles

300
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
Zoo cams from paper

301
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,183
They're on a they're on an angle and they temporarily suspend gravity and to make sure everything gets precisely sordid

302
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,583
There's some real state-of-the-art technology like this apparatus that separates clear plastic from color plastic with

303
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Optic sensor

304
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
Right here

305
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:33,311
The scanners looking at the materials as they come by and when it sees a clear plastic like a clear plastic water

306
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
Ball and hits it with a puff of air

307
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
Can you can hear it

308
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:43,807
Expensive across $3000000 for this machine

309
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
Going to keep for the Netherlands

310
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
So this system

311
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:54,047
With all that worrying twirling conveyors and magnets and machinery and 173 employees

312
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Dazzling

313
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
Make less trash by doing more cycling

314
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
And recycling

315
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,775
Creates ten times more jobs than landfilling or incineration

316
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,895
Of course it also takes all the direct sorting out of the hands of people who actually create the waist

317
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,687
Charges them for the services

318
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
Instead

319
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
As a result

320
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Recycling in the US

321
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Canby

322
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:20,927
I guess that's part of the problem like to the extent that there's pushback in recycling which I've seen some of it in the United

323
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,743
It states now is often about the cost of it and now it's

324
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Guitar cost

325
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,863
And that's true if you're using me single-stream processes function

326
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
And it's less true

327
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
The household

328
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,751
That's Professor Mary Alice her. Again

329
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:39,871
Your community wants to recycle all that stuff needs to be separated and sorted

330
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Somehow

331
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,479
What do you use a $3000000 machine from the Netherlands

332
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,367
For compelling entire sweet potato shaped island of people to stand on the corner at night

333
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
The Taipei system is

334
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,255
Cheap and efficient because the city has conscripted their citizens as workers

335
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
And it's been successful

336
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,631
Taipei has a great example of

337
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
I a big major

338
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
Global metropolitan area

339
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,591
That did not have a good garbage collection system not that long ago

340
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
And I have

341
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
Slightly transformed

342
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
And it could be an example for us all

343
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,735
Which is not to say we should necessarily

344
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
Copy typing system

345
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,575
What's worked for them might not work for the US

346
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
But consider the American garbage

347
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,975
Creeping around Dawn or during work hours

348
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
Trying to be an inconspicuous

349
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Is it possible

350
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
Trying to keep trash

351
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Out of sight

352
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Out of mind

353
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
You don't really pay attention to it

354
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
But

355
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,311
Everyone should pay a lot of attention

356
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:48,479
We had to watch our garbage pile-up in our homes without taking it out to the van and had to set aside time in our days to

357
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,551
Catch the garbage and recycling trucks coming down the street

358
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,855
I bet we produce less drunk

359
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,695
But I also think if I had to hear this song twice a night 5 days a week

360
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
I would

361
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Murder
