A man walks down a dark alley

31
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
He's dressed all in black

32
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,280
Black beanie hat black gloves

33
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
He approaches a door

00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
Answers the tool into the keyhole

38
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,360
He definitely slimes the tool around inside the keyhole

39
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
Until

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
He's at

00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
Security

Has been breached

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
But only in the movies

44
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
It's because

45
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
Prospective lockpickers take note

46
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
You definitely can't do that with just a pic

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,976
We're hair pin or Paperclip

48
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
There are two tools you need to pick a lock

49
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
And one of them is usually left out

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,144
When you see people picking locks in movies

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
This is the part that

52
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704
Don't forget the tension wrench

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
This is a tension wrench

54
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
The L-shaped piece of metal with the

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,944
An L-shaped piece of metal that with one hand you insert at the bottom of the keyhole while the other hand uses the pick 2

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
Work the pins in the lock

57
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
And hold

58
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
The walk with a little bit of

59
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
Rotational tension

60
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,672
That but away is Leigh Honeywell showing our producer Sam Greenspan

61
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
How to pick a lock

62
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,792
Lee is a digital security expert and amateur lock-picking instruct

63
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
I taught a bunch of

64
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
People how to pick locks

65
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
At a feminist science

66
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
Fiction convention one year

67
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,448
I met Lee at her office in Sanford

68
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,312
We sat in the conference room among piles of tension wrenches and lock pick

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
And special practice law

70
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
Built for the picking

71
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,176
You have to push each pin up far enough

72
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
That

73
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504
You can't see that bottom part 2

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
There's two piece

75
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,416
So when you pick a lock you're using the pick and tension wrench

76
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,720
To do the work of the key you need them both

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
Into

78
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
The keyhole

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
The pursuit of lockpicking is as old as the law

80
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
Which is itself as old as civilization

81
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,640
Fire history of the world there was only one brief moments

82
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
About 70 years

83
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
Were you could put something under lock and key

84
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
A chance to save your home

85
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
And have complete

86
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,344
Unwavering certainty

87
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,136
That no Intruder could get

88
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,208
A feeling that Security Experts call

89
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
Perfect security

90
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,536
And since we lost perfect

91
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
Security in the 18th

92
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
50

93
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
It has remained elusive

94
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
Despite tremendously

95
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
Security technology

96
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,752
We have never been able to get

97
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,408
Fox go back at least as far as ancient Egypt

98
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
But in March I'm dropping a big paper

99
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,272
Theorizing that the Mesopotamians racks

100
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Ashley the creators

101
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
Of the original walk in the beach

102
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
The Egyptians then learn it

103
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,720
This is Skyler Town Schuyler town

104
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Security anthropologist

105
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,839
Research scholar

106
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,631
Kimberly Justin

107
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
Independent academic of all things related

108
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
For the Middle Ages on for hundreds of years

109
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
Locks were not very good

110
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,871
If you were poor you can have a terrible lock

111
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:37,247
And if you had some money you could have a terrible lock with some added features that night at best

112
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
Confuse a trespasser

113
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,623
They're just one false keyholes there padlocks even with false keyholes

114
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,719
False keyholes which they hoped would draw the FIFA way from the true Keyhole

115
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,583
Some locks had Falls Keyhole that even had a lock like components of fix to them

116
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,399
So it felt like they were attached to the latch mechanism

117
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
But actually weren't

118
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:02,335
Seriously the best you could do is try to confuse an intruder into picking a fake lock but as soon as the wheel key hole

119
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Was known

120
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,175
The security was pretty much nil

121
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,247
There was no law that could keep

122
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
Everyone out

123
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
And then in the 1770s

124
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,135
An English guy named Joseph bramah entered the locks

125
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:23,327
Like a wizard from the future I had to come back in time and invented the most amazing lock in the world

126
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,935
If the name Joseph sounds familiar to you Bello engineering history

127
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:34,335
Is the same Joseph bramah who invented the flush toilet and the first water pumping fire engine and pneumatic

128
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:39,967
Tree murdering machine that they would literally just rip a full grown tree out of the ground by its roots

129
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
That one wasn't as popular but

130
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Pretty cool

131
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,343
And so Joseph bramah inventor

132
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Time wizard

133
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
Tree murderer

134
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
He was really interested in locks

135
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
You need something called

136
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Appellate

137
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
The Brahma Safety Lock

138
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
Brahma disconnect

139
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
The chi

140
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
From the bull

141
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,935
So with the keys doing

142
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,751
An inner chamber of this lock

143
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
Take my word for it

144
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
Explaining how this thing works does not make

145
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Compelling radio

146
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,223
But the main thing about this lock is it added levels of complexity in between

147
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
Key and the vault

148
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,599
It's like a whole Rube Goldberg scenario plays out inside the lock

149
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
Akita

150
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,511
And, was so confident in his lock the Republic

151
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,815
Detailing exactly how it works

152
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,423
No more hiding the keyhole or shrouding the locks operation in secrecy

153
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:36,543
Rama revealed everything about the lock and still claim that it could not be opened without the key

154
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,127
And he also had another idea that would revolutionize locksmith

155
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,223
He also contributes the idea of turning this whole thing into a contest

156
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,111
Showmanship so as soon as he has a padlock version of this lock that he is very confident in

157
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:55,231
He puts it in the window of his store Piccadilly and he paints on it a message

158
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
A challenge

159
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
In Gold lettering

160
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Quote

161
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
The artist who can make an instrument

162
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
They will pick

163
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,727
Or open this lock shall receive 200 guineas the moment it is pretty

164
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,383
200 guineas in 1777 is something north of 20000 British pounds today

165
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,711
Try people actually take a real honest shot

166
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
But no one

167
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
Not even with their own tools

168
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,367
Could hack it it remained in that window for

169
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,951
70 + years challenging all comers and everybody

Promise new unbeatable lock and the hoopla surrounding it

171
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,095
Caught the attention of the British crown

172
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
And they wanted up the game

173
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
They wanted a lock

174
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
It wouldn't just be Unbreakable

175
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,287
I would also alert the owner if someone tried to get into it

176
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:46,687
The government-sponsored a contest with a hundred British pounds as reward Jeremiah chubs

Detector lock

178
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,831
And we did this work does that when you lifted one of the Tumblers up too high and see what actually trip

179
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:57,951
A latching mechanism that would hold that Tumblr up in the air too high

180
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,999
And a wooden drop back down again

181
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,071
A man that happened the Lockwood completely freeze up

182
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
Even a kid would know

183
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:10,495
Until you put a different key and rotated in the opposite direction and reset all of the Tumblers

184
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,055
Interview went to unlock a Chester of alter

00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Your front door

186
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,151
And the key to your Chubb detector lock didn't work

187
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
You would know

188
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
Did someone had tried to get into it

189
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
And

190
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
Did they had fail

191
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,111
Advertisements for the detector lock ran In The Bleak House cereal

192
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
Which red

193
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Quote

194
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
My name is Chubby

195
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
That makes the patent locks

196
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Look upon my works

197
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
EBay burglars

198
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
Despair

199
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,447
And as these newer and better locks were getting invented

200
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
The public spectacle around them

201
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
Rose to a fever pitch

202
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:48,383
At one point they offered a guy in prison parole if he could break the chop block

203
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
Breaker heat open many locks and his wife

204
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,039
And he tried and tried and tried and literally who's

205
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,599
Potential Freedom was genuinely on the line

206
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:02,463
And he had to turn the thing back in so you couldn't do it and you couldn't imagine that anyone could do it

207
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,511
And going forward

208
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,351
The names Brahma and Chubb are basically interchangeable for

209
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
Perfect security

210
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
But only until

211
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,215
The great La Concha

212
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Of 1850

213
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
Travel to London for the first intern

214
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,247
National exhibition of manufactured products

215
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,087
Back in the States Hops and made a name for himself as a sort of white hats

216
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Security consult

217
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
Heat over the banks in st. Pete

218
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,975
If I can break the lock on your safe you want to buy one of mine

219
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,815
Give it a shot when he was selling locks like

220
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Crazy

221
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
Hobbes was a natural

222
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Naturally

223
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
On day one of the exhibition

224
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,239
He publicly announced that he would pick

225
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
The chub detect

226
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,079
The one that seizes up if you pick it incorrectly

227
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,895
Hobbs successfully pick the Chubb detector lock-in

228
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
The inventor Jeremiah Chubb

229
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Wasn't convinced

230
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
He wanted to see Hobbes

231
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Do it again

232
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
So another trial

233
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
This time in front of auditors

234
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
And reporters

235
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,719
Mac Hobbs open the lock again

236
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,279
Take that job

237
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
A witness wrote that it's

238
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
25 minute

239
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,935
In the way Hobbs did it was to actually use the locker

240
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
Against itself

241
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,519
You pick it until he tripped the detector mechanic

242
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
Causing a lock to seize up

243
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,151
That would give us information about what was going on inside

244
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
And then he would pick the lock any

245
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Opposite to right

246
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
Action to reset the detect

247
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,343
He go back and forth firing and resetting the detector

248
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,927
Until the walk told him everything he needed to know about how to get it open

249
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
Miss time in 7 minutes

250
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,327
He had complete control over the Chubb lock

251
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
It has absolutely been open

252
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,447
But the Chubb detector lock was really just a warm-up

253
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
The main event

254
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
Was a Brahma Safety Lock

255
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
The one that

256
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
Talon painted on it in Gold lettering

257
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,383
What you been sitting in Joseph brahmas

258
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
Storefront window

259
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
70 years

260
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
Unbeaten

261
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
Taunting lockpickers everywhere

262
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
AC Hobbs

263
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
Threw down the gauntlet

264
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,975
So trial is conducted against the Brahma lock they give him 30 days to conduct himself against it Joseph

265
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Mama had died by the

266
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,791
And his sons were running a shop

267
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,095
Do you have the room above the store

268
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
And Hobbes got to work

269
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,959
Just want to set the lock up in a way that was easy to work on

270
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
And he could use all his own tools

271
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
Monitors would come check in on him periodically

272
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,383
If you want to bring them this thing for about 52 hours over the course of

273
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
214 days

274
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
And finally gets it over

275
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,807
And the way that he gets it open is much more like

276
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:40,159
Serta brute-forcing any kind of designed a method of building a key for it

277
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:46,815
It wasn't super elegant it couldn't be really easily repeated against the brand new one and some of his methods could have been

278
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
Prevented with some slight alterations

279
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
But still

280
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Abramowicz

281
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
Had been open

282
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
When Hobbs open that lock

283
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
I

284
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,543
Swear to you the world

285
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
Overnight

286
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
The feeling of power

287
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
Security hat evaporate

288
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
And we have never gotten it

289
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,087
Boxmas weren't able to convince the public that perfect

290
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
Security could be restored

291
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
But they did keep inventing new locks

292
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,999
One such locksmith was Linus Yale Jr

293
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,327
You've probably seen present-day locks with the name Gail on them

294
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,399
That's because he has company was able to mass-produce their locks

295
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,447
Descale that no one ever had

296
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Turlock

297
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
In the most common in the world

298
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:32,383
Nails design patented in 1851 the same year as the Great Law controversy

299
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
What's called the pin and Tumbler lock

300
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
Is the kind of lock you see everywhere

301
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,343
If you live in an apartment building is almost certainly the same style of lock do you have on your front door of your

302
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,671
Apartment building it's a kind of lock that Lee Honeywell taught me how to

303
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
How to pick this is a design it's been

304
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
Really commercial

305
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
Successful because it's super

306
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
Pretty well

307
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,471
The pin tumbler locks be up today or not too different from the pin Tumbler lock

308
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
Manufactured

309
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:04,639
In the common pin Tumbler lock is nowhere near as secure as the Beast that was the Brahma Safety Lock

310
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:09,503
Which took one of the greatest minds and locksmithing more than 50 hours to defeat

311
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,855
What about 2 hours of instruction in some practice anyone even you

312
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
Can pick a simple door lock in a few minutes

313
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,719
And if you're feeling confident in your abilities

314
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,279
You can square off against other lock Pickers

315
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:36,383
And that's our man Skyler Town competing there that a match in New York City

316
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,735
He's also competed in arguably the World Cup of locks for the Dutch open

317
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,807
Competitive locksport these days isn't so much about

318
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
Weather lockscreen

319
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
Good morning. How fast

320
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
And the locks use for competitions

321
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,023
More complicated than your average door

322
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,351
The lock on your door is so

323
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
Easily subvert

324
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Just

325
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Casual

326
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
Really I'm almost

327
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
People stores

328
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,079
With some skill and patience with a tension wrench and lock pick set

329
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
You can get it to almost anyone's house

330
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:14,527
But you don't even need that much just a few seconds with a crowbar or a brick through a window will do the job nicely

331
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
In our homes are

332
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
Incredibly

333
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
The locks in place now at Banks

334
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
Other high-security venues

335
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,255
Are light years beyond what they had them

336
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
1800

337
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
The average consumer dreadlocks

338
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
Give me a call from nearly as much

339
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
It's not that we don't need lock

340
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Badoo

341
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,751
We just don't need them to be impenetrable

342
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
For actually trusting

343
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
Is not

344
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
The walk

345
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
Wooper trusting

346
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
Is our community

347
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,991
We're trusting the sort of social order

348
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
In what the lock is now

349
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
The walk

350
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Is a social con

351
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
As much as it is a mechanic

352
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,975
And soaking a post perfect security world

353
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,047
Most of the lock that we interact with everyday don't in

354
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Inspire us

355
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
To trust them

356
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
They Inspire us

357
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
To trust

358
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Each other

359
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,263
And that's why I $15 log from your local hardware store

360
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
Will probably survive

361
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:25,183

In beautiful Downtown Oakland California

365
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,847
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

366

In a cluttered World a man-made sound

If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa
