I'm Roman Mars

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,056
As baseball fan probably know the Washington Nationals came to the US by way of Canada

29
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,104
They used to be the Montreal Expos

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,480
The team packed up and left Canada in 2005 and they left behind their name

31
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
Logo

32
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,272

Their mascot

He has a special connection to you B

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,304
It's actually my dad who had the special connection to you B

39
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,912
He died about eight years ago and his relationship with UB is something that I'm still trying to

40
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Square

41
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
Okay so

42
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
A little bit about my day

43
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
He was the boring

44
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,592
He always fell asleep at the movies Pinocchio

45
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
Toy Story

46
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,408
Dude was out cold

47
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
Family trips were playing with

48
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,016
Efficiency and Thrift as the primary object

49
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
And at our house

50
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,880
We subscribe to the one newspaper that didn't have a comic sex

51
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,720
He was definitely not into things that could be classified as

52
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,304
Fun but he had this one quiet obsession

53
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
It was rotund

54
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
Orange

55
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656

00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,728
UB

58
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
U p

59
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,288
Spelled you

60
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,848
PPI and always with an exclamation mark

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
It's French for

62
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,920
Yippee you know like

63
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
Mangia

64
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,368
Honestly haven't looked at you pee in a while

65
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
That's my sister Jessica

66
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,488
Wearing her basement while her kids are asleep and we're looking at photos of you pee on my phone

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Daiso UPI no

68
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,608
Orange fuzzy wearing cleats Expos hat

69
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
Ill-fitting axle shirt

70
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
And then like

71
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
Googly eyes

72
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
But an approachable face

73
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,152
UB looks like an orange haired bearded Lumberjack cross with a Sasquatch wearing a baseball jersey

74
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
You can picture that right

75
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,296
It was one of your kids at my sister and I started noticing our dads affection for you p

76
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,600
He light up when we see him at Expos game

77
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
I need look for him on TV

78
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
He hated when

79
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,000
The game would get cut to commercial because like that would be prime up time

80
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,328
You keep right on the side of my dad that we just didn't recognize

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
All of a sudden like you're just a

82
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
This guy who love

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
The mascot

84
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
To the point where you

85
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
You clip a picture of him

86
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
Are the newspaper

87
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
And put them on the side of the fridge

88
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,872
An article on the fridge might not sound like a big deal

89
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
Before this the only other article here

90
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
Ever posted up

91
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,760
What about Canada's new sales tax rate

92
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,296
Then suddenly it's

93
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:40,416
It should be noted that when the Expos move to DC to become the Nationals

94
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
You be switched

95
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,792
Sports and found a job with the Montreal hockey team called the Canadiens

96
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:50,656
My dad died just after that and all these years later I can't help but wonder what it was

97
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,960
About u p that spoke to his long-repressed

98
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
Whimsical

99
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
And it's not just Andrews.

100
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,384
So many grown adults can't resist hugging and posing for selfies with mascot

101
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
Even though it's just someone in a concert

102
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Darren Tran

103
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,880
Well I mean is the definition of a mascot like it it comes from actually the the French word mascot

104
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,696
A little slang word which actually means which

105
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,815
That's a jmass writer for espn.com and author of a book all about sports mascots

106
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Call yes

107
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
It's hot in here

108
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:27,263
He was also the dude inside the Mr Met costume from 1994 till 1997

109
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,919
In 1997 when Bill Clinton was visiting Shea Stadium the Secret Service pulled AJ aside while he was in his

110
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,479
Mr Met costume and told him

111
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
If you approach the president

112
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
We go for the kill shot

113
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
According to AJ the word mascot

114
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,695
Came to America in the late 1800s through a French

115
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
That was called

116
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
La mascot

117
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
I'll buy

118
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
A guy named Audria

119
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,679
The offer is about a down-on-his-luck farmer who's visited by this girl named

120
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Patina

121
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
As soon as she rolls up

122
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
Magically his crops are doing well in his life

123
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
All thanks to this mysterious woman

124
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,431
And it became very popular in the United States

125
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
Stand

126
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
Terminology

127
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,087
Kind of caught on when people realize and recognize head mascot means good luck

128
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
And this idea of a mascot

129
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,719
Fit right in with a notoriously superstitious

130
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
Is world of pro baseball

131
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:25,631
You know there was a situations where like there be a kid in the Stanwood smile at a baseball player in a slump

132
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,447
He get a base hit and he give the kid tickets for the next day

133
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:33,055
And you know and suddenly he's going a big hitting streak and so he would be like

134
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,943
Hey I want this kid to hang around all the time and that's kind of where mascots became these the human good luck charm

135
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
Like John the Orangemen

136
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
Who was well

137
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,575
A Man Who Sold oranges outside the stadium at Harvard

138
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
And Yale adopted

139
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,207
Handsome Dan Bulldog they walked out onto the field before games

140
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:54,047
Anything that was sort of a round at the time of a team's hot streak

141
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,119
Could and would be claimed as a mascot

142
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,215
It was pretty much all animals and bystanders until the second World War

143
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,287
That's when one baseball game altered the idea

144
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
Mascots in sports

145
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,175
Yeah this game took place in Hawaii and it was an exhibition game made up of servicemen

146
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,503
Pitching was kind of a lanky goofy looking guy

147
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
Find the name of Mac

148
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Patent

149
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,695
The legendary Joe DiMaggio stepped up to the plate and hits massive home run off

150
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,023
The Story Goes it's a Baldwin into the Pacific Ocean

151
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
And packing just snaps

152
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Ski jumps off the mound

153
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
This is the picture okay he jumps off the mound

154
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
And runs after DiMaggio

155
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
People thought he was like going to attack him or something but actually he just

156
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
Ran behind him mimicking his home run trot

157
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
And the crowd just went nuts

158
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,783
So he kept doing this act throw those servicely exhibition games

159
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
A picture

160
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,135
His dick was sort of a mix of Jim Carrey in Ace Ventura

161
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
Meets the dance moves of your drunk uncle at a wedding

162
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
Meats like a Parisian mine

163
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,351
And when the war was over packing stop being a picture and was hired by the

164
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
The Cleveland Indians

165
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,447
To do his thing at home game to help dry and cracked

166
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,823
It was the first time a mascot did more than just stand around being lucky

167
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
He entertained people

168
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,943
God knows people need that a baseball game

169
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,039
So now thanks to pack and we had this idea of a mascot as a diversion

170
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:23,903
But there's still a big evolutionary step to get to the mascots we know today

171
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
Yeah that the turning point

172
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,255
Certainly has to begin and end with the chicken

173
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:33,375
The San Diego chicken who can really only be described as a dude in a chicken suit

174
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,655
In 1974

175
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:41,055
The San Diego radio station KGB FM higher. College kid by the name of Ted Ginn newest where at

176
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
Chicken suit and do promotion for the radio station

177
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Ingenuous got into it

178
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Like

179
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
Really into it

180
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
The chicken have bravado

181
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,855
He had Swagger he was like an obnoxious frat boy and a bird

182
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
He danced on the field at San Diego Padres game

183
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,487
Grab people's beer and pretend to chug it

184
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,327
And the Padres were such a bad team that people started

185
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,887
Going just so they could see the chicken perform

186
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,215
And that's where the San Diego chicken kind of was born he was this

187
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
This marketing tool for the radio station that kind of

188
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,335
Suddenly became bigger than the team itself

189
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
She was eventually fired from the radio station because

190
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
On such a life of its own

191
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,015
Seokjin ules got his own chicken

192
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Keppra forum

193
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
The station actually suit him

194
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Embossed

195
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
Because it's you can't

196
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
You can copyright the idea of

197
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
Guy in chicken suit

198
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Kids

199
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,303
You can't copyright the idea of a guy

200
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
In a chicken suit

201
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
The chicken was a big deal

202
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
Even though he wasn't in

203
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
Official team mascot

204
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
Kid become a Nike

205
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,055
He created the modern mascot movement

206
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,919
Even so by the late seventies the mascot scene was still pretty Barren by today's standards

207
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,223
Only a handful of baseball teams

208
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,503
Technically had Mass

209
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,807
Like the Philadelphia Phillies

210
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,879
They had a pair of characters called Phil and Phyllis

211
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Steel prop

212
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
They weren't mascots they were props

213
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,743
Picture if you dressed a couple of those

214
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,327
Big Boy Restaurant statues in colonial garb

215
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
They were these big

216
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
Plaster characters that would

217
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,959
Kind of waddle out for the national anthem or if there's a homerun

218
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,311
So when the Philly saw with the chicken was doing in San Diego

219
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
They were like

220
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
We got to get us some of that

221
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:25,503
The Phillies found someone to custom design a mascot to entertain their fans

222
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
And before she came on board

223
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
They warned her that

224
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,623
Fans in Philly could be a little

225
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
Unforgiving

226
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
They said well we just want you to know

227
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Our crowd

228
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
In Philadelphia booed

229
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
The Easter Bunny

230
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
Best designer Bonnie Erickson

231
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,447
And The Bling the Easter Bunny story is actually an urban legend

232
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,799
But Eagles fans did one spelled Santa with snowballs during the game

233
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,103
Bonnie had no experience

234
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
The Sports World when she took the gig

235
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,759
She and her husband and business partner Wade Harris and had just started their own design outfit

236
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
And they got

237
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Phillies job

238
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
Thanks for recommendation by Bonnie's

239
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
Former employer

240
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
Jim Henson

241
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
V jimin

242
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,535
Muppets Fraggle Rock Sesame Street

243
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,351
Bonnie Erickson designed Miss Piggy

244
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:16,959
In The Muppet Show hecklers Statler and Waldorf

245
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,775
I wonder if there's anything she is

246
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,079
Choosing what show to be on

247
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,431
She also worked with Henson on making life-size version of the Sesame Street care

248
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
Doctors for their Sesame Street on ice

249
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,343
So she knew how to make a costume that people could perform and move

250
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
Which was A New Concept when it came to mask

251
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:41,023
Chobani got to work on this new mascot in the meantime the Phillies had to find someone to

252
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,351
Stuff inside of it and face those Santa hat clean crowns

253
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,703
They needed the lowest man on the totem pole the intern to raise his hand and say yes

254
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
Message Dave Raymond who was that intern

255
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
He was brought on board to do things like

256
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,103
County all star game voting

257
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,967
He had no background as a performer aside from some dabbling with

258
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Disco

259
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
Nevertheless

260
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,319
She would be the performer inside this new mask

261
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,719
Because of some delays we didn't see the costume until the very night that I was going to wear it end and that that's when I started getting

262
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,559
Little bit distress because I started realizing everyone else thought this was a stupid idea

263
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,631
And and I was truly going to be thrown to the wolves

264
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,215
The Phillies weren't even promoting the fact that they were getting a new mascot

265
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
In case the whole thing just

266
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
Completely backfire

267
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:30,431
They can do like mascot mascot did you see a mascot I didn't say mascot but I was reassured when I first

268
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,759
I opened the box and I was blown away with how

269
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
How perfect it look

270
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
The Phillie Phanatic was born

271
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,975
If This Were a superhero movie this would be when the dramatic music comes on

272
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,815
But the fanatic is definitely not a comic book superhero

273
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:54,495
It's all green fur like very furry fuzzy fur

274
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,543
Very very large and rotund

275
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,407
Pear-shaped body with a huge belly and a kind of a duck butt

276
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,967
Stirrup socks Phillies hat in the Phillies Jersey

277
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,783
Perfect you know that's not all make sense

278
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:12,927
No no it doesn't make any sense that the Phillies mascot would be a big googly eyed monster

279
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,279
But it turns out that every part of the fanatic is like

280
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Omastar

281
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Glass in mask

282
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
For starters

283
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
He's green

284
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,447
Not the standard Phillies red

285
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
Right exactly

286
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Police always easy to

287
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
To spot The Fanatic in any of these

288
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
And the Duck Butt

289
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,223
And a pear-shaped body no matter how you move in that costume if you're a human being and you put one leg in front of the other

290
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
That costume looks funny

291
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:42,111
Now when I look at the fanatic it's so clear that there's Muffet DNA

292
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,183
Even the placement of a cartoon googly eyes

293
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,511
Is something that Bonnie learned from her time designing Muppets

294
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,815
You are asking for all my secrets

295
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
Well if you put ice

296
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Tie on a fish

297
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Figures

298
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Face

299
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
They will look older

300
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
He put them down closer to

301
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
To the nose

302
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,543
They'll probably look younger and more childlike

303
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,871
Plus there's other mascot first that she borrowed from the Muppets

304
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
Like she designed the fanatic with licensing

305
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
In merchandising

306
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
Toys t-shirts

307
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
And like all the characters

308
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,111
The Fanatic even has his own origin

309
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
He's supposedly from the Galapagos Islands

310
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
The Paddock is Goofy

311
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:23,583
You know he rubber ball dude head or rip off the hat of someone cheering for the wrong team

312
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
And usually he gets away with it

313
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,471
It's just damn near impossible to get irate with a fuzzy green thing

314
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:34,079
The one time he did get pummeled by Tommy was sort of the coach of the LA Dodgers

315
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
What I had

316
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
Had it with the fanatic on TuneIn

317
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,455
That's the quickest time he's moved all year

318
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
We got a Mark that down

319
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,575
The quickest Tommy Lasorda moving

320
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
1988

321
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
Was after the

322
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
Philly Phanatic

323
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,791
And of course that just made the Phillies fans love him even more

324
00:13:54,047 --> 00:14:00,191
Dave Raymond play the Philly Phanatic from that first game in 1978 until 1993

325
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,007
He only ever missed five home games

326
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,871
Now all but three major league baseball teams have mascots and most of them are big

327
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
Infirmary

328
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
Goofy in a googly eyes

329
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
Everyone sense with an addict

330
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
China

331
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
In a way copying

332
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
Intercourse Bonnie

333
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
Captioning work

334
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
After we did The Fanatic

335
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,791
The next one that we were asked to do because of the popularity of the character

336
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,375
I was for Montreal for the Expos

337
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
Yep Bonnie Erickson also created you

338
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,263
And when I told her about the inordinate amount of a

339
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
Affection my dad had for the mascot

340
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:42,431
She recalled once seeing a big Burly guy coming to the Expo stadium with some up dolls in the shop

341
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,015
Dieta position them so that they would have their heads

342
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Sticking out

343
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
As if they couldn't breathe

344
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
If they fart

345
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647
Skip it and I thought that was very touching

346
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,023
The mascot still lives in the sort of limbo between the two worlds he's not quite part of the team but not

347
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,071
Quite part of the fanbase either

348
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
I think that's the power for mascot

349
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:06,495
What fan of a team wouldn't want to be able to have that freedom to mock the other team and get a response

350
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,431
I think a big part of it for my dad was this aspect of living vicariously

351
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
UB what's your spirit animal

352
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,295
The Brad Pitt to his Edward Norton

353
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,111
You be good belly slide across the Expos dugout

354
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,695
Take me up to task will the whole stadium cheer them on

355
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,791
Steal a kiss from Celine Dion after a show-stopping rendition of

356
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
Oh Canada

357
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
UPS have fun dude

358
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
I can see that

359
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Maybe

360
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
Secretly

361
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
My dad was to

362
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:19,199
