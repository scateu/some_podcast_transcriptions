Alright,

31
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,024
About 10 miles south of San Francisco toward the airport

32
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
There's a town

33
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
Coldcalm

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,192
I have never been to, before but it's cool you can take the train right here

Mets producer Avery trufelman

00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,128
Oh my God right behind the train station

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
Already

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
Is big

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
Rolling

00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248

73% of the land in coma

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
Is covered

46
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
With graveyard

47
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024

48
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,096
Rose and Rose

49
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
Big gravestones

50
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,032
There are 17 full size cemeteries together in one town

51
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,080
18 if you include that simatai

52
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
This is

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
Huge

54
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
It is a city of the Dead

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
What's known as a necropsy

56
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,088
We claim to be the only necropolis

57
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,440
And the United States anyway the only city

58
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,720
That is

59
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
Primarily dedicated to

60
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
To cemetery

61
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
This is Maureen O'Connor

62
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,888
President of the Colma historical Association

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
It doesn't mean that there are a lot of cities that don't have cemeteries within their boundaries but nothing of the concentration

64
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
That we have

65
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,408
And, truly looks like a sprawling City

66
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,480
A landscape of mausoleums and monuments in

67
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Towers and tombstones

68
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
The glint in the Sun

69
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,600
For as far as the eye can see

70
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
But it is eerily quiet

71
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,000
You're the dead outnumber the living thousand to one

72
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,304
We have 1600 living

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
Citizen

74
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,144
And we have about one and a half million

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,192
Residents who live underground

76
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
Or in Mazatlan

77
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
Maureen talks about her dead Neighbors

78
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Everliving neighbors with

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
The same vocabulary

80
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,408
Like when she referred to John Daly

81
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
The long deceased Dairy mag

82
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
John Daly

83
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,808
For him Daly City is named one of our neighbors

84
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
She's a lot of famous neighbor

85
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
Like Joe DiMaggio

86
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
And Levi Strauss of Levi jeans

87
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,744
Tina Turner's dog is in the Pet Sematary

88
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,328
They're all around and Maureen's house is literally sandwich

89
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Between two

90
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Cemeteries

91
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,192
I live across from the Italian Cemetery

92
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:57,568
And the front of my house and then the back of my backyard borders with Japanese

93
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,920
And then I have to human Neighbors on east and west

94
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
The official Town motto of coma in

95
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,808
It's great to be alive

96
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,368
In, it's great to be alive

97
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
Coma had many lives

98
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
Before it became

99
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
The modern necropolis

100
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,815
Before it was even called coma

101
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
In the 1800's it was rich farmland

102
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,423
The cut all the moisture off the bay

103
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
And most of the vegetables

104
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
San Francisco work from there

105
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:32,895
Another point it was known mostly for hog farming and at another point it was known for cultivating flowers

106
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:38,783
Meanwhile a few miles north in San Francisco proper people were pouring in because of the gold rush

107
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
The population was booming

108
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
And so was the death ray

109
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,975
Well certainly there was an enormous amount of death at that time and just because

110
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,047
There were no antibiotics people died of stuff that

111
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,095
You wouldn't even think of dying of now

112
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,399
San Francisco Cemetery started

113
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Develop

114
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
And starting in 1887

115
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,519
Religious groups and organizations began

116
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
One by one

117
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
To buy plots of land south of the city

118
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,151
To create new burial grounds

119
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
Which eventually covered over to square miles

120
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,831
In 1924 the cemetery Scott together they decided to incorporate

121
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,159
Is 2.2 square miles officially became a town

122
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Pet Sematary town

123
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
Call Mondale

124
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,791
Which in 1941 would be renamed

125
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Coma

126
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,679
And all of this was happening in the context of a much bigger change

127
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
American burial practices

128
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,847
For a long time the dead used to be buried in little squares are churchyards on Dusky plots in the middle

129
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Motown

130
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
Graves were all around it was no big deal

131
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,807
Municipal burying-ground we're right downtown and they were relatively small crowded places

132
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
With

133
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,135
Really nothing much by way of

134
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
Landscape design they were just

135
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
Beyond the lands surrounding

136
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
A church

137
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
This is Keith Wagner

138
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,119
Professor of architectural history at the University of Oregon

139
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,519
And in his book cemeteries he talks about how these tiny plane graveyard where hubs of activity

140
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
You might find the

141
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,639
Plumber or a bricklayer or a carpenter

142
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,711
Seated at a cemetery waiting for someone to come along and

143
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Poem

144
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,879
Farmers would graze their cows and cemeteries because many people believe that the grass grown in churchyards

145
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Burial ground

146
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,463
Who's richer in made for sweeter milk

147
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,791
Prostitutes even would sometimes be found in

148
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,119
Burial ground so these were going to open public spaces

149
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,167
In towns and cities

150
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,007
Many of which didn't have much by way of alternative

151
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
In public spaces

152
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,103
But by the 1820s and 30s

153
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
Couple things happen that change

154
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
How barrels work

155
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
Firstly

156
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
Is a series outbreak

157
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,783
Disease and cities were hit with waves

158
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
Of typhoid

159
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,391
Cholera and yellow fever and it was just unsanitary

160
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,951
How to keep the deceased so close to the living

161
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,815
Also cities were growing in downtown real estate was becoming more volume

162
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
Graduate in the United States

163
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,959
Land of the living in the Land of the Dead begin

164
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
To separate

165
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
Gravesites ended up

166
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
Far away from the city

167
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,407
This model of a rural burial

168
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
Separate from the city

169
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,247
Took off in America in the 1830s

170
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
When Mount Auburn Cemetery

171
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,599
Open outside of Cambridge Massachusetts

172
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
Walmart Auburn was

173
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,255
What was called and what is still called a rural cemetery

174
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303
What that meant was that it wasn't

175
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
Smack dab in the center of a town

176
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
Also it was one of the first cemeteries to

177
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
Actually be called a cemetery

178
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
At all

179
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
Previously they'd been called

180
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,847
You're burying grounds are burial grounds or churchyard

181
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,687
Cemetery was a Greek word meaning sleeping chamber

182
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
And just that word Cemetery

183
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,551
So romantic and euphemistic

184
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,391
Death had once been deeply enmeshed in everyday life

185
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,207
Americans had home funerals in their front parlor

186
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,535
Encounter modest tombstones daily and their Town squares

187
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,887
Mount Auburn Mayberry something removed from normal existence

188
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
Rural Cemetery

189
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Stately

190
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
They look

191
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
Like they were a world apart

192
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
Mount Auburn was

193
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Was and still is

194
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Beautiful

195
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,919
With Emerald grassy Hills in manicured hedges

196
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,271
There are statues of weeping angels in Egyptian obelisk

197
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,343
All connected with winding walking path

198
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
So it was much more Artful

199
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,791
Landscape modeled on the English garden tradition of

200
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
Picturesque landscapes

201
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,447
As opposed to just simply a flat piece of ground with a bunch of stones

202
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
In a lined up with in it

203
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,335
This new style Mark the beginning of the rural cemetery movement in America

204
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
It would go on to influence the design of

205
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
Public spaces more broadly

206
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,759
Because this is at a time when a lot of cities didn't have

207
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
Public parks or botanical gardens or museums

208
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
These

209
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
Cemeteries none

210
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
Served as the model

211
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,743
For some of our nation's first public parks

212
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,815
Such as Central Park in New York which followed that

213
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
Picturesque Garden approach that

214
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,935
Was first seen in our cemeteries it was later picked up for

215
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,775
College campuses Suburban subdivisions

216
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
Many other applications

217
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,431
The cemeteries in Colma where directly inspired by the Mount Auburn model as well

218
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,831
They were places to go to have picnics and amble around and get away from the smog and soot of neighboring same

219
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
San Francisco

220
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,999
If the city of the living was designed for Speed and efficiency in business the City of the Dead was instead

221
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,303
Dead understood as a kind of quiet

222
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
Peaceful Arcadia

223
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
A kind of

224
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,983
Evocation of paradise or Heaven on Earth where one would take ones

225
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
Eternal reward

226
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
Oh and about that eternity thing

227
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
That's very

228
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
American

229
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
Americans

230
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
Have a

231
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:01,087
Rather distinct practice of holding to a burial in perpetuity

232
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,927
You don't find burial in perpetuity in that many other places

233
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,231
Buy burial in perpetuity means

234
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
Plot of land

235
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,303
That is yours forever and ever until the end of

236
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:17,471
Which is different than in say Argentina or France or Italy or any number of other countries around the world

237
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
We're families of the deceased typically lease

238
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
A burial plot

239
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,615
It could be for 5 or 10 years to a hundred years

240
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
And

241
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,735
If the family doesn't maintain that lease then

242
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,783
The Remains are

243
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Jug up

244
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,623
And our disinterred and

245
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
What is left is often

246
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Burned

247
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
The family is

248
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,303
Given the ashes in the plots are used for new burials

249
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
This almost never happens in the United

250
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
American cemeteries would rather double up on Berry

251
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
Or do above ground burials then

252
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
Dig up her man

253
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
That's just taboo

254
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,407
And that's why it was so strange in the early 20th century

255
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,967
When almost all of San Francisco's dad

256
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
Were dug up and evicted

257
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
To make room

258
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
For the living

259
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
Which brings us back

260
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
The graveyards of Colma

261
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
What happened in 1900

262
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
Was that the Board of Supervisors of the County of San Francisco decided that they did not want

263
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Want any

264
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,727
Expansion of the cemeteries were already in San Fran

265
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,567
That's Maureen O'Connor again of the Kona Historical Society

266
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,663
So the legislation wasn't there would be no new burials and Sam

267
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
San Francisco

268
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
And that went into effect in

269
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
1901

270
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
Sono new burial

271
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,671
Not meant the existing cemeteries didn't have a reliable source of Revenue

272
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:47,327
I'm so the cemeteries fell into disrepair and became these tiny wastelands for vagabond

273
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
Wells and Grave robbers

274
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
And also they were gross

275
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
So in 1914

276
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
Another ordinance kick them out

277
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,311
They passed legislation that said

278
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:02,687
Not only no new burials but these cemeteries just look off all they thought they were disease-ridden

279
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
So the city said

280
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,807
The bodies have to be disinterred and moved

281
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:15,231
From 1937 into the 1940s most of the bodies from San Francisco were dug up and moved Tacoma

282
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,303
Roughly 150000 bodies in total

283
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
To move a body with a headstone

284
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,143
Cost the family $10

285
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
If there was no money

286
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Unknown X

287
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
The bodies were put into mask

288
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Musgraves

289
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
In coma

290
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
But like respectful ones

291
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,895
Cuz when you think of mass grave you off

292
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
I think I'm a sex

293
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Execution

294
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,991
And it was not that kind of

295
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
I was a much gentler

296
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
Respectful process

297
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
The deceased

298
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
In the mass Graves

299
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,207
We're blessed and memorialized and accounted for in Wrecker

300
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
And their headstones

301
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
Where we used as building material

302
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
Well

303
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,167
The mass grave headstones ended up along Ocean Beach

304
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
You'll see a lot of headstones out

305
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
No

306
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Yes

307
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
They were used

308
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
To keep from erosion

309
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,919
If you find yourself in Buena Vista Park in the heart of San Francisco

310
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,759
Look at the pavestones letting the trails and the street gutters

311
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,087
And you'll see that a lot of them are Cemetery headstone

312
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,671
These headstones sometimes faded fragments of them

313
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
Sometimes completely intact

314
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,255
All over the city

315
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Hiding in plain sight

316
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,143
And they are the closest contact most San franciscans have with Cemetery

317
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,471
There are only two graveyard left in the entire city

318
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,543
Death of the fact of life most Urban dwellers don't

319
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,079
See I don't think about

320
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:39,199
Where is Downing, Maureen confronts her mortality every time she looks at her window

321
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,247
I looked out on the cemeteries

322
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
And I think

323
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:49,183
You know these people are resting in peace and sometimes I feel overwhelmed by all the things that I have to do

324
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:54,303
But the day that I wake up that I don't have anything to do I'm probably going to be moving into

325
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
To a cemetery

326
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:03,775
Most people aren't sandwiched between two cemeteries and we don't really think about the question of what will happen

327
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
Our bodies after we die

328
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
I asked

329
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,943
The question and very often people are at like a little taken aback either they haven't

330
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
Thought about it are they

331
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
No I haven't made any plans

332
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
I certainly haven't made plans

333
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
Chances are you haven't either

334
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,695
I've no idea what will happen to my body after I die

335
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,511
What kind of unusual on the course of history

336
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,327
It was indeed the case that

337
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
Yes people

338
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
Largely knew where they were buried

339
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
Professor Keith egner says that

340
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,055
Prior to the Civil War Americans assumed they'd end up in their family plots

341
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
Counter-charge

342
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,639
And other parents and children would be buried there

343
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,943
To that is no longer the case

344
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,039
We move you know from job to job from town to town

345
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,719
We frequently encourage our children to and I'll go out and explore the world and we can. We don't really know where we're going to be

346
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
The ending up

347
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,839
Which is why today many people have opted not to be buried at all

348
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,655
Cremation has become increasingly popular

349
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,495
Again to our own time and this brought with it

350
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,287
A number of

351
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,079
New building types

352
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,359
Crematoria

353
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
But also

354
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
The public mausoleums

355
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:19,295
Where you have a small box containing an urn with ashes

356
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
But with cremation

357
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,415
You don't need a connection to one place

358
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,767
I should don't have to stay displayed in a columbarium or mausoleum

359
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,839
They can be scattered anywhere you've ever lived

360
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
Or wanted to live

361
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,935
If your family and friends live all over the world they can

362
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Each have a part of you

363
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:42,079
And there are these services that you can order where ashes can be compressed into a diamond

364
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,175
And wander around someone's neck or turned into a hand blown glass paperweight

365
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
So there's

366
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,039
A kind of brake I think on going

367
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,855
Over the course of the last hundred years or more

368
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
In which

369
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
People were

370
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
Perhaps much more rooted to the land

371
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,047
Both in life and especially

372
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Death

373
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
By virtue of

374
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Burial and

375
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
Knowing where they were going to be buried

376
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
Then we are now

377
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
San Francisco's 19 century residents could never have guessed that they'd be evicted and relocated miles away

378
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,967
Away from their Hometown to a city of the Dead

379
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,271
Their headstones strewn about the

380
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
Parks and beaches

381
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Of the city

382
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Of the living

383
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:40,959
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Avery trufelman with Lani Hall Emmett Fitzgerald and me Roman Mars

This episode was inspired in part by our friends at kuow in Seattle they have a new podcast called terrestrial where he

388
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Each episode explores

389
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,351
A personal question to the lens of climate change in the environment

390
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
Ashley Ahearn the host of the show

391
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,983
The whole episode about what we should do with our bodies when we die

392
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
In light of our changing landscape

393
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
Miche features this

394
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Katrina Spade

395
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:23,455
My name is Katrina spade and and the founder and director of the urban death project

396
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,295
Katrina's designed what she called a recomposition center

397
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,647
A facility where it would be possible to compost multiple human body

398
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,231
I realize this is pretty out there for a lot of

399
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,303
I know the Catholic side of my family would probably freak

400
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,119
Listen to the way she envisions one of these Center

401
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
Remember it doesn't exist yet

402
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
This is just how she imagined

403
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,615
Can you open the doors to the recomposition center the first thing you see

404
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,175
Is this three-story concrete

405
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,479
Form it ends you can see the top of it

406
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,783
And wrapping around that core

407
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
Is a series of ramps

408
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
That's what a commander

409
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:10,047
Rest of the concept of the recomposition center and some other ideas about the future of death

410

We're immersed

422
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,023
The cluttered World a man-made sound

Talk to us

426
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,383
It is a creation of Sonic trash

427
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,455
That's Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

428
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,039
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

429
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
To make them more human

430
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
Turn the living room lights on

431
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719

432
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255

Okay

435
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,471
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taken away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

436
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,287
Makes for a much more natural experience

437
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,335
Turn the living room lights on

438
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,431

469
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:13,087
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked to play superhero in a movie

470
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,440
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

471
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,768
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

472
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
A dad

473
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,144

476
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:37,920

Was found dead in my private gym

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,856
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse

479
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:50,208
The cops think that I had something to do with it now

480
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
I need to clear my name

481
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
