Subscribe to family goes wherever you get your podcast and find out why they say

24

Every house is haunted

25
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,840
This is 99% invisible

26
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,936
There's a subgenre of

27
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,496
Kid videos on YouTube that are named things like

28
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,312
My toddler Master the iPhone &

29
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,616
Baby Works iPad perfectly

30
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:30,368
Some of these video titles also say things like must see

31
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
In all caps

32
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,952
But like all things that same IC

33
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
It's not true

34
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,304
You can totally do without seeing these videos

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
Oh you want to change the background

36
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
Blue

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,192
Mostly it's a bunch of babies drooling and poking and iPhones

38
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,312
These tiny drooling iPhone stalkers are actually able to execute commands

39
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,360
Open up programs they want to use

40
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,152
Play games and take photos

41
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,456
And despite what we parents believe

42
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,760
It isn't because our kids are smart

43
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,344
Smart manager

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,648
Smart picture seems pretty smart

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,440
That's what these are Louisa back

46
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,744
The mostly it's just that iPhone

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,048
Actually computers in general

48
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,864
I just incredibly easy to use

49
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,984
Today's user interface in the modern computer is what I called Grunt and point

50
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
It's

51
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
Very primitive communication

52
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592
So that's why I call it grants

53
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,128
That's Christina engelbart

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
Her father Doug engelbart

55
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,320
How to vastly different vision for what computers could be than these super simple devices that toddlers

56
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,672
Doug engelbart division required us to actually

57
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
Learn stuff

58
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
In order to really

59
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,816
Push the envelope of

60
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,888
Of human Effectiveness an intellectual effectiveness

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,520
You don't want to be confined to just a very small vocabulary of Grants

62
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
NCLEX

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,848
So you want to actually have a full language

64
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,176
Doug engelbart was a Pioneer in his field

65
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,504
And his main goal wasn't to make computers that toddlers could

66
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,832
He wanted them to be as powerful as possible

67
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,672
And imagine that if we took the time to learn how to use their devices

68
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,232
If we became fluent in their language

69
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,584
Their potential to make us smarter more efficient humans would be huge

70
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,472
Doug engelbart who passed away in 2013

71
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,568
Grew up during the Great Depression on a small Farmstead near Portland Oregon

72
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:29,152
Do-it-yourself is a radar technician in the Navy during World War II

73
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
He was a West Coast Optima

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,040
Who studied at UC Berkeley and was influenced by the 1960s counterculture

75
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
Would you later had his own lab he made his researchers attend personal development seminars what they talked about

76
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
Feelings of Life philosophies

77
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,328
It is time Engelbert ideas for lofty and unique

78
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Idealistic

79
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
My father was considered a coupe

80
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,568
I knew what he was not widely respected

81
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
Or even widely known

82
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,200
Engelbart's name may not be widely known

83
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,552
But if you work at a computer you use one of his inventions everyday

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
I don't know why they call it a mouse

85
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Sometimes I apologize

86
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,416
Started that way

87
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
We never to change

88
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,815
Best single bars showing off his revolutionary invention in 1968

89
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
Computer mouse

90
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Engelbart's Mouse

91
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
3 buttons

92
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
Do you would have added more if he'd been able to fit.

93
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,591
End it was meant to be used in conjunction with another device

94
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
It's called the key set

95
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:37,503
Which looks like a small five key piano one key for each finger and was controlled by your left

96
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
This device over here

97
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
We always have to

98
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Justifying

99
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Explain it

100
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Provides

101
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
For you

102
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
The one-handed football

103
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
What you can do with a keyboard

104
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,471
The idea was that with your left hand on the key set in your right hand on the mouth

105
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,871
You could do almost everything that you would need to do without moving your hand back to the keyboard including

106
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,455
Typing out characters of the alphabet and executing shortcut commands

107
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,807
The beyond the shortcut commands that we use now with a keyboard

108
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,391
Engelbart's Mausam Ki set opened up a larger vocabulary

109
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,207
We could use when communicating with a computer

110
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
So

111
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,559
So we could do like my dad

112
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Dad

113
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
Your left hand

114
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,703
I visited Christina engelbart at the dog and go bite Institute

115
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,263
Which is an educational Consulting NC

116
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
Petition that aim to promote his ideas

117
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
It's house at Stanford Research into

118
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
Keytruda Menlo Park

119
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
The very place where her father and his

120
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
Collaborator Bill English

121
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Built the first

122
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Prototypes

123
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
Mouse in 19

124
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
64

125
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,695
Christina showed me the key set and I tried to get a feel for what it would be like

126
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Type my name with

127
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
So there 26 letters to the house

128
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
That and what's the

129
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
So what

130
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
Number one

131
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
I mean you can go

132
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Basically eat

133
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Finger and the key

134
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
He said is assigned numerical value

135
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
My thumb is assigned to one

136
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
And my pointer to

137
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:13,247
So that one is three I need to press down my thumb and pointer because they add up

138
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
Then we map numbers

139
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
2 letters

140
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Exactly

141
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Right

142
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,263
With each letter map to number aiding one you can imagine that it gets harder once you reach the middle

143
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
Letters of the alphabet

144
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,383
Yeah I have no idea of the top of my head what number of the alphabet o is

145
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,735
Right well there's a chart you can hang up next to a desk to reference

146
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
What number each letter is

147
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
But the point is all of this take

148
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Subtract

149
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,951
Still I could imagine how with a lot of repetition you could get fast

150
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:04,191
Doug engelbart felt his mouth and key said would allow us to communicate with computers more fluidly and the fish

151
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:10,591
Efficiently you know it sounds pretty hard to learn as a single bite was against user-friendly devices

152
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,991
But you just believe that if we were willing to put time into learning computers they could do so much more fat

153
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,855
He thought they could help us communicate and collaborate to become better humans and more effective

154
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:29,279
So that meant how can you make humans in groups and organizations be

155
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,143
Dramatically more effective how effective can you make them is there a limit

156
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,543
Maybe the idea that computers can help us collaborate doesn't sound that crazy now but Engelbert was working at a time

157
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,127
When most people thought of computers at Giant calculators

158
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
Their purpose was

159
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
Automate tasks

160
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,039
And in my father's Paradigm why would you ever automate

161
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,903
How you do things now a computer affords a whole new way of working

162
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
What way would you work if you weren't

163
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,767
Limited to the old technology

164
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
In the early sixties

165
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,143
Angle backup funding to start his own life or he could have

166
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,935
Experiment with all of his ideas

167
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
Is lab hosted one of the

168
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
3 centers of the arpanet

169
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Which is one of the

170
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
The key ancestor

171
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
Pictures of the internet

172
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
Engelbert actually helped invent the internet

173
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,479
And throughout the sixties and early seventies

174
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,807
Is group building Tire online collaboration

175
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,391
And included video conferencing and collaborative text

176
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Editing

177
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
Curious presenting those things and what

178
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
Became known as the mother of all demos

179
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,607
I need to know what terminal you are on Bill

180
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,935
Okay I'd like to have him see my texts

181
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,031
Cancel the special thing if I table 13 will switch

182
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
Switch

183
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,639
Over Sonia's display he sees my text

184
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
Executed

185
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
And sure enough it does

186
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
But what's that

187
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Running around

188
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,575
Well he's okay my texts he like have something to say about it

189
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,415
The reason people call it the mother of all demos is that in it

190
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,255
Engelbart show the world so many revolutionary ideas

191
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
The mouse of course

192
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,375
But also a bunch of things that didn't catch on until decades later

193
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:13,983
The time most people hadn't even heard of personal Computing let alone the internet

194
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,311
And here was Doug engelbart demonstrating the ancestor

195
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
Pictures of tools

196
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Like Skype

197
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,407
Screen sharing in Google doc editing

198
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
In the 1960s

199
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,295
Despite all of this by the early 1970s

200
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,879
Engelbart's lab ran out of funding to continue his research

201
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,535
Much like is three-button Mouse and key set his other ideas were seen as interesting but complicated

202
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
And not particularly marketable

203
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,655
And meanwhile another computer Visionary had under the

204
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
15

205
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,751
One that unlike the ganga Bart you've probably heard of

206
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
A guy by the name of Steve Jobs

207
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
Steve Jobs was never satisfied

208
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,175
With the first of the second Raven 210

209
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,967
Pass and making something simple

210
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:03,135
That's Larry tesler Apple from 1980 to 1997 S&P and chief scientist

211
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:08,511
How simple you made it he would come and say that's pretty good but I think you can make it simpler than that

212
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,583
And then he would leave us like will how

213
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,167
Once in a while he would make a suggestion but usually he just walked away

214
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
And we had to figure out a way to make it simpler

215
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,567
One thing jobs wanted to simplify was engelbart's Mouse and key set

216
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,663
Jobs had first seen the mouth and key set at Xerox Parc

217
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,503
Which was The Cutting Edge Computing research facility at the time

218
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,599
In the 1970s when engelbart's lab started to disband

219
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,183
A lot of engelbart's researchers and some of his prototype

220
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
Ended up at Xerox Parc

221
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
Jobs

222
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,775
Complicated to use he dismissed the case at all together

223
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:58,175
Do Apple employees saying that the mouse Apple was developing with only have one button

224
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,223
Years Apple held onto it's one button Mouse

225
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
Even as competitors developed

226
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Two-button mice

227
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,391
He was very attached to it considered including engelbart's

228
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,695
Keyset companion to the mouse

229
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,023
It was too costly clunky and complicated to learn

230
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,839
An apple we wanted people to come into the store

231
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,167
Look at the software try it out figure it out

232
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
In the first

233
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
2 minutes

234
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,055
And and plunk down a credit card and take the computer home

235
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
And

236
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,639
It wasn't okay to say will take it home

237
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,991
And work on it every day for several hours a day and a six months you'll be really good at it

238
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
And suddenly

239
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
Computers were for everyone

240
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
Even better

241
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
Beautiful that's a beautiful

242
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,511
And that it's helped a lot of people

243
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,559
That's Christina engelbart again

244
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
Problem is

245
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Gwen

246
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
That's

247
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
The whole mission

248
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,799
Christina thinks that when we prioritize simple user-friendly devices over more complex learnable ones

249
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
We limit ourselves

250
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,639
And we might miss out on important ideas

251
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
And for a while at least

252
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
Steve Jobs did exactly that

253
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,879
When job showed engelbart the brand new Apple computer Christina said that her dad responded like this

254
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
My dad said will G1 about

255
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
Communication to

256
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
You know today

257
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
Networking

258
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
In other words

259
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,655
Document sharing video chatting and all the collaborative stuff that was excited about

260
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,495
Brindle Bard collaboration was the most important thing

261
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,799
Computers needed to connect

262
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
Pepper jobs

263
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
At this point anyway

264
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,151
Simplicity whiskey

265
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
And Steve said oh no we did

266
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
That you don't need that

267
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,783
Everything you need to be on your desk

268
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
Is a personal computer is

269
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
Is all you need

270
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
At the root of apples

271
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,023
Success lies the world's first personal computer

272
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,631
The Apple II

273
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,935
Small inexpensive simple-to-use

274
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,519
The first computer and individual could take out of the box

275
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Plug-in

276
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Dandruff

277
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,783
Bringing Computing down to a personal level

278
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
One person

279
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
One computer

280
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
That was paid from the 1980s

281
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
Free promotional video for Apple

282
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
Here's jobs in South

283
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,607
Talking about missing the importance of network

284
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,959
When it was first demonstrated to him at Xerox Parc in 1979

285
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,543
100 Alto computers all network using email

286
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,103
Excetera excetera I didn't even see that

287
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
I was so blinded by

288
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,735
The first thing they showed me which was the graphical user interface

289
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,063
I thought it was the best thing I've ever seen in my life

290
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,927
Of course jobs eventually came around to networking but I take Christina engelbart's point

291
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,023
Are the designer being married to some pussy

292
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,351
We might also be limited by Simplicity as user

293
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,263
Example my dad used to like to go and I think this was really appropriate is the difference between a tricycle in a vice

294
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
So

295
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
Anybody can get on a tricycle

296
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
Especially if you see somebody else ride it

297
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
You know

298
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
You can just get on and ride it

299
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
You don't need any

300
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Training

301
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Do it and figure it out

302
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,135
But that's fine if you're just going to

303
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Go around the block

304
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
A couple of times

305
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,303
You trying to go up a hill a tricycle is a pretty bad way to go

306
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,095
You want to bike with gears

307
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:33,215
Can you learn how to balance tear in chain gears because it gives you a lot more power

308
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,519
You can cover a lot more steep ground

309
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
A lot of people

310
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
I made the point that

311
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,431
My dumbing-down computer is so much that is easy for anybody to learn

312
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
We made it so that

313
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Most people don't

314
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
Go to the trouble of learning something that

315
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
Could

316
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Give them more

317
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Leverage

318
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
More power with their computer

319
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,975
And I think that's a fair criticism

320
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
That's Larry tesler again

321
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,351
He agrees that early on Steve Jobs Overlook Network

322
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,167
They also thinks that jobs was right

323
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
To push person

324
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
If

325
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,775
You make it as we did an apple

326
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
So that

327
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
Just about anybody

328
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Can do

329
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:14,687
Things that they do everyday on on a computer or on a smartphone

330
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
Then

331
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
You giving them the only opportunity

332
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
But they're probably ever have

333
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
2

334
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
Benefit from

335
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
That power

336
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,207
Doug engelbart might look at the world now and say they're all on tricycle

337
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
Spaceship Beyond bicycle

338
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Nothing is

339
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,583
Are tricycles have gotten pretty awesome

340
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
They become so powerful and so well-designed that were actually able to get around without ever learning how to ballet

341
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,031
Balance on two wheels or shift gears

342
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
Maybe that's the world we're living in today

343
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
When were a lot of engelbart's ideas

344
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,479
Come to fruition and almost anyone can access

345
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
Including you

346
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,807
Your mom and Grandad and yes

347
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
Pretty soon

348
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
You're drooling iPhone poking toddler

349
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,231
But I think Christina would say there's still more we could learn

350
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,047
And a simple interfaces have sort of hidden that path

351
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
Is hung a curtain over the complex

352
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
It's tough to keep us from having to face

353
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,727
And in doing so they keep a stranded in Grand and

354
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Appointment

355
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,567
My dad always said for sure easy to learn easy to use

356
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
Fine for the beginner

357
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:22,271
Once you do something for a year or two or five why would you sit down and use the computer the same

358
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,319
What year did the very first day UK

359
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
Okay man that's

360
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,927
You need to have a clear stream lionpath

361
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:33,023
For advancing into a much more sophisticated

362
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
Holistic way of interacting

363
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
With a computer

364
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,447
Maybe the question is what kind of users do we want to be

365
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:45,055
The best design may not always be the one that's user-friendly at first sight

366
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,943
It might be the one that allows is the degree of virtuosity if we think investing the time is worth it

367
