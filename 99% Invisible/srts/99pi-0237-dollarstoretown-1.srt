Christmas decorations or old wooden toys

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,880
And soon a market opened up in the city of Iwo to sell

93
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,256

00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,567
And he really came to the city just to have an adventure and teach English

About the same time how to do the business hell

And most of these little toys and trinkets are being produced in small operation

176
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,535
Maybe a family has been able to buy one piece of industrial equipment and hire a few work

177
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:40,191
There's a scene in Daniels film where some migrant workers are sitting around in someone's garage making cheap costumes

178
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959

185
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,367
And take it to a different part of town where someone will put it in the packaging

186
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,463
And then the next I will come back and pick all that up and take it to the market

187
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,815
And for many people in The Province this isn't even there full-time day job

188
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
This is just a side business

189
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Everyone

190
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
From the age of sort of

191
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,263
22 to 80 and 90

192
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,871
They'll work in the farm and then I'll come back at night and stop making witches brooms

193
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,967
A bit like the cottage industry back in Industrial Revolution in England

194
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
Mets Nigel crop again

195
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,551
The British Trader who lives in emu

196
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,391
Great Britain 200

197
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
20:30 is

198
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,767
And you can see the effects of this super fast growth any Wu

199
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,631
The city grew so quickly and it still hasn't had time to build basic infrastructure

200
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:47,519
You say Senpai neighborhoods with without roads with no paved roads because they just

201
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
Need people

202
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
Immediately move into the building

203
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
And and start making stuff in the basement

204
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,623
What do you use after moving a tuna Nigel met his wife

205
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
An evil look

206
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,767
Who started the trading company she had a booth in the mall

207
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
I do so she was she was one of my students

208
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:21,567
Jesse's family is one of many anyway to benefit from China's turn toward a free market economy

209
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
Joshua

210
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Upstairs

211
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
Play something

212
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Play Coldplay

213
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,039
Always felt Poppy Family

214
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,647
Now that I felt I needed

215
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
Nigel's wife's great-grandparents

216
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,119
Prince can remember Iwo before it opened itself up

217
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Capitalism

218
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
What was that

219
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,519
Did we lift your since we were born

220
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
We built our own house

221
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,615
In the old days it was suffering

222
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
It was a really terrible

223
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,199
But tonight was great grandmother in law

224
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,759
Gong Jin Shan

225
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
Ruth Elisa

226
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,903
Just mentioning the suffering time I feel so sad I could cry

227
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Bahia colitis

228
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,231
Life was so tough

229
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,047
That a single sweet potato was divided into

230
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,095
Pieces for several meals

231
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,935
In the old days there were no cars

232
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Now

233
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,263
A lot of people can afford luxurious sedan

234
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Google

235
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,407
Taina I'm so comforted by the chain

236
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,783
Of course capitalism has also taken its toll on China

237
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,087
I think globalization

238
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Is

239
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Ruinous

240
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Unchecked

241
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
Like it is in places like

242
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,535
UC landscape almost completely

243
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Destroyed

244
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,399
United live the mountains are all the dog out is people burning

245
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
Rubbish everywhere

246
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
It's muggy all the time and you said it like

247
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
For what

248
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
And then you say why

249
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
It's people who

250
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:06,015
Spent years almost completely malnourished now being able to sit around with a giant

251
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
Family

252
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
I know 8 and have a lovely time

253
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,439
But now people in China who have been able to move out of desperate poverty

254
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,743
What more than to just make a living

255
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
And those people

256
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
A demanding about a lobster

257
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
Make a make

258
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
We are at the market everyday everyday

259
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,311
Everyday it never changes

260
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,615
That's one shot young again

261
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:37,503
Her business selling Santa's has grown substantially since our father first started it in 1992

262
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,063
It's allowed her family to move into the middle class

263
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,623
But it's also swallowing up her existence

264
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
She's there 7 days a week

265
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
From sunup to sundown

266
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:53,887
Cuz maybe everyone has some regret in their lives

267
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
If I got to do it again I would study harder

268
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,847
Then I would not have to rely on the business that my parents ran for my entire life

269
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,479
Like a lot of middle-class Chinese people want something more

270
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,855
My dream is to travel all around the world

271
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
The first place I want to go is Egypt

272
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,511
This is the place I wanted to go ever since I was a kid

273
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,047
She doesn't want to just

274
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:27,935
So santistevan dies awake until she's able to get his daughter to do the same thing

275
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
And then continue on forever

276
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,055
For now though one chaoyang just has to work harder

277
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,359
Because cost in China are going up

278
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,407
Enter profit margin is getting slimmer

279
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,223
Lehi momentum

280
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
Oren's Hummus

281
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
Sanya

282
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,111
Our cost for workers in China is increasing yearly

283
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
Every part of production

284
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,975
Starting from the smallest fitting part

285
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
2 assembly cost

286
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
It's getting more and more expensive

287
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,423
Has the cost of Labor goes up people seek out cheaper labor market

288
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
Bangladesh Vietnam

289
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
Laos

290
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
There right there

291
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,591
And that got the facilities to do it

292
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
And

293
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,199
They ready to take that work and I have time to type that work wife from

294
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
M-paisa sake with

295
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,623
The Chinese government is also interested in moving the country away from its reputation as the world's Factory

296
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
I don't want to be

297
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:26,815
I'm wet without all of that junk comes from they want to be the next South Korea or Taiwan or Japan.

298
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
Computers and Kaizen

299
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
And dumb

300
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,215
Are solar panels and things like that

301
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,543
Buty Wu is the city that cheap junk built

302
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
We're really only half belt

303
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,431
City grew so fast that basic infrastructure has not caught up to the growth

304
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:47,551
In the coming years the people of Iwo will have to find ways to finish building their City

305
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
And then new ways

306
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Is to survive

307
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
As the global economy changes

308
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:58,815
The world's dollar stores will continue to be full of plastic Santas and cheap trinkets of all kinds

309
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,679
But soon is stuff maybe made in the basements and garages and factories

310
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
Some others

311
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:18,527

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
And Tobias Anderson Auto Plaza

315
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,703
The whole film is about an hour long and puts a bunch of other really interesting characters that we couldn't fit into this radio piece you really should see it

316
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727

00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,383

Words to song

323
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,743
Definitely they only come in Justin Bieber

324
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,215

The album is called Low Gravity

327
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Look for it

328
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
And buy it

329
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:26,367

Oakland California

333
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
Between the beats

334
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
Bongs and chatter of our devices

335
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,519
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

336
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
If

337
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,943
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

338
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,039
All hearing. Voice

339
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,831
Technology talk to us

340
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
It is a creation of Sonic trash

341
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,951
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

342
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,535
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

343
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,583
To make them more human

344
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,423
Turn the living room lights on

345
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Okay

346
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
Dim the living room lights to 50

347
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
80%

348
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Okay

349
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:24,223
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

350
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,039
Makes for a much more natural experience

351
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
Turn the living room lights on

352
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,183
Dim the living room lights to 50%

Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

362
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:10,047
Frustrating it doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again
