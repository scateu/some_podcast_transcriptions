I'm Roman Mars

29
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,472
US Paper currency is so ubiquitous

30
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,776
That to really look at its graphic design with

31
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
Crash on

32
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616

A micropipette

39
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
Dreadful

40
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,304
Thermapure design of point of view

41
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:17,216
I thought I said that top because it is a little bit subjective but it's horrible

42
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
Topographically graphically symbolically if it never been designed before on someone was to submit that as a

43
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:28,224
The solution I think they were just going to throw it out and I don't want to get too critical at this point because

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
There are actually

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,112
Pretty compelling and understandable reasons for its particular brand of horribleness

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,256
Cracking the primary tension embodied in the design of the Greenback boils down to how my friend Tom Nelson at the

47
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,792
The blog humans and design for

48
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,864
When I handle American money it feels like an artifact

49
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,728
Because it's so ornate and it has an old look to it even though paper currency itself

50
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,032
The idea of money is a massive

51
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,080
World changing technology

52
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,896
The look and feel of us paper money

53
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,176
Is Barry stagner

54
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
It seems like a relic

55
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
When our country was founded would you buy a car

56
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,856
Food still look like the Model T Ford now you buy

57
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
The latest

58
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
Model all the things evolve

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,280
Two-time that's Richard Smith he run the contest called the dollar redesign fraud

60
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,584
It's become a classic like class

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
Suffix do

62
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
3 time

63
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,704
I'm sure usage and 3 familiarity sorry

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,752
Stole Christmas from a design point of view

65
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Kind of been

66
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
Superseded by

67
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Symbolic

68
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,296
So if you were to start from scratch when we design on US Paper Money

69
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
Smith says there are five major areas where we could improve

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
Number one is come

71
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,656
The idea of using one color doesn't really tell you much other than that we like the color green are largely monochromatic money

72
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Apples

73
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,008
We've introduced a purple 5 and some PT use

74
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,848
But there are a lot of colors and most countries use at least some of them

75
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Number to his size

76
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,456
Why the American currency old one-size-fits-all ways

77
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
Question mark in my head

78
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,320
Never really make sense practically

79
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,416
I'm philosophically having variable size coin certainly helps

80
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,232
The sort them and you could use the same principle for bills

81
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,303
Which leads us to point number three in Smith's manifest

82
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Functionality

83
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,935
Some functionality button Abel's people if they count C2

84
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
Clearly

85
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Distinguish

86
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
Waterbury to the fundamental level

87
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
Which note is which

88
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:34,687
The fact that there's no easy way for the blind to use our currency goes beyond bad design is actually immoral

89
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:41,087
Then the next fundamental thing I saw it was composition s number 4 meaning like what's it made from this is a

90
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
Is a little set of

91
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,207
Conceptual into like where this could go but be nice

92
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,279
Just seems that a product design I could come in and do the come out

93
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,167
Something really interesting recycled material with a smaller carbon footprint or more durable synthetics that last longer

94
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,007
And at the very heart of the dollar redesign project is number 5

95
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Symbolism

96
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
Who should go on the bills in

97
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Why

98
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
Why the founding fathers

99
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
The be-all-and-end-all of everything but is America

100
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,991
I think somebody that's the

101
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,063
One of the biggest issues if he went to change anything

102
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,367
I would say that was that would be where I would stop

103
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
It could be

104
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,439
Platform to celebrate everything that is

105
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,999
Unique special different

106
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
But you didn't know about America

107
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:27,423
And that's the suggestion that can get a British expat on his way to American citizenship like Richard Smith

108
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
Colorful hate mail

109
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,775
But it's an intriguing less than the last

110
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,871
Even if you just view the five suggestions as a philosophical exercise

111
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,455
To assess the current design for all of its strengths and faults

112
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,551
It's hard to imagine all those things being modified on US currency

113
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,135
But it's not hard to imagine each of them being implemented somewhere

114
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,695
In fact most of them are implemented everywhere

115
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Case in point

116
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Australia

117
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,839
On the other side of the world each and every one of these five issues

118
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
Coincidentally

119
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
Benadryl

120
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
Let me introduce

121
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Is a Mastiff

122
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Australian design

123
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Australia's new

124
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
$5

125
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,199
I'm really proud about money

126
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,039
Absolutely no idea why I'm so proud of it but I really am

127
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
That's Tristan cook

128
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,879
You're about to hear why you so proud

129
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,207
Tristan and Tom Nelson NPR from the top the show

130
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,791
Are user centred designers the neighbor on the Block I'm a big fan of

131
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
Call humans and Design

132
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,143
Tristan is Australian Tom is American

133
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,703
What time went to school in Australia for a couple years

134
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,495
And the money they're made of

135
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
Big impression on

136
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,079
The money is plastic

137
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,407
And they're all different sizes and their colorful

138
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,455
At first these changes were disconcerting

139
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,855
I'll just look like toy money to me in this will shock you begin to appreciate all the different design characteristics

140
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
Australian currency

141
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
First

142
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Is the color

143
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,511
$5 is sort of a lavender $10 is

144
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,583
Blue with little bit of a green stripe in it 20

145
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,447
You can tell the differences between things you generally is

146
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,031
Stock quote

147
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
And you code

148
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
Things like styes

149
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
Feel

150
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
And color

151
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
So in Australian money we have Al

152
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,111
Primarily by color

153
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,439
In some ways is a better index because it doesn't require knowledge of

154
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
Who's on the bill it only requires

155
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,047
Recognition of a color association with

156
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
The pineapple World Lobster

157
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
Very common just yet but we cool at night

158
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,263
SoundClick colors and my tooth personal favorite cycling a $20 night which is

159
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,823
Orange-colored killing a lobster

160
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
And cooling a $50 note

161
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Which is

162
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,711
Green and yellow color and Cooling in a pint

163
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
Which is short for pineapple

164
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:56,159
It's all about the pineys number to size

165
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,559
Feel different in your hand sometimes I cash in my pocket I can tell the difference between a $5

166
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,959
Tonight tonight because Eli would say this about a centimeter difference between each denomination

167
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,031
Between a 5 and a 10 is in that big

168
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,847
But between a 5 and a 50 is

169
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Very big

170
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
4 centimeters difference

171
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,783
Both number one and two relate to the third issue raised by Richard Smith

172
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,367
And that's functionality you can see whether you got

173
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
A5 A10

174
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,255
A 20 or 50 from the top of your wallet because of the color and size difference

175
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
Number for

176
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
Composition of plastic notes were developed primarily to combat counterfeiting

177
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,383
If you dropped a note on the floor Men's Room you don't really feel bad about

178
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,455
Picking it up and putting it under the faucet before you put it back in your pocket

179
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,343
But they last longer they tend to last four times longer than fibrous

180
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Take a note

181
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
20 years old and I

182
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Pretty much

183
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,231
Just looked at 9

184
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,095
What Australia chooses to put on its currency is more in keeping with what rich

185
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,911
Smith of the dollar redesign project would like to see

186
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
It's much more inclusive than

187
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
Founding fathers

188
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Monuments

189
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,567
But it's hard to tell if these symbols are conveyed much a penny

190
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Everyday

191
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Australian

192
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
They don't put

193
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,711
Statesman on on money frequently there are artists

194
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
Poets

195
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
And

196
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
I think

197
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,343
Are there some Aboriginal leaders

198
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,415
If there's another thing till you couldn't awful prime minister's on

199
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
Oh no money

200
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,535
We don't have the reference to a promises in Australia

201
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,071
Couldn't name the people that

202
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:43,167
Are on their money

203
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:48,031
Except for one side of the $5 is the queen and it's just because I don't want her on there

204
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,895
Imagine if you ask any Australian if they know who is only noise

205
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:59,551
EBay would be less than 1% of people who did nine anybody other than Queen symbolism in Australian cash seems to be

206
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
Betide Morty

207
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,623
The innovation of the build themselves

208
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
Is a certain Pride

209
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,719
The Palmer bills were developed in Australia

210
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
And I've been exported to the rest of the world

211
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,119
Australia now manufactures the polymer notes of nearly 20 other country

212
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
The good design of the currency itself

213
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
Is the overriding brand

214
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,543
It's no ordinary night however

215
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,847
It's Australia Snoop on a $10

216
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,919
And was developed and printed right here I would like to

217
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
American currency

218
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Redesign

219
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
Treated more like a live

220
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
Piece of technology

221
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,343
Rather than rocks

222
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
I think

223
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
Even the most jingoistic among us

224
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Best could come

225
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,743
See that there are design innovation

226
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,863
Could be incorporated into US currency to make it better but there are some interesting reasons why we

227
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Probably won't

228
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
You know someone once told me that

229
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
Getting rid of the Greenback would be like

230
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
Burning the flag

231
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:56,383
Steps of the Capitol is the end of mine

232
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,735
A lot of people are currently it's a physical touchdown of our national identity

233
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
Some of this is emotional

234
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
But there is this

235
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
Other concern that is

236
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,207
Simultaneously analyzing and scary

237
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,327
And that other concern is that when you redesign the money you are mine people what currency is

238
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
And what gives the currency value

239
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,935
And of course what gives the currency value

240
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Is our belief

241
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
That it's value

242
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,543
In in a religious sense of

243
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
Nothing more than faith

244
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,871
Are TriStar worship whatever you want to call it

245
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
Makes a dollar

246
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,479
Warsaw dollar or worth whatever you're going to buy with it

247
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
So

248
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,575
That is upsetting to a lot of people and

249
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,135
To maintain the

250
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,207
Aura of strength and stability of the United States

251
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
Economy

252
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
It probably helps to maintain these leggings

253
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Features in the design of our money

254
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
What is now

255
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,935
Three or four generations we had the same color I think since

256
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
War

257
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Portrait

258
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
Steam crave styling the filigree

259
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
Legacy fit

260
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
Teachers convey stability

261
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,175
An hour currency the currency on which all other currencies are hedge

262
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Has to be stable

263
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,015
So not only do we not redesign the stuff

264
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
But we don't

265
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
Pull older notes from circulation either

266
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
So we'll have

267
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
Reissues and redesign

268
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
AmeriCash

269
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
But you can still use

270
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
The last generation

271
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Design

272
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
As legal tender

273
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,983
In other countries a complete redesign deprecates the old design

274
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,335
You're giving a Grace. To use or exchange it but after a certain date the old currency

275
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
Shredded by the central bank

276
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
And you can no longer

277
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,943
Spend any that you have left

278
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
This is never been the case in the US

279
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,063
You can even use it an 18 century coin

280
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,671
Stamped with just the value of $0.02 to go buy something you might want to be careful because I can be

281
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
So stupid

282
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
It could be worse

283
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,047
You know $3,000 to a collector out there

284
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,607
But if you want to go spend it as $0.02

285
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
You can

286
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
And again that this is part of

287
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
Creating is Aura of

288
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,519
Super stability and inherent value

289
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
Federal Reserve notes

290
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,639
David woman is quick to point out that even though these concerns events

291
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Stability have

292
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,503
Incited when people bring up redesigning the money or eliminating the penny

293
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
He thinks it's

294
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
Pretty Arash

295
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
Hainan overly cautious

296
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
It seems to me a little bit patronizing to think that Americans couldn't handle a dollar redesign really who is going

297
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
Going to push it forward

298
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
You know if you're going to go to work in government

299
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,863
Don't you almost by definition have

300
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
Some of that sense of

301
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:32,031
Patriotism and nationalism that would make you a little bit more inclined to like

302
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,079
Greenback as is

303
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
And a little less inclined to

304
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
You let some

305
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Really

306
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
Let's get after it

307
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,927
But still primarily driven by anti-counterfeiting measures

308
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,511
US currency has been pushed to change in recent years

309
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,095
And most of these new designs are why it looks worse than

310
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Ever

311
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,447
Legacy features remain largely intact but a layer

312
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
Modern fonts

313
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Swirlds

314
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
Text the bills look like they're busting at

315
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Seems is the worst

316
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
Both world

317
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,199
It's absolute chaos there is very little Italian

318
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
About

319
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,295
Are money from a blind stamp on as far as I enter

320
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,855
When I told David woman about my new-found

321
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Discovery Inn

322
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Appreciation of the US

323
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,719
Australian dollar as evangelize by Tristan and Tom

324
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
He was less

325
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:30,399
I don't I don't think it's that remarkable congratulations to the Aziz and the scientist who came up with

326
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
Polymer banknotes

327
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
And I think they

328
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,031
Well because of that innovation

329
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
But I'm just not convinced

330
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Very welcome

331
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
Pretty

332
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
Hey I personally think pretty counts

333
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,783
But from his point of view a better design banknote even a plastic one is

334
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Still

335
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Just a piece

336
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
Paper

337
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,647
I mean his book is called the end of money

338
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:56,767
That design efforts out there related to money that excite me more

339
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Argue design

340
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,143
Are the user interface of apps for mobile money

341
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,751
Right how are we going to be transacting with money in PayPal mobile and Google Wallet and

342
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
What are designers bringing to bear on those interface

343
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
Paper or polymer money

344
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
I get it all right

345
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,783
Truly interesting Frontier of design is not going to be

346
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
The banknote

347
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Art

348
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
But the Swiss come up with it

349
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
16

350
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
It's going to be

351
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
The interface

352
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
With

353
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,559
Mobile apps and what designers are doing

354
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
To make

355
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Our interactions

356
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
With money

357
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
Fluid

358
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,031
More sophisticated and possibly God forbid even like wiser

359
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
Who's presenting the app

360
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,127
To make us a little more careful with our money

361
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
And how are they

362
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,479
Bringing to the Arizona principles of design to make that happen

363
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,087
And this is something that Tristan and Tom are totally on board with

364
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,463
Physical money is probably on its way out and polymer money as cool as it is

365
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
Is it technology

366
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
David Stein

367
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,423
They themselves have actually designed clever user interfaces so that the good aspects of physical money already
