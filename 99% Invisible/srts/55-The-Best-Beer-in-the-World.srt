Belgians take their beer very seriously

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,384
They're about 200 breweries in a country about twice the size of the Bay Area

Now I'm a person just like you but don't actually drink beer to off takes roses word for it

51
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,896
Or the word of one of the many beer reviewers on YouTube

00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,480
Tuesday looks amazing

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
Titanic about it

54
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
So many flavors

55
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,304
Yes and I think we all know what you're going to get

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
That's something else

57
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,632
That sucks

58
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
My tongue is tingling

59
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
Yeah it's it's

60
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
If we need to know about Trappist beer

61
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
First they're amazing

62
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Second

63
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
They're made by Trappist monks

64
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,936
These monks Trace their roots to a monastery in 17th century France

65
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
And have since spread out to

66
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,752
To all over the world

67
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,616
The main concept behind the Trap as lifestyle is at the Abbey should be economically self-sufficient

68
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
In other words

69
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
The monk should make

70
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,272
And sell it to the public as a way to fund the operations of the Abbey itself

71
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
So make cheese

72
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
So make spirits

73
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
There's even one in Germany

74
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
That makes lentil soup

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
But none of the Trap is products

76
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
Are nearly anywhere as famous as the beer

77
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
Only seven beer-making Trappist Abbey

78
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Exist

79
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
Sixer in Belgium

80
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,471
And one is in the Netherlands Ben was widely available Trappist beer is Chimay

81
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,311
You can get it in a lot of us specialty grocery stores and some bars to

82
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,127
They make over 3 million gallons of the stuff a year

83
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,735
By comparison West waiter and makes less than 4% of that volume annually

84
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:42,879
But westvleteren with its plain brown bottle No Label in the only writing is on the cap at super cool

85
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
It's one of the rarest and many say

86
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
It's the best beer in the world

87
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,911
But here's the thing about Westway torrent you can't go there and have as much beer as you want you can't even have it shipped from the app

88
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,471
You want to buy beer to take a with you

You're not the only one

100

Dudoir small-scale production

102
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
The number of

103
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Phone calls is much greater

104
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
The number of available

As well as

109
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,383
And here's what you need to understand about me I have

110
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,247
Totally game for this I love being challenged as a food consumer

111
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:46,879
If there's a burger place in Connecticut that claims to have invented the hamburger in America

112
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,463
And you don't true to their century-old rules they refuse

113
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
To serve burgers

114
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
With ketchup or mustard

115
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
And the only serve it on toast

116
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
I love that

117
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:02,239
I mean if they told me that I had to do 50 Jumping Jacks and run around the block and then I could get a burger I would totally do

118
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,287
At 2

119
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
Back twist sweater

120
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895

00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Sunday

123
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,039
Lucky enough to talk to a monk

124
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,831
And yes you do talk to him

125
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
To take your reservation

126
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,463
You have to give your license plate number and be available to come pick up your crate

127
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
During the appointed time that weekend

128
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,303
You're limited to one crate

129
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
Per person per car

130
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
Maximum

131
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Supercar

132
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,983
And you can't buy more than one crate during a 60-day period

133
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,079
Oh and you agree not to resell the beer as well

134
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,639
For information PCC over website

135
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
You got that

136
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,087
There's a list of several seemingly arbitrary Hoops they have to jump through if you want to buy this beer

137
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
This sort of thing is not unheard of

138
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
Velvet ropes and random reward

139
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,231
Has long been imposed to create art of

140
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279
Scarcity in the heightened demand

141
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,655
But the mainstream print today seems to be more geared towards greater access and accommodation for customer

142
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,775
The new ideal is that everything is available at all times no matter where you live

143
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,847
This is the digital age but clearly

144
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,663
This is not the case for the West waiter and Travis

145
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,479
They're trying to make it as difficult as boss

146
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
No no no no no no

147
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
They don't make a diff

148
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
You make it difficult

149
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
Tula

150
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
Too much people want

151
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
This beer

152
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
This is Jeff vondenstein

153
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
He's the author of a book called

154
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Trappist

155
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
The seven Heavenly beers

156
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
He's even a brewer himself

157
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
Until 10 years ago

158
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,679
You could go to the NBA

159
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
Except on Sunday

160
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
Goes down they don't work

161
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,335
And accept on Friday because Friday they don't work

162
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Because they don't eat

163
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Friday

164
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
But Saturday with David open

165
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
You went there

166
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Without problems

167
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
You could buy

168
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
Beer nuts

169
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
As much as you want

170
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
But normally

171
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,743
Three grades of two grades

172
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Always pads

173
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
But then

174
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
The Americans

175
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
It's all your fault

176
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,959
I'm sorry I know is it the Americans

177
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
Set

178
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
What's playing today

179
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
The best beer of the world

180
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,615
That because English is World Language

181
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,687
No don't lie in in the in the US England

182
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
But also

183
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
Scandinavian countries

184
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Go everywhere

185
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
Where they speak

186
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
Or understand English

187
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
Dickens read BeerAdvocate

188
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
Website

189
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
And suddenly

190
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,047
Did the moms of this beer was 10 times bigger

191
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
That's the problem

192
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
It's not their problem they Bruno

193
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,191
The same amount as they did before

194
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,799
Keep in mind this was basically the first thing that Jeff said to me when I sat down with him

195
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
I sort of felt

196
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
Guilty to be honest because

197
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
He was right

198
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
I heard about this beer for years

199
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,551
And now that I was living within Striking Distance just over the Border in Germany

200
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,111
There was no way I was going to pass it up

201
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
Just an older guy with a full

202
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,535
Bushy grey beard and he seems to know just about everything about beer

203
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
And having written about the Trappist monks

204
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,423
He was the closest that I was going to get to an actual Monk

205
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,239
But Jeff is sort of Trappist monk by proxy

206
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,079
Outline the main reason for putting up these obstacles to get in Westwood

207
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
They decided

208
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
Hebrew the same amount

209
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
As the Lost

210
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
The years

211
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
And they have enough for that

212
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Why

213
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Miss Deborah Moore

214
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Cuz you won't

215
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
No

216
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
And I

217
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
They live between

218
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
The Wolves of

219
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
Rabbit

220
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
The problem

221
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:45,983
So with that in mind and after spending about 90 minutes at Jax Brewery deglazer Turin

222
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
And of course we bought some bottles

223
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
My three friends and I headed out

224
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
To visit the famed monks

225
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Of Westlake

226
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,479
Now as we mentioned earlier you have to order ahead if you want to buy queso

227
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,807
Cerise didn't have any luck ordering crates

228
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,623
But he knew he could at least sample some when he got there

229
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,207
I realized as soon as my friends and I got to The Abbey

230
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Is it

231
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
Jeff was totally right

232
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
The Abbey

233
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Is in the middle of nowhere

234
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Surrounded by

235
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
Small houses

236
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
And it's way out in the western edge

237
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
Belgium very close to the French border

238
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
Totally understandable why the monks

239
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
Decided to Institute

240
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
This new ordering system

241
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Hundreds of cars descended on these

242
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,711
Tiny roads all of a sudden

243
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
It would be disaster

244
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
In other words

245
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,343
Designing this whole process to make access difficult

246
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
Calling the vehicle Reg

247
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
Restriction all of it

248
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
A lot of it comes down to Rhodes

249
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Infrastructure

250
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,815
Is there ways to solve the problem one is bigger Road

251
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
They can also choose to

252
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,447
Skip the beer out to distributor and have no one visit The Abbey at all

253
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
There are solutions

254
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
But it's clearly not a problem the monks

255
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
Want to song

256
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,407
I did finally get to sit down and have a beer at the cafe across the

257
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:02,783
Until this year with the only place that was allowed to resell it although there's been a thriving

258
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
Blackish gray Market

259
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
Quite some time

260
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,415
I wish I could say that the experience was heavenly

261
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,999
Don't get me wrong this beer really is fantastic

262
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,583
It's not a complex flavor in an obviously crafted with a

263
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
How to pair thoughtfulness

264
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
The flipside of having a label

265
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,519
I'm having this mythology that brings people from around the world like me

266
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,079
To this Monastery is that the relationship but

267
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
Between customer

268
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
And Brewery

269
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,663
Feels almost anonymous

270
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
Generic

271
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,759
It's like my friends and I could have just bought this beer off eBay

272
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
And enjoyed it almost anywhere

273
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,111
It would have been basically the same experience

274
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Just a lot more expensive

275
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,255
And this is a symptom of the exact same Credo that makes the beer rare and exclusive

276
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:49,887
Clearly the West waiter and Travis take pride in creating something great that people enjoy

277
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,959
But you the consumers of beer

278
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Arnott

279
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
The real customer

280
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
God is

281
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,615
The head of the Abbey says on their website

282
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
We are not

283
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Brewers

284
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
We are monks

285
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,271
We broke up here to be able to afford being monks

286
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,599
This beer is not about you and me

287
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:16,255
They're not creating a purist mystique and challenging us to come to the monastery and experience their beer in

288
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:22,143
I am totally ready to capitulate to the monks just like that Connecticut hamburger place

289
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
I will do

290
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
Whatever they want me to do

291
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
I want them to know that I am on board

292
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
Did I speak their language

293
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,151
But it turns out they're not even talking to me

294
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,343
As we mentioned earlier The Limited supply of us later and had created a pricey Black Market

295
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879

307

335

The body genius is a dark

Comic mystery

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

341
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,031
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

342
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,383
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

344
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,087
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

345
