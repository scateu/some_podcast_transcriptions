This is 99% invisible

27
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm Roman Mars

28
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,240
When the Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886

29
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,056
It was a dull copper color

30
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,872
Statue is covered with a layer of

31
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,688
A copper metal about the thickness of two pennies

32
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,600
But after about 1900 the physical processes that govern the known universe began to take their toll

33
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,952
And the copper skin oxidized into a greenish patina

34
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,512
They can be seen on the Statue to this day

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,120
When the statue underwent a massive Restoration in the 1980s

36
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,424
Be Head and Shoulder where we line

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,544
The point on the crown that have been digging into her arm for a century was shortened

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,872
The defects in the internal skeleton were thoroughly addressed

39
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
And of course

40
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,456
The weather beaten exterior was cleaned

41
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
But there was no notion that the statues skin should be returned to the dull copper color

42
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
She was born when

43
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,744
But if they had signed up Lady Liberty to her original copper color

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
The people of New York City

45
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,328
Probably would have reacted

46
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
Like this

47
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
I don't like looking at

48
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:21,056
This is not someone from New York as you can probably guess that's Barbara Clark five generations of her family have lived in store

49
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Stirling Scotland

00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
Manning spotrac Clark

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,688
And I've lived in Sterling on my life

52
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,992
Apart from when I was at University

53
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,064
Sterling is also the home of Stirling Castle

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,160
Truly marvelous place they just love to visit that sits atop a giant

55
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
Craig

57
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
Overlooking the whole town of Sterling

58
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,656
Some Council has been there since the 12th century and maybe before but the current buildings date from the 15th and 16th century

59
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:52,800
Well obviously it's part of our Lives to see every single day in his children with Khalid in it

60
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
Banana

61
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,432
When we think of medieval castles we usually picture a grand structure

62
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
Subdued dark

63
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
Stone Mason

64
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,064
But when you gaze upon Starling Castle today

65
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
The down below

66
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,904
You will notice that one of the buildings is different

67
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
From the others

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
Since 1999

69
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
Dromon restoration effort

70
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
The Great Hall of Stirling Castle

71
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Has been

72
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
Bright

73
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Yellow

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
Best bright yellow building

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,264
You know was sticking out like a sore thumb

76
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
And people would just

77
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,384
Horrified after I can remember just thinking

78
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
This is a nightmare

79
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,624
The story of how the Great Hall of Stirling Castle came to be painted bright yellow illustrates the unexpected comes

80
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,928
Lexi in the art of restoration

81
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
It comes down to this question

82
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
When you choose to restore something

83
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
Which moment and time are you restoring it

84
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,680
Some kind of nameless group of people

85
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
Reach that decision

86
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Hyundai

87
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
Don't question the motives

88
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,128
My question that understanding us if

89
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Ficked

90
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
That it was going to have

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
On

92
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
People's feelings towards

93
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Mikasa

94
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
Who made that decision

95
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
Oh I know

96
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
It was a guy

97
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:16,256
My name is Peter becoming my work with the Snorks compliments my title noise project manager

98
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,607
I joined the start skeleton 1991 tour, starting up a project

99
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:26,751
Historic Scotland is the government organization charged with educating the public and safeguarding Scotland's historic Treasures

100
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:32,127
They took over the care of Stirling castle and started the Great Hall Restoration in 1991

101
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
First let's get some Castle facts

102
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:42,879
The castle of people have this fairytale Disneyland thing in their hands were it's all one huge building with

103
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,719
Most medieval castles were a collection of buildings for certain things

104
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,023
They have a chapel that a palace

105
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,375
They would have had kitchen the Great Hall is one of those key buildings in a castle

106
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,191
And quote Bill Bryson his book at home

107
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,799
No room has fallen further in history than the hall

108
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,871
Now a place to wipe feet and hang hats

109
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,455
Once it was the most important room in the house

110
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,343
It is a huge Gathering space the one here at Sterling was also for the parliament of Scotland

111
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,743
So the King was stopped here they would set Lowe's they would have Banquets and Feasts

112
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:25,119
David entertain lavishly Peter Buchanan adopted the Great Hall of Sterling

113
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
It was in an awful state

114
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,543
Stirling Council up until 1964 was a military Garrison

115
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:37,151
From 1800 to 1964 the castle was owned by the war office

116
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,759
And they did not treat the castle as a historic artifact to be preserved

117
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,831
Most of the buildings within the council were used by them

118
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:51,231
The great hole was used Park accommodation turning one big fancy room into Barracks meditating

119
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,815
Lord Altrincham Windows replacing the ceiling really changing everyday

120
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
What's a military left the place was got it

121
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:02,239
And when Peters team took over in 1991 the building with a shell

122
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,311
It still happened to reform it

123
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,407
But it was left with a huge question mark after what we should do with it

124
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:15,295
The typical Mandate of historic Scotland is to preserve historic places in the state they were found

125
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,135
The Great Hall of Stirling Castle required some drastic measures

126
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
So what state do you restore to

127
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,535
Do preference the military. From the 1800s or the medieval and Renaissance

128
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:32,703
Strategically the castle had been important for hundreds of years at rule

129
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
History of Scotland

130
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,055
Husband St toxins

131
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,383
Excluding earliest times the first recorded King

132
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,503
Castle Hill Overlook sebagh on one side and the bridge over the Fourth River on the other

133
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,623
2 / hundreds of years it was the place that control trade for the whole region

134
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
Mary Queen of Scots

135
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
It was seen

136
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
The cultural significance of these things art Wade

137
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
The significance of the military.

138
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:06,751
Using this logic they decided to restore the Great Hall to estate it was about three to four hundred years in the past

139
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,055
But that kind of restoration is not

140
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Simple

141
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
First of all the records aren't all that consistent

142
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
Have a series of etchings

143
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
What's great hole

144
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,015
Before seems like a whole show slightly different sayings

145
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,599
Traditional you have read the Beast heraldic beasts on the top

146
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
Grateful is our big stone statues of unicorns and lions that sit on the apex of the roof

147
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,815
Laurentian's show these but they show different numbers of them

148
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,399
The edge

149
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:39,263
Can I give a customer to look like a tool for restoration

150
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,663
They weren't much use to help figure out where the recipes should be placed on top of the building they had to figure out

151
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
The original structure of the roof

152
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,807
Sometime in the 20th century the roof had been completely replaced by the military

153
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
Original Hall had this glorious

154
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
Hammerbeam roof

155
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
Hammerbeam roof

156
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,463
Is a medieval technique

157
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
That uses

158
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:05,631
Wood beams as a network of cantilevers and trusses on the inside to make the roof strong

159
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Wide open room

160
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,775
You can see all the timber when you look up from inside the hall lights

161
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Stunning

162
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,591
It's a jigsaw puzzle of beautiful

163
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,895
Triangles that are amazing to behold

164
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Pringles

165
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,855
Because the ridge Beast Wade 3/4 of a ton they can only be placed where the hammer beam roof was the strongest

166
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,927
This is as true now as it was 300 years ago

167
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:35,327
We got, being rich constructing makeup know how everything works left we want to get it released but we need Clues to be over

168
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
They found one diagram of a cross-section of the hammer beam roof of the Great Hall from 17-19 but

169
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,567
Since it's the only record it's hard to know if it's completely accurate

170
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
Since there was no other information about what the roof look like they began researching the surveyors from 1790 New Jersey

171
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:57,087
The diagram and they found that other diagrams they drew of other castles were very accurate

172
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,647
So here's our leap of faith this is where

173
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
You start

174
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,231
How to use conjecture in your restoration

175
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
To make value judgments

176
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,839
And we've decided that we will put the whole of the structure back

177
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,143
So this is what we're basing it on

178
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
So using that one historic document they reconstructed the roof which determine where the heavy Stone Ridge Beast would be

179
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Placed on top

180
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,431
One Discovery begets another and another and the original building comes into Focus

181
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,831
And that's the detective work of restoration careful research Discovery verification sometimes conjecture

182
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
Leaps of faith

183
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,951
It's this beautiful amalgam of history science and art

184
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:39,327
The hammer beam roof was completed in 1999 and everyone who sees it including the Sterling Folk

185
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Singer Gray

186
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
It looks really great

187
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
So far

188
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
New controversy

189
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
But as We Know

190
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,287
The roof was not the only thing to change

191
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
So the controversy is coming

192
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:57,503
The building was almost completely gray stone that was none of the original

193
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,599
But in one corner just under the Best Buy

194
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,671
There had been a little lean to shelter

195
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
Built in front of the door

196
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,023
I want me to get my refund the complete panel

197
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
Of the original lime wash

198
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,679
Limewash is pure lime calcium oxide. The green citrus fruit

199
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,983
It also contains earth-based pigments

200
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,311
It's a coding that's meant to protect the stone masonry

201
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:26,175
Navigate to Sterling they found a significant yellow ochre layer of limewash

202
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,551
The bright yellow was very intentional hundreds of years ago that built world is basically Brown

203
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
There was this great

204
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,231
Yellow piece of ostentatious bling that signaled for miles

205
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
That this was a place

206
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
Burger King

207
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,631
And we did huge some puddles all the time which is around the building

208
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,727
To show people what open mics have look like avocados might have been

209
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,823
And we brought a lot of people from the starting area to see this as well

210
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
Guess what we were intending to do

211
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,919
Based on the analysis and information had

212
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
Was to put the finishes by

213
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,295
And that is exactly what they did which is why the Great Hall

214
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
Is yellow

215
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,415
Did not exactly go over well with the people of Sterling

216
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
Strangely in restoration terms

217
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,815
It's the one element that we had the most evidence for

218
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:19,935
They actually had physical pieces of exterior limewash all over the castle

219
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
The hammer beam roof on the other hand

220
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
Was based much more on conjecture

221
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
It's not working right

222
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,735
When Peters team was putting on the yellow finish the Great Hall was completely covered in Scaffolding in plastic

223
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:39,391
This may have contributed to the intensity of the reaction from the locals once it was unveiled.

224
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,439
Sterling resident Barbara Clark again

225
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,023
The entire hole was shorter than tarpaulin

226
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
18 years

227
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,983
Nuvoton usually what was going on when you the Battle of stonemasons up there

228
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
But nobody knew anything about anything else

229
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,359
So when the Great unveiling came

230
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,919
It was a total

231
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Surprise

232
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
It just

233
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Loot

234
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
So awful

235
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
And to this day I don't like

236
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
Pet

237
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,487
When I asked you to be Cannon what he would have done differently if you had to do it all over again he says

238
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,375
He would do all the same Restorations but he would have been more aggressive about Outreach we could have tried harder

239
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Wii setup

240
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,959
Couple weekend Stone in the center of starling

241
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
To explain what we were doing

242
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:32,895
Lots of groups around to see the samples before we went any further but really getting that message out at 3

243
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,223
To the media and getting people to understand that is very very difficult

244
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,295
Tell me when it is a change on the scale

245
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
I think that possibly

246
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,391
A bigger marketing campaign

247
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:50,047
Should have come up there this was 15 years ago before Twitter and Facebook made it easier to reach people certainly wood

248
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,887
Experience from the great hollow as to how I think we should be getting messages

249
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,215
If people really understand what you're doing and raylee

250
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,263
Buy internet from day one

251
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,823
Then I think it makes it alot easier

252
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
All Restorations are unique

253
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,039
I don't think the Statue of Liberty should have been returned to Copper when it was restored

254
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
As a landmark

255
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,159
People fell in love with it and it gained its significance when it was Green

256
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
It made sense to keep it that way

257
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:23,071
But I found being in the bright yellow Great Hall at Stirling Castle

258
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
Really exciting

259
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:30,239
I'm sympathetic to the fact that the color was shocking to the residents who grew up with it looking completely different

260
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,055
But it's brightness brought it to life for me

261
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:38,175
It made me reinterpret my faded and ultimately wrong image of the past

262
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:44,575
It's nearly all the Greek and Roman sculptures that we know and love were painted bright vibrant colors

263
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,111
Even though most of us

264
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
Can only imagine them as white marble

265
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,743
When I see color reconstructions of ancient statues

266
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
I think they look

267
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
Ridiculous

268
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:01,215
But I can't help but feel that I know the Greeks and Romans a little bit better after seeing what they thought look good

269
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,615
I feel the same about the Renaissance artist who designed the color schemes inside and outside Stirling Castle

270
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,687
They were mixing colors that ready not much

271
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
They were using them in extraordinary ways they were having great fun and showing an awful lot of wealth and power in the Press

272
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,463
But this is probably the first and last such restoration for historic Scotland

273
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,583
New scanning and 3D rendering technology means that you can quote on quote

274
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,655
Store a place and teach people would it look like

275
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
At any point in history

276
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,775
Inside the virtual world of a computer exhibit

277
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:40,127
Without doing anything drastic to the actual physical structure at all

278
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,687
Approach

279
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:47,295
We can do extraordinary things nicer technologies that we couldn't have done 15 years ago

280
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,183
It's a really really easy way to educate people to show them up things might have been like

281
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:59,583
With White Fang too heavy-handed to the monument remain as Unique Restoration

282
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
Miss North Dakota's history

283
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,679
Which totally makes sense

284
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,239
But every once in awhile

285
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,591
It's nice to be bold and daring like our ancestors were

286
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,151
A slap on that bright coat of paint

287
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
And see just how Vivid

288
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
The world

289
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
Are my friends

290
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
Helen and Martin work on the great podcast answer me this together which is one of my absolute favorites in phone

291
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,567
Tons of awards it's incredibly popular in the UK

292
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
And when we started radiotopia

293
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,175
I talked with Helen about the idea of her doing

294
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,503
A new show specifically for us on whatever she wanted

295
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,903
Helen is a language and etymology fanatic and she pitched us The Illusionist which I'm going to describe as

296
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,207
99percentinvisible forwards

297
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,815
Mainly so everyone who listens this show will understand that if you love 99percentinvisible

298
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
You'll love

299
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119

301
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,383
As a little summertime treat I thought I'd just play through the latest episode of The Illusionist

302
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
Welcome to The Illusionist

Coming up in the shower

307
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
Word games

308
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,559
To prepare yourself which has a game Word

309
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
Game as in the genre of meat

310
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,703
Is so-called because it was obtained through the game or sport of hunting

311
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,263
This is 3 Lux in venison

312
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,847
Which evolved from the Latin verb venari meaning

313
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
Tangerine mystery the old French venison

314
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:54,271
Wichmann the meat of a large game animal usually dead or wild boar

315
00:16:54,527 --> 00:17:00,671
Clues to why the animal is called a dick until the point at which is being eaten or appointed

316
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
The same with parents like

317
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,791
Pound beef and Pick-n-Pull finnsheep muffin

318
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:11,423
The words for the creatures in the living state to the Anglo-Saxon ones where is the meat was originated from French

319
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,983
Of the Norman invasion of Britain in Tennessee

320
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,799
66

321
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Chrissy was speaking French

322
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
Once you for the food we eat the meat

323
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,967
Korean writing

324
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,015
Say that you got me towards

325
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
On with the show

326
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
Brown's children

327
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,255
Grandma's go to story about how we have to make our own fun

328
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
A long boring Journeys

329
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
We had like

330
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:45,727
Or indeed any equipment to do a build vocabulary because who hasn't had to wall the way I was talking to call rauf

331
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
On the bus or train

332
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,543
Playing word games

333
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
That's fun

334
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,151
I spy why your listing boring things

335
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
All The Minister's cat

336
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
Listing adjectives

337
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,039
The number plate game where you have to name things

338
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
Start with the same letters as you

339
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
C on the number pi

340
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,647
The call you've been stuck behind in the Trap

341
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
John Parappa

342
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
Replacing words in songs with rude words

343
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
All the old family favorite

344
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,839
Guess how many words you can say before the drive in Shelton

345
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Just shut up

346
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
Do you have to sit in silence

347
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
The two hours

348
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,959
Bonus points if you go beyond 4

349
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
His money issue with these games

350
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,079
None of them actually much fun to play

351
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,151
Except for the replacing words in a song with regrets game

352
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431
Which stupid again

353
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,991
But really most of these well games

354
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
That was fun as filling in the spreadsheet

355
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,623
CityVille fill the function of obliterating adult consignment

356

Put the prize in winning the game

358
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
So you don't have

359
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
How to play the game

360
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887

Pictures

365
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
What are the elements

00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,199
Top Notch wood gay

367
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295

Has created more than 40 games

370
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
A lot of which a word

371
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
Such as anagrams where you can put on a ground

372
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Speed

373
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583

00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
But she's probably best nine

376
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
So no more game

377
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,055
The build a Paris tower out of wooden bricks game

378
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
Jenga

379
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
A game

380
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
Otherwise it will be cold enough

381
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
A different occupation

382
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831

Game that I know

387
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
But it still has an alibi

388
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Somebody leaves

389
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
Lucky winner

390
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
If you don't have that element to it

391
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,615
It's another another game in my opinion

392
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
We need to bring out people's the malevolence

393
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:09,599

00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Play the games

403
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:30,079
You just have to be a good liar which is found in an etymological

404
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,103
Because fun

00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871

Fun fun 2

410
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
For a little while anyway

411
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,647
Because another crucial factor for a good game according to Leslie

412
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
Is speed

413
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
I love Scrabble

414
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
Until about halfway through the game

415
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,583
And then it just slows down

416
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
The point where

417
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
You're waiting and waiting for people to

418
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:58,495
7 tiles around

419
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,311
I just got

420
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
Scrabble

421
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,663
But it's a variation of a game

422
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
70 people that love

423
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,503
Scrabble

424
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
Is that supposed no pressure

425
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
Me before you

426
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
Anagram

427
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
I would have said my favorite when I gave you folks

428
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464

429
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488

431
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
That's another thing

432
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,936
If you'll stoking the competitive spirit

433
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
You don't need the adjustment

434
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,776
Suburban nuclear indicator Victor

435
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,848
Google operates on a pretty straightforward points

436
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152
System predicated on the quantity of words

437
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,760
But it's supposed to be scoring on the words qualities

438
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,576
All the more complex to

439
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,880
How many people

440
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
Realize it actually

441
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
Scrabble

442
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,792
The ultimate word game is based on the fact that it was designed by as fast as

443
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840

444
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Pick it up

The numbers of times a particular letter is used

451
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296

Spaghetti

453
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,904
Counting how many times any comes up how many times

454
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
Does Ed comes up with something say

00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,888
With FaceTime on this and then and then the actual story

459
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,008
Black dancer play of the game

00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Sorry scrap

461
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
But again where you can try them

462
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,784
Just by memorizing every two letter word

463
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
Never have my affair

464
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,904
I don't want Leslie to think I'm coasting a special

465
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952

Make yourself a chest

473
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
If you want to tell you

474
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,640
I think it's just empty that you open the box and

475
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,224
And you sit down with your group of friends you don't have to run around trying to find

476
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,016
Books suitable

477

You get on with it

482
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
More important

483
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
The plot summary

484
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680

Execration

504
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,944
When you've invented your game you need to name it

505
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,016
Something that indicates what's involved

506
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064

African speaking

00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
