Who brings them to ice cold drinks

44
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,264
The officers takes it

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,592
So their drinks and swirl the ice in their glasses

46
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
In at this moment

47
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
These cold drinks

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,456
Stripping with condensation

49
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016

But actually

53
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
The ice

54
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
Was the kind of miracle

55
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,488
That's our own Little Miracles Sam Greenspan

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
Because in 1860

57
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,072
B5 no one had refrigerators

58
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120
It wouldn't be for another half century

59
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
Until they started appearing in the US

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
Little loan India

61
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,032
Think about the ice in those officers glasses

62
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,360
If you were to zoom out from those glasses

63
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
In-N-Out

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
In-N-Out

65
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,968
And then zoom in on the United States

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
On Boston

67
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,808
On a frozen lake in the dead of winter

68
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
There

69
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
You find men working

70
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,488
You see a lot of men and horses and

71
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,840
A lot of activity going on and then you'll see horse-drawn plows

72
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,168
Pikes and and Pusher bars or poles

73
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
That's Rick Smith

74
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
Amateur historian of the American ice trade

75
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,592
All these people together we're on the lake

76
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
Harvesting ice

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
What are some cut ice out of a frozen pond

78
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
Haul it to Port

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
Put it on a ship

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
And send it on a

81
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
4 month journey to India

82
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,952
Any ice that British officers in colonial India would have had in their drinks would have started out

83
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
On the top of a pond

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
In Massachusetts

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,704
The tools of the ice trade vary by location but generally it went like this so the first step is to measure the

86
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:26,848
There's a small drill hole that's drilled in and a measurement taken of how thick the ice is because it had to be at least

87
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,432
14 in thick of ice was thick enough

88
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,760
The hold the team of workers and horses that would be assembled

89
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
Usually the day after Christmas

90
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
Clear off snow in debris

91
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,816
And then the horse-drawn ice plows would start to score the ice and they would do this all over the ice until

92
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,120
They had made a grid a grid on the ice

93
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
They going to make a checkerboard let's say

94
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:56,800
Workers would use giant hand saws Bandai spikes basically big sticks with sharp ends

95
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,896
Break up the squares of ice so that they were floating in the water

96
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:05,248
A steam powered conveyor belt with all these cakes of ice out of the water

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
And they would go through a planer

98
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,112
So each cake would become smooth

99
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:14,976
Then they be stacked in the nearby ice house

100
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
Hans device

101
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
Ice houses often had a railroad siding

102
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,655
So the ice could be loaded up onto a train and fight it off to the city

103
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,263
Using the Disney movie Frozen the ice harvesting scene is

104
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
Actually pretty accurate

105
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
At its peak

106
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,247
Ice harvesting happened on lakes all over New England New York Michigan

107
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,599
In the Poconos region of Northeastern Pennsylvania it was at one time

108
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
The major industry

109
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,719
My father actually worked on the ice harvesting back in the

110
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,815
1930s and 40s and in even into the 50s

111
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:56,959
This entire area the Poconos that was pretty much the only thing that you could do in the winter time for work but now

112
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,519
It's gone it just disappeared entirely

113
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
It's a bit sad in a way that

114
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
An industry it melted away is it

115
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:08,223
Here to also remember the Natural Ice industry is Gavin Weightman

116
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,319
I'm Gavin Weightman I live in London and I rights

117
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,367
Social history books Bailey

118
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,671
And one of my most successful book

119
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:22,559
What's called the frozen water Trade One edition of the book is actually titled the frozen water trade

120
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
A true story

121
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:30,239
Maybe because even Gavin Publishers thought the prospect of cutting frozen water out of American lakes and shipping

122
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
Overseas

123
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
Sounded made up

124
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
But that is exactly what happened

125
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,431
Ice was being harvested from all over the American Northeast

126
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,735
Tacked onto railroad cars and ships

127
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
And sent out to the southern us

128
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
The Caribbean

129
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
And British colonists

130
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
In India

131
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,023
The development of the International Ice trade can be traced back to one person

132
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
A man who

133
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,143
By the end of his life would come to be known as the Ice King

134
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
A guy named Frederic Tudor

135
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,007
He was the son of Bulger today

136
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
Willow

137
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Boston

138
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
Family

139
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,407
I think it'd be a very old broke sorry I shouldn't use the Webelo if it's an English stuff

140
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
Tamisha message Centre

141
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:18,111
Mount router did not invent the idea of moving frozen water from one place to another

142
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,975
The practice actually began in Europe and South America well before Tutor Time

143
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,815
People would go up to the mountains and bring down ice and snow

144
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,119
Oboe tutor might not have known about this

145
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,519
But he did know that new englanders had a local tradition of cutting ice at a local lakes and using it to keep food cool

146
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,847
When Frederic Tudor was a young man

147
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
Pharmasset they did keep ice

148
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,991
Which I collected the winter and then when they were taking saved us about hits

149
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,295
In the summer they would take if it of this ice

150
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
In order to prevent it from melting

151
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,415
Chat with you on a small scale in that way

152
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,743
But it wasn't put into drinks and that sort of thing

153
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
And it was very localized

154
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,399
When Tudor was in his early twenties he and his brother William took a trip to the Caribbean

155
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
Enneathought

156
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
These people

157
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
Need ice

158
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,079
Chutas idea was that he was going to make his fortune because

159
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
I swear

160
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,687
A frozen assets of New England it wasn't being used

161
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
He felt he could set it

162
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,295
Particulator country switch over

163
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
I don't have no eyes

164
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,623
At least he delivered it to them

165
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,183
From Boston lakes and ponds

166
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,511
And he was absolutely

167
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Crazy

168
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,839
The tutor was convinced that this could work

169
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Hockey

170
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,679
He wrote that selling ice would make him quote

171
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,495
Inevitably and unavoidably Rich

172
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,639
Tudor set up shop on the banks of a pond called Fresh Pond in Cambridge Massachusetts

173
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,455
Just about 2 miles Northwest of Harvard Square

174
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,271
And after he learned how to get ice out of the lake

175
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,855
Tudor started looking for new ways to keep Ice Frozen

176
00:07:54,111 --> 00:08:00,255
Experimented with all sorts of insulating materials because remember this is more than a hundred years before refrigerator

177
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,303
Has began appearing in people's houses

178
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,143
He discovered that sawdust was a remarkably good insulator

179
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,471
Can you could get it for next to nothing from Lumber Mills in May

180
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,287
Kept inside of a dry ice house in pack

181
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
The sawdust

182
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,151
Eventually discover that he could keep ice stable

183
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
4 years

184
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,503
To all tutor had to do was get the ice onto a ship

185
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
And send it to hotter climates

186
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,879
His first attempt to settle ice outside bus

187
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
Was made with a little shipment

188
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
Jamal Siddiqui

189
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
Triple student leadership ice

190
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
Ridiculous cargo

191
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,631
So he fitted out to ship himself

192
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:44,031
The ice made it to the Caribbean no problem but Martinique was not equipped to deal with a temperature-sensitive product that

193
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,615
Literally melts into something worthless without the right infrastructure

194
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,711
It was a bit of a failure really because when it go to Varsity

195
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Lebanon New Hampshire

196
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,599
Keep ice erosion trailer of using entry of it is.

197
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
The fact that people

198
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,743
Rap that piece of ice and blank is Eduardo for wondered why was it disappeared when they got home

199
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
The newspaper's ridiculed

200
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,095
Tutor tutor would not be discouraged

201
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,679
He went back to the Caribbean and to the Southern United States

202
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,751
And show people their how to build more effective Ice House

203
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
And it worked

204
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:21,151
Frozen water carved out of lakes and ponds was being transported hundreds

205
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
Thousands of miles

206
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
He had a rough time getting it

207
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
Bankruptcy

208
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
A couple of times but he did

209
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
Banished in the end

210
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,671
But for all of tutors innovation in insulation and

211
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
Supply chain Logistics

212
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
Is true genius

213
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Was as a marketer

214
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
For tutor

215
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,351
Pyside mostly just been used to preserve food stuffs

216
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
Frederic Tudor

217
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,215
Pioneered the radical idea of putting ice

218
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
Indie beverages

219
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
What do fish drink

220
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
Cold drinks like that when you were not used to it

221
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
It's going to shock

222
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,711
She had to persuade people that what he was setting

223
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
Was it luxury Edwards

224
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Painful

225
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,087
Tutor with couches ice around

226
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
Mm song

227
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,951
Alfred from free try this try that

228
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,999
He have to persuade people

229
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
That what he was

230
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
Setting Woods

231
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
A guide to improve their lives

232
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
It wasn't self-evident to them

233
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,727
The first one as they say is always free

234
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Tudor Road

235
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,823
Once people had tried chill drinks they were hooked

236
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,383
And would no longer tolerate tepid water

237
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,687
He was a bit like a soda drug pusher

238
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
And like any drug pusher

239
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,575
Tudor soon found himself with a lot of competition

240
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:37,439
Rival ice company set up shop on tutors Fresh Pond and staked a claim to it

241
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,279
In fact they had to go get a Harvard Professor to devise a map

242
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
Carving up boundaries

243
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
For the ice rights of different parties

244
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
All on the same Lake

245
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,543
And of course it wasn't just Fresh Pond because now anybody water that was frozen thick enough to support the weight of a nice huh

246
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
Harvesting fruit with a hot commodity

247
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:59,199
Ice began to get harvested all over New England and York Pennsylvania in Canada

248
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,271
What is Twitter's competitors the Wenham Lake ice company

249
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,343
Base. Of Wenham Lake about 30 miles north of Boston

250
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,927
Somehow they managed to persuade their buyers that their ice

251
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
Was premium product

252
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Ice

253
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,559
From Lakewood B sodas especially.

254
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:19,935
It was nonsense really but it was a way of boxing you know all rights is better than yours

255
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,031
Legend has it that Queen Victoria would only use Wenham Lake ice

256
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:30,687
And maybe you're thinking why would England need to import ice all the way from North America when there are plenty of really cold

257
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,271
Places that are closer Norway wondered the same thing

258
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,343
Norwegian business man tried breaking into the ice biz

259
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,439
Even going so far as to rename one of their Lakes Wenham Lake

260
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,791
In an attempt to profit from the Wyndham Lake ice companies prestige in

261
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
Name recognition

262
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,983
Predators company never made a play for the UK ice Market which turned out to be a pretty good business move because I sniff

263
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
Never really took off in England

264
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
Even in the 20th century

265
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,407
American gi's in England were shocked to find nothing but warmbier

266
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,455
And there was several in the Air Force

267
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,807
Who said they would put their drinks in the back of a plane

268
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
Add flight to about 25000

269
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Feet

270
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Chill a little bit

271
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
At least

272
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
But there's one place where Brits

273
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
Could not get enough ice

274
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
India

275
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
So this is three months

276
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
In the hold of a ship

277
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
Bicycle seat playset

278
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
It was quite a remarkable

279
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,847
Survival rate for the ice which was eventually

280
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,895
Unloaded in Palm Bay is it was

281
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
Cold then metris

282
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
Casa

283
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
Despite all this

284
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,879
Tudor never really became an inevitably and unavoidably Rich like he predicted

285
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
Is whole life

286
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
He was in and out of debt

287
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
End debtors prison

288
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,535
And he eventually became

289
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
Particular

290
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Well enough off

291
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
Auntie Porsche this state

292
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
Outside

293
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
Boston

294
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
And

295
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
Lipstick kind of

296
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
But still

297
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
It wouldn't be until

298
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
40 years after Tudors death

299
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
Squarely in the 20th century

300
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,527
Did the Natural Ice industry began to shift

301
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:16,927
The earliest refrigerator started appearing in the 19 teens but the early models broke all the time

302
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
The physics of cooling proved

303
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
Harder to master than eating

304
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
And of course you had to have electricity

305
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,399
Which most home in the US didn't have until the 1920s

306
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,215
Slowly but surely the technology kept improving

307
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
And consumers began to have a choice

308
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,615
I'm getting Natural Ice scraped off the top of a frozen pond

309
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
Or ice made in a factory

310
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
Where the water can be better control

311
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Sand filter

312
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
Which started to get more important

313
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,319
Because as the charm screw

314
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,903
As buildings grew up around Fresh Pond on the other

315
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,463
Lakes that we used for supply

316
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Sewage would get into them

317
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
It became a health hazard

318
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,351
I just became a great problem

319
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Sinatra license

320
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,447
And to make matters worse for the naturalized trade

321
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,287
The Northeast experienced a Spate of unusually warm winter

322
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,943
The ponds would have been supplying the world's eyes weren't freezing as well the newspapers will calling it an ice pan

323
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
Supply region shifted northward

324
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
Towards Main

325
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
Where the climate was colder

326
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
And the water less polluted

327
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
By then

328
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
The writing was on the wall

329
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:24,511
The Natural Ice trade was on its way out in the 1920s but hung on in some places

330
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
Especially brutal places

331
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
Until as late as a 1950

332
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,399
And Ice Harvest still happen in some places

333
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
There's A Renewed interest in the tradition

334
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,031
In Pennsylvania and all over New England

335
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
There are some ice Harvest Revival

336
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,223
But you know what some updated tools and it's all Morpher Heritage value

337
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,343
It's only people are still putting frozen pond water

338
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Are there drinks

339
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:01,631
But as for the actual site where all of this started Fresh Pond in Cambridge Massachusetts

340
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,959
The ice trade might as well have never existed

341
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
When was researching the story

342
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
I stayed up in Cambridge

343
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
And I went out

344
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
The fresh pot

345
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
People with joking around

346
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
Update they were confronted by me this

347
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,575
Dematting disrespect excuse me

348
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
Juno

349
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
This ice used

350
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Speed

351
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
Transported to India

352
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
From this pain

353
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
Get me as if I was completely

354
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Mad

355
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
So at Fresh Pond there's no

356
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
No

357
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
No

358
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,311
Cambridge Massachusetts has finally found something to not

359
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Commemorate

360
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
With a plan

361
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,655
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Sam Greenspan with Katie minka-lavery truckman Kurt Kolstad Delaney Hall

362
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,447
Sharif Youssef and me Roman Mars

363
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,103
Special thanks to Rosie Weinberger Steve Arlo Tejada and Dylan Garrett Smith who reached out to us about this.

364
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:21,759
We are project 91.7 kalw San Francisco and produced out of the offices of arcsin in architecture and interior

365
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
Beautiful

366
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Downtown

367
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
