I'm Roman Mars

29
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,720
You know when you notice something for the first time and suddenly it's

30
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
Everywhere

31
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,328
My friend Julie Shapiro has a thing for personified teeth

32
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
On dentist signs

33
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,680
With a cartoon tooth often as a smile and Teeth of its own

34
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
I always notice things now

35
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,312
That an ant more pies pigs were selling themselves as BBQ

36
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
That always gives me the creeps

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,504
And one day I noticed that sign store scene of the ones that print homemade banners and posters for you always without fail have the

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,344
Ugliest collection of signs with a horrible fonts in their front windows

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,952
Now I can't pass one on the street without taking a picture to document the ironic tragedy

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
Lots of things are like this for all of us on staff we can get obsessed with tiny little designs laurentia and this is what

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,168
Happened to producer Avery trufelman

42
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
It was just a

43
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,240
Shape a basic little shape

44
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,800
It's rendered in concrete on a building by my house

45
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,384
Its pattern in an office doorway down the street

46
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
Imagine

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
A simple stylized

48
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,248
Four leaf clover flattened

49
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,272
With no stem

50
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
Very symmetrical

51
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,624
I took a walk and I found this shape in 10 different places

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,696
It was embroidered on bedding with plastered on wallpaper

53
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,536
Was patterned in a public garbage can you'll see it anywhere you see

54
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
Great

55
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Gothic Revival

56
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
The Cathedral of Saint John the Divine in New York

57
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
Washington Cathedral

58
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
You will also see it

59
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
In

60
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,312
Domestic architecture in the

61
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,104
Great as they're called cottages

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
It's down in Newport Rhode

63
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,224
Here in California it's a Hallmark of mission style homes

64
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,296
Expunge it just sucks up meaning

65
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
However

66
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
You wanted to be used

67
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,416
This is Christy Anderson

68
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
My name is Christy Anderson I'm an architectural historian and I teach at the University of Toronto

69
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,352
Talking about the quatrefoil

70
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
Cuz four leaf clover like shape

71
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,984
There's nothing that I can think of like the quatrefoil witch

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Appears

73
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
In so many different

74
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
Forum

75
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
Over such a long period of time

76
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
It could be endlessly

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
Reinterpreted

78
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
Really understood

79
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,112
Which architectural and art historian

80
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
Sometimes referred to

81
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,440
Is iconographical drift

82
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
Constantly sort of shift

83
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,536
Depending on where it's used

84
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
Who's using at what purpose they're using it

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
But no matter where it's used

86
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,704
Implies the same thing

87
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Fanciness

88
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,664
In this painting is symbol is very basic

89
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
To reiterate

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
The shape

91
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Is

92
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Like

93
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
Four leaf clover

94
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,576
With the in its simplest form

95
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,648
You can pronounce it the French way

96
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
If you would like

97
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
Meaning for leaves

98
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,768
But the American pronunciation works

99
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
2

100
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:23,167
It's hard to know for sure why the quatrefoil is the global fancy shape

101
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,239
There aren't that many resources on the subject

102
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543
You know nobody's really worked on it

103
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,127
But Christy Anderson is a good person to connect the dots

104
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,223
I rummaged around I looked and I just started sort of thinking about it

105
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,527
Questions as weird as it come from

106
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
Pure out of now

107
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:47,487
Christy Anderson says it just by looking at the shape you can see it has roots in Islamic or Moorish architecture

108
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
That kind of organic shape

109
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
Comes out of a geometric

110
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Forum

111
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Almost

112
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
All of them have some kind of Islamic

113
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
Origins

114
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Partly because

115
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
The great map

116
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Magicians

117
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
Working on early Islamic art

118
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
And the quadruple made its way to Europe

119
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
The other Silk Road

120
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
Do small objects

121
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
Could be transported

122
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
With early carpets

123
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Velvet

124
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
Silks

125
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
Broad and tiara

126
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
As Luxury Auto

127
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,903
When's the quatrefoil made its way to Europe

128
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
It was incorporated into tracery

129
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,511
Which is the stone framework for big stained glass windows

130
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:25,375
Quatrefoil shaped Stone frames were considered beautiful because the quatrefoil

131
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
With difficult to make

132
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
The fanciness of the shape

133
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,775
Is because it requires a certain amount

134
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,127
Mathematical skill but also craftsmanship

135
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:42,527
They could have used much simpler forms they could use Simple Diamond forms you're seeing something

136
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
Which really shouldn't be made out of

137
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
Hard hits

138
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Colts forum

139
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:53,023
Stone Sour only appeared in places that could afford them like churches

140
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
And because it appeared in churches

141
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,399
This simple shape could take on Christian meaning

142
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,519
Just think of anything in the Christian tradition that comes in a set of four

143
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
Or a variation on a cross

144
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
It's a Greek cross with

145
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
Equal arms on all sides

146
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
I'm sure people who use the quad

147
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
Well now

148
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
Will not sit there and

149
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
Count to you

150
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
The two about this

151
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,647
Islam and metalwork involve all of this

152
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,535
If you Google the image you'll find a lot of modern interior designers talking about the trendiness of the quatrefoil

153
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,631
I was just amazed I found like about 7 interior designer

154
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
The quatrefoil is

155
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,007
The shape that I'm using it on my wallpaper at all these

156
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
What do they think they're doing

157
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
Schlage when they're doing

158
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,943
My name is Brooke Taylor and I am an interior designer at arcsine architecture

159
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
You work

160
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Two desks away from me

161
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,111
Wework inside arcsin an Architecture Firm in Oakland

162
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,439
Brooke is designing the interior of a big hotel in Palo Alto

163
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,303
I asked her about the quatrefoil when I saw a picture of a quatrefoil shaped table

164
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
On her desk

165
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:03,423
I believe what you saw was an end table that were using where it's the barbed quatrefoil

166
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
And

167
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,007
It's basically the shape of the tabletop

168
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,847
Brooke says quatrefoil which is also a correct pronunciation

169
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
Interdesign for the lobby has a lot of quatrefoils in it

170
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
Mark Hatcher boils

171
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:20,063
Here's a rug that were using in the lobby that is literally overlapping patch

172
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,159
Boils and Brooke actually didn't do this intentionally I didn't even realize

173
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:29,535
Until well basically just now that that cash referral table is going to be on the

174
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,935
Overlapping catch well drug and close by there's also a chair with quatrefoil fabric just happened that way

175
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
Oil just has an appeal

176
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
It is

177
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
At Heart of very

178
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
Simple shape

179
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,199
But somehow there's just a formality to it

180
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,271
You can tell that there's a history behind the TV if you don't know what it is

181
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
You can tell that it

182
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
Out of History somewhere

183
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,439
And so to then take that and reinterpreted into a modern form

184
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
I think has a pill for

185
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
Four people for the way we see the quatrefoil in modern interior design is not referencing Gothic tracery directly

186
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
Surprise price

187
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:12,799
The quatrefoil shape first came back in style in a big way in the 19th century

188
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,663
During the Gothic Revival. In the Industrial Revolution was in full swing

189
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:23,039
People were seeking style inspiration from the pre-industrial era

190
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,831
And kind of harkening back

191
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,367
A simpler time

192
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,487
The Gothic Revival movement was also Around The Time Of The Addictive Mania craze

193
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
When new archaeological digs were

194
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
Popping up all around the world

195
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,887
It was all very new was like oh my God they

196
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,959
Discovered these tombs in Egypt and uncovering

197
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,751
Roman ruins in

198
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
Greek ruins

199
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,895
Bring all those influences in and also Reviving some interest in Gothic

200
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
Text designers were looking to the Past

201
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
And around the globe for inspiration

202
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
They travel

203
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Photographing

204
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Sketching

205
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,415
Digging into archives and collecting patterns Motif some shapes that they found inspiring

206
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,719
And they would publish these findings

207
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
In so-called

208
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Pattern book

209
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
In the second half of the

210
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,143
19th century historian Christy Anderson again

211
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
There was

212
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
Flourishing

213
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,263
Of Architects and designers

214
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
Who created

215
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
Pattern book

216
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,615
Books of designs which could be used

217
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
By Architects Masons

218
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:27,807
Craftsman really in any field so didn't matter whether you were doing painting or tile work

219
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
These were

220
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Cycling

221
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,671
Tedious of design of which the most famous One

222
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
Was the grammar of ornament

223
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,279
Which was published by man named Owen Jones

224
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,071
Owen Jones was an architect

225
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,887
Who took a special interest in ornament and pattern

226
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,983
I mean if you've never seen owen-jones as books they are so

227
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Beautiful

228
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Big book

229
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
His book

230
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:56,479
The grammar of ornament that has pages and pages of pure pattern

231
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
The most part

232
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
Colorful

233
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Squares of

234
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,111
Pattern from buildings all over the world

235
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
India you've got

236
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
Chinese you have Moorish

237
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
Celtic Turkish tour

238
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
Wallpapers

239
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
Owen Jones book

240
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
So the transformed

241
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,007
The whole way in which design was created because now you had the

242
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Annie's patterns

243
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
Which work

244
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
Leafly disconnect

245
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
From their original funk

246
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
They were just forms

247
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Printed on the

248
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,039
Many of the forms across many of the cultures Jones documented

249
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Work watches

250
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Chick-fil-A

251
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
It was particularly Owen Jones's work

252
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
The grammar of ornament

253
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Where the quatrefoil had

254
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
Very important

255
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
Place

256
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Part

257
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
A number of different pages on

258
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
On ornaments

259
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
Repeated over and over again

260
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
And certainly

261
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
Spurred on the interest

262
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
And this

263
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Forum

264
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
In the later 19

265
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
Dinnerly 20%

266
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:02,271
Designers still use these pattern books for inspiration

267
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Down in the sea

268
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
60 yuan

269
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
Combat veteran

270
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Renaissance

271
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,047
And it would seem that Jones succeeded in his mission for his butt

272
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
He hoped the grammar of ornament

273
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,167
Provide context and background for these patterns

274
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,519
And that they would be a source of inspiration which anyone and everyone could use

275
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
But today part of the quatrefoils fancy symbolism comes from the modern luxury brand that have associated with it

276
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,991
Many of which are clamoring to own it

277
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,063
Louis Vuitton had a lawsuit over use of the quatrefoil

278
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,903
Luxury jewelry David Yurman trademark the word quatrefoil

279
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:45,535
Another Jewelry Company Van Cleef & Arpels is fiercely litigious over its claim to the shape

280
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,935
There is a power about this simple form which is everywhere and it has no steady associations with any specific

281
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
The country or movement

282
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:58,591
This is what separated from other ornamental forms like the fleur-de-lis or even the swastika

283
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,479
The Middle Ages seriously their patterns Middle Ages in here

284
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
And you see the barbecue

285
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,439
How can you copyright that the best thing about the grammar of ornament are the pages and pages of beautiful pattern

286
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,767
But Jones is brief introduction is also really interest

287
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:22,143
Init Jones was 37 propositions for the creation of good decorative design

288
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
General principles in the arrangement of

289
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,519
Form and color in architecture and the decorative Arts

290
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,055
Witcher advocated throughout this work

291
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,383
I'm at the most people just skipped right over these and get to the pretty stuff

292
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
It's an interesting mix

293
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Of statements

294
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Annies Papas

295
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,015
Proposition for them

296
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
Philosophy

297
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
Absolutely

298
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,367
True beauty results from that repose

299
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,719
The minefields in the intellect any affections are satisfied from the absence of

300
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
If any wants

301
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
Extremely philosophical

302
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,839
And then you have something as basic as proposition

303
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,399
26 colors

304
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
Black round spider

305
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
But I think

306
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,239
Proposition 13

307
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Unlocks the logic

308
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,335
Behind the inherent attractiveness of the quatrefoil

309
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,407
Flowers are other natural objects should not be used as ornaments

310
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,479
A conventional representations founded upon them

311
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
Sufficiently suggestive

312
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
To convey the intended image to the mind

313
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,391
Without destroying the unity of the object they are employed to decorate

314
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
Porta Translate

315
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Baseball

316
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:23,839
Don't you put a bird on it designs don't necessarily look good

317
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,679
According to Jones the best kind of designs imply nature

318
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:32,031
Bookkeeping with composition

319
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Ethical constructs

320
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,895
The quatrefoil is both geometrical and natural

321
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
But without being too floury

322
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,551
And this just might be what attracts designers to it over and over again

323
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,111
And keeps it forever floating around us

324
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,647
And iconographical drip

325
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,655
My boys were born and quatrefoil say building in Chicago the Prentice Women's Hospital at Northwestern

326
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,311
The whole building is in the shape of a quatrefoil as seen from above who's cool looking but according to the people at Northwestern

327
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,895
It was a pretty impractical shape from Modern Research Hospital

328
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
So it's been demolished

329
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,015
A lot of people including myself or sad to see it go

330
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,599
A safe princess group trying to get that building Landmark status

331
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
Petitions were circulated

332
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
The effort ultimately fail

333
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,511
But I think it's safe to say that no one would have cared at all

334
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
The building was not shaved

335
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
Like a quatrefoil

336
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:56,767
99% invisible was pretty sweet by Avery trufelman with Katie mingle same Greenspan and me Roman Mars

337

And produce are the offices of arcsin a brilliant Architecture Firm in beautiful Downtown Oakland California

339
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,639
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

340
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,199
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

341
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
If

342
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,831
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

343
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:26,719
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and

344
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,511
Technology talk to us

345
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
It is a creation of Sonic trash

346
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,887
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

347
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:39,263
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology to make them more human

348
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
Turn the living room lights on

349
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
Okay

350
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,687
Dim the living room lights

351
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
50%

352
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Okay

353
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:55,903
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

354
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,719
Makes for a much more natural experience

355
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
Turn the living room lights on

356
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
Dim the living room lights to 50

357
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
80%

358
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

359
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
Landscape is impacting our health

360
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,919
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

361
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,735
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

362
