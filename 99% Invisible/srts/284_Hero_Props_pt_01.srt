I'm Roman Mars

20

When do movies come out most of the praise goes to the director and lead actors

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,336
There's so many other people involved in a film

22
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
And a lot of them

23
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
Our designers

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,944
There are costume designers and set designers

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736

That you might see in a phone

29
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,880
And I do mean

30
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,416
Every single

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952

Interesting bits

33
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
Lettering on it and a thing with patent on it than anything with illustration on it and most things made out of paper

34
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
This is Antioch

35
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,448
My name is Daniel

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
Anaheim

37
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
Designer for

38
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,776
The film industry

39
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,872
Over the course of her career Atkins has design all kinds of traffic

40
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
Telegrams

41
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,248
Vintage cigarette packaging Ops glasses

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,296
Books

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,464
Any kind of chocolate box food packaging and labeling passports

44
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
CIA

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Identification card

46
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,400
And with all of these objects Atkins needs to choose or design the lettering and make sure the

47
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
The paper is

48
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
Just wright

49
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,240
All these small design decisions

50
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
That contribute to

51
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,312
To creating a cohesive visual world

52
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
For the fountain

53
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,944
A scarf designs film already have two main priorities when we start designing any

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
Proper set piece

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,552
The first is to set the. And the second is deceitful okay

56
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:37,696
Patient so that when the audience start watching a movie they know immediately where the story is being told and when it's 2

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,304
But I think the other thing that we have to do is we have

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
2

59
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
Also try to tell the story of hand as well

60
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
With graph

61
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
So for example

62
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,848
If you see a sign in the backgrounds of a New York Subway scene

63
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,152
It says Walk Don't Run

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,272
You can bet any seconds after you see that the characters are actually going to start running

65
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,088
All the graphic design you seen a film has a job.

66
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
It's moving the story forward

67
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,488
Easy background signage seems to have a kind of a subliminal message

68
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,840
It's always put there on purpose everything that we put in front of the camera

69
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
Is that for a reason

70
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,984
I met Annie Adkins at the aiga national design com

71
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
And I interviewed her on stage and I just

72
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,824
Loved hearing her talk about a work

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
So I asked her to

74
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
And today

75
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
We're just going to run

76
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
So let's start at the beginning

77
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
How did you get into this

78
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:40,672
My very first job was on a TV show called The chutas which we made here in Dublin and Ireland

79
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
About 10 years ago now

80
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
And I went for an interview

81
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,840
For the job as an assistant the art Department

82
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,680
But when they sell my portfolio they realized I came from a graphic design background

83
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
They said we're actually looking for full-time

84
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
Graphic designer

85
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
On the show

86
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Gradle

87
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Pieces

88
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
And I couldn't understand this because

89
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
It didn't make sense why they would need

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,784
A graphic designer on a show that was set in a. Before graph

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
Designer

92
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,416
I confirm this advertising background while we were making

93
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
Logo design website

94
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
Magazine layout

95
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
And there were none of these things in

96
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
The cost of

97
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Henry VIII

98
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,447
But then I learned very quickly when I started the job.

99
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
Just because

100
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
They weren't any graphic designers

101
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,151
In the 15th Century doesn't mean that wasn't graphic design is just that at that time it would have been the craftspeople who are the designers

102
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
So

103
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
For example

104
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,783
Hannity 8 forms to chop his wife head off

105
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
He's going to need a death warrant

106
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
And if he needs a death warrant

107
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
He's going to need a calligrapher

108
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Because at that time

109
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,535
It would have been the calligrapher who is responsible for the layout

110
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
The Royal Scrolls and documents and also the

111
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Style at the light

112
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,423
So you become the graphic designer for the

113
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
15th century

114
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Yeah

115
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:04,127
Exactly so now it's the graphic design is Rolling Stones a day to try to imitate both across teeth would have done weather.

116
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
The

117
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
Ironmonger all the Glazier

118
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
All the stone Mason

119
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,575
Talk us through the process like how do you begin how do you know

120
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,623
What your job is going to be what does it mean to

121
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
To be a graphic designer on

122
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
For certain

123
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,303
First of all I never know what my next job is going to be so I can't really

124
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:27,167
I can't really prepare myself and I can't really learn every skill that I'm going to need

125
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
It's like I don't know if my next job is going to be

126
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,567
Sex in Victorian London or if it's going to be on a spaceship

127
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
200 years in the future

128
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,759
So what happens is I got the call I arrive on sats I set up my tool cast I sit down with the scrap

129
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,599
And they go through the script on by mock house and a thing that sounds like it might

130
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
A piece of graphic

131
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
Design

132
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,487
And while I'm making this list which we call a script breakdown

133
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,303
I'm also beginning to research the periods

134
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
All the genre all the

135
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,631
The storyline that I'm designing

136
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
I do that for about 6

137
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,775
Six to eight weeks prep and then shooting starts during that time

138
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
Time is always against me and I'm

139
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Stuff out

140
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407
How often are you making stuff

141
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
Right before someone else

142
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
To hold it on

143
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Film

144
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,367
Will we try to get everything made if it's a prop then we tried to get it made at least a week

145
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,415
Before it's shots on

146
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
Because inevitably going to be some

147
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
Changes that need to be made

148
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,167
When I was working on the Grand Budapest Hotel I had to make a notebook for a fine to start to do stuff

149
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
Andrew stuff is very

150
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
Precise character

151
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
When refunds came in for his costume fitting

152
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,639
He had his notebook and all the other props that he needed

153
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
The first character

154
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,527
And he just noticed that they would no lines in the notebook could give him and made him a notebook with

155
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
App like pages

156
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,415
Question. Because is Khartoum so precise he thought maybe it would have

157
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
It should have lines in it

158
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,279
So we took the truck back up to the studio and we remade the notebook

159
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
Send it back down again with lines and I was fine

160
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
But then

161
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,959
After the film came out and I started doing some magazine interviews about

162
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
Designing graphic props

163
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
I use this is my

164
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,359
An example because I thought it was quite interesting and quite a good example of

165
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
The level of detail that react

166
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
You going to

167
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,735
But of course all the gentlest head was that

168
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
I was saying that Ray Fiennes are some kind of Diva

169
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:25,951
So actually I actually stopped using that as an example of because that's not what I was saying at all you know

170
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,767
It's really it's his job to make sure that

171
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
The props are rice and this our job to make sure that the props arise and this is just the kind of back-and-forth the everyday biking.

172
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,215
Let me go straight when making things for phones

173
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
So when you're doing that script

174
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
Breakdown

175
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,639
What are some of the keywords that you're looking for that indicate that you have work to do

176
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
In that scene

177
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
That always stops me in my tracks

178
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
When I'm reading a script

179
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
Would be the word of

180
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,343
Because offices are just absolutely full

181
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
Of paperwork

182
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
You know like notice boards

183
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
Filing cabinets

184
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
Covered in all kinds of paper whip

185
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,327
So that's a huge that's a huge step for the graphics

186
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Apartments

187
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
There are lots of scenes it

188
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
Have a very low volume

189
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,447
Graphics not really like

190
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
You can kind of skim read

191
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
Sexy

192
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Do you have a

193
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:16,639
Liberty have a pulled out a newspaper I'll start looking in the mouth

194
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
So funny

195
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
Let's talk a little bit about so once you get

196
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,135
The list of things that your have to work on you begin to research

197
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
What those things are what they are like

198
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
For this phone

199
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
And

200
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
Could you describe what the research is

201
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Dislike

202
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,959
So I start my research I do a little bit of research online

203
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,799
But I find that looking things up on the internet can be misleading

204
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
Trick of the reasons

205
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Festival

206
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:54,271
Nobody really ever labels anything property online like if you find if you find a beautiful vintage map

207
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:59,391
Tan Tumblr that's absolutely no way it's going to tell you what year is From about the dimensions of it are

208
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,975
And then also it's really difficult to judge

209
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023
By looking at pictures on a screen

210
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
Scale of things and also that extra things

211
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,655
If I have to make a telegram

212
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
For example

213
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
I really need

214
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
To go to a flea market

215
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,567
Cast and find an old hologram that I can hold in my hands

216
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,639
And then I know what kind of paper to make it out of Amino X

217
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,735
I'm so I do a lot of my research

218
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:29,855
NC markets in junk shops buying old pieces on eBay

219
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,903
Rating my grandmother's elastic

220
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
That kind of thing

221
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,279
What are some of the other sharks like so you do everything by hand when it

222
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Would have been done by hand

223
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
What is it

224
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
Take-two makeup

225
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Paper love

226
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
Cold

227
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,239
You know you're making it brand new and handing it somebody

228
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
How do you make a

229
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
Cement feel real

230
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
The aging process

231
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
For Prague

232
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
Is a little bit of a tricky balance

233
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Tightrope

234
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Because

235
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,039
The pieces usually should have been brand new at the time

236
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
At the time that the show is Seth in

237
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,159
When you're making a. Drama

238
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
A lot of the time audiences needs

239
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
See a little bit of beijing

240
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
To really believe

241
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
That there in the.

242
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,423
You know it's like we need we need to see the cracks in the converse of the oil painting

243
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
Because that's how we see it in the gallery

244
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
We need the paper to be

245
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
Off-white so slightly yellow

246
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
Because that's how we look at all.

247
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Commence now

248
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,455
But if you go too far in that direction

249
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,015
Then all of a sudden everything looks a bit like

250
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
I do not like an old pirate map

251
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Rice

252
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:39,743
There's a tricky balance and it varies from show so show some directors and production designers wants to go for real kind of CP

253
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
You look and everything

254
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
And then other directors

255
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
Wants to

256
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,959
Really work with the colors that they would have used at the time which is one of the reasons why it was so

257
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,543
Wonderful working for Wisconsin because he really

258
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
Like embrace

259
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
The the colors of the periods

260
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,455
Instead of doing that whole sepia-toned thing that we do a lot of

261
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
The time before waxing

262
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Some kind of

263
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Drama

264
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
Right

265
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,647
Is there another I want to get back to

266
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Grand Budapest

267
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
Hotel and West Anderson

268
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Second butt

269
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
Are there other examples of

270
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
Things that

271
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
You

272
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,655
Researched and you know what is accurate

273
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,215
The time for example of something being new when it was

274
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
It's actually new

275
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
But

276
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,311
You're balancing that against

277
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
Expectations of what

278
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
Want or expectations of

279
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Of the story

280
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
So that

281
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,783
For some reason the accurate representation is not the

282
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
Proper representation for

283
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
Thing that you need

284
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
What to do in that story

285
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,023
So we try to start every single prop that we make for a film with a real historical artifact

286
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
That we can

287
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
Coffee bicycle

288
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:51,935
And that means that we we're making things that feel really authentic instead of

289
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Like a movie prop

290
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,543
So what example would be newspaper design

291
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,615
Newspapers to use the Lost info because they're really

292
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
The really good storytelling

293
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,223
Advise if you need tell the audience that there's a war being fought

294
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,295
You can show a newspaper headlines thing that the Bull Run

295
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,903
Rather than she used to say she seconds possible sequence which is going to cost

296
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
How much money million dollars

297
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,279
So we would start with the real reference of a newspaper

298
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,095
Actually a lot of the time in

299
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Particularly in England

300
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,751
In the beginning of the twentieth century the broadsheet papers didn't actually have

301
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
Newspaper headlines on front pages at all

302
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
The front pages were covered in

303
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Small Lots

304
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,919
Advertising local businesses

305
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Awesome things for sale

306
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:42,111
So what I do when I start a project is I'll talk to the director in the production designer about this scene about bring them there

307
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,695
Information and tell them that this is actually what a newspaper front page was like

308
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
And then they make the call

309
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
Whether they want to stick with historical accuracy

310
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
Or they just want to ignore that

311
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
Designed the newspaper

312
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
To suit the story that that's how they

313
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,983
The line that gets bandied about

314
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
Fill knots Papa

315
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
And it always goes something like

316
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,663
We're not making a documentary about 19th century newspaper layouts

317
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
Telling story

318
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
Is there a part of you that

319
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,111
Really enjoys it when it's really accurate or is it

320
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Do you

321
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,671
Get more pleasure from it just

322
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
Being really good in serving the story

323
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
The best way possible

324
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,839
You get the most excited when you can just going to marry the two

325
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
It's exciting

326
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,447
To study real references

327
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,031
Because what I find a lot of the time is that

328
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
The truth is more info

329
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,967
You know like if if I started a prop with just a blank page in illustrator

330
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,807
I wouldn't be able to create something as interesting

331
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,463
As water is actually being designs before me ride like my imagination can't compare to the collective imagination of

332
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,535
Hundreds and thousands of craftspeople that have

333
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
Gone the family of the last

334
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
Hundreds of years

335
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,215
So it's interesting to look at something real

336
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
And then develop it with the director and the production designer to suit the story because then you can make something the feels

337
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
I'm sick but it's also

338
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
Interesting visually

339
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Until when I'm watching you work

340
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
And movies

341
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
You put a lot of time into

342
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
But

343
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,903
Do you want me to notice them

344
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
Or do you want me to

345
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
Kind of ignore them

346
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
I kind of feel the

347
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,423
If the audience is looking at my pieces of graph

348
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Design

349
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,495
Then this film isn't necessarily worth

350
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:39,103
Congrats to the attention of the audience should really be on the drama that

351
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
Unfolding between the car

352
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,711
Like the drum the drama between the humans

353
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,039
I think you should notice it but only subconsciously

354
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
Like we are building a world

355
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
Under using graphic design

356
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
To do that

357
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,999
But the pieces is so fleeting I don't think you should really

358
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
Register

359
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Everything consciously

360
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,887
When I watch things that I would come back with my m

361
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
Mosa

362
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,727
I'm always very keen that she notices everything

363
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:11,359
I made that I made that and she's always like boss

364
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
This is a conundrum of almost

365
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
Design that

366
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
The best stuff

367
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
Is meant to work in

368
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
Do its job

369
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,671
But kind of not be noticed in is there a

370
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
Estate of mind that you

371
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
Gotten into where you can

372
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,279
Except that

373
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Or is it

374
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
Just come naturally

375
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
I've never felt

376
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,959
Shih tzus in anyway. My work

377
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
Doesn't get

378
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Screen time

379
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,567
I only have a feel

380
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,871
Thrills when it does get a little bit of screen

381
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
There's something thrilling about

382
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
Having your way

383
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
Shown on a cinema screen

384
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
I don't know what it is

385
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,695
When I worked in advertising years ago you know I would design Billboards but I never got really excited

386
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
Driving past a billboard that I designed where is

387
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,583
If it if I'm sitting in the cinema on something gets like a

388
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,167
Fraction of a second of blurry

389
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,983
Screen time then just some reason I'm really excited by

390
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,335
I don't know what that is I suppose it's like the whole

391
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,407
How Hollywood star system thing getting to me

392
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,783
It's fair you give yourself that enjoyment

393
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
I'm peeing on a movie

394
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Screen

395
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
Have you ever

396
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,671
Really labored over something that got caught from a scene in that

397
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
The pain you at all

398
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,607
Yes you will come things all the time that you put a huge amounts backed into that just never gets seen

399
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
An adult on the

400
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
On screen or by the camera

401
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,983
I'm actually say that most of my work

402
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
It's like the

403
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
There are people who see it

404
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,943
And the people who see it all the actors and the director

405
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:56,319
And it's really like it's really exciting to Bill say for example a street scene

406
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,623
And put up all these then

407
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:04,511
Street posters in shop front signs and hunting signs and pieces of like. Advertising

408
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:11,167
Amazon CV axles arrived on SAS in the morning I'm taking the surroundings and really you can see them feeling like that

409
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
I've been transported to another time

410
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
And then

411
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,567
You know they go and they do that right thing and I I hope

412
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
But maybe

413
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,991
As film designers contributes little bits to them really getting in Spyro

414
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Yeah

415
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
Have you ever had an instance where

416
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
An actor really fell in love with a

417
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,671
Proper something that you made

418
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
I remember when we were shooting Grand Budapest

419
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
That was a prison scene

420
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,095
With Harvey Keitel and Ray Fiennes

421
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,471
Ray Fiennes was admiring the prison escape map

422
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,287
Harvey keitel's character ludvig

423
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
A drawn

424
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
Gustav

425
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,919
The character played by Ray Fiennes at Maya's it's autistic

426
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Promise

427
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,783
Remember when I read that script page being really excited because

428
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
It's very rare that

429
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,879
Characters in The Script admire a piece of graph

430
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,183
So I need

431
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,999
I knew that this is going to be a big one for the graphics Department

432
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,839
So we may as we made his prison escape map

433
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:17,215
And dab it was thrown up on the back of a piece of packaging paper so we also included

434
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
Packaging labeling post

435
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
Thompson

436
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,055
Frankie moxon

437
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,847
We really went all out song

438
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
Jason Mewes

439
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
These pieces for this imagine

440
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Country

441
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,015
And the Empire zebrowska that was it created

442
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,599
When Harvey Keitel arrived over from LA

443
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
To do the scene

444
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,719
He suggested that he and all the people in the

445
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
All the other actors

446
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
In the scene

447
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,375
Actually go and stay in the prison it was a real person that we were shooting in

448
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
Don't stay overnight in the prison

449
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,751
I'm take these props with them so that they could get into character

450
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,823
So that was really fun the thought of them all going off

451
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
To this remote prison in the east

452
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
Germany in the middle of February

453
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
In the snow

454
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,735
I'm taking the props that weed made

455
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
How to get into cars

456
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,367
If you were to pick up a script tomorrow what would you read in the script

457
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,671
That would make you really excited

458
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
To make that

459
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:16,607
I like designing things fast you have to design as a character in the film rather than as a graphic designer

460
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
Example of prison escape map

461
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,447
It's not really a graph

462
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,751
Set designers jobs traditionally

463
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Designer

464
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Stride

465
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:29,663
Set the prisoners job to draw it out themselves so you really haven't get into character and try to figure out

466
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,223
How that character

467
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,551
What tools they would have used

468
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
To do it you know what

469
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,927
But they've had access to Pennzoil charcoal crayons

470
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
What kind of paper with Dad

471
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,023
Access to and what would that style be like

472
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
What's that you mention that

473
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
You've the most part you work

474
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Isn't noticed in the

475
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,703
But with the

476
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
World of

477
00:19:54,239 --> 00:20:00,383
You know streaming video and the internet where people can pause in and discuss the graphic design of things

478
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,175
You know people do notice

479
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
And

480
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
Probably notice

481
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
Mistakes

482
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
Yeah

483
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,367
Is absolutely full of continuity errors

484
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,159
On the loss of them are about graphic

485
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Pieces

486
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,975
So one example is

487
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,023
When jumping is at the gas station

488
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,095
The calendar on the wall says October 1932

489
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
Vchos Oktoberfest

490
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
12/19 + 26

491
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
Sundays

492
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,287
In 1932 those dates fell on Wednesdays

493
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,663
When we made the calendar we didn't think to check the day's against

494
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,759
The dates of 1932 but then we didn't think anybody else would either

495
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,087
I can read that kind of thing thank

496
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,879
You know the Titans

497
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
But that right

498
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:48,767
And when I look back at the pieces that we made I see that yes there is never that

499
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,143
The next job I went on to it would have been Spielberg's Bridge of spies which was a true story

500
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
We made a lot of

501
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
A lot of newspapers without phone

502
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,799
And I remember speaking to check the dates against the days because I want some

503
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
To get it right

504
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:07,711
And then eventually the prop Master said to me you know what I think we just going to leave the dates off

505
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
Because

506
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:14,879
It wasn't clear the sequence of these things going to be shown in on he says you know if if you leave the days off altogether nobody

507
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Look fresh

508
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,232
But if you put something bad that's wrong then it might jump house

509
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
We went with no dates in the end suppose mean

510
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,376
So when you were doing the design for the Grand Prix

511
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Best hotel

512
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
There was

513
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
An error

514
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
I called him after we do a bunch of the war

515
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,056
And it was only little pink cake boxes and

516
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,104
From the fictional bakery called Mendel's

517
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
Can you tell us a

518
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
Halfway through the chute

519
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,344
Wisconsin section says I think there's a spelling mistake in the Mentos bulk

520
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,392
And I said

521
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
I don't think so because

522
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,792
Take such great pride in my spelling and grammar

523
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,376
And he said that has two T's and patisserie

524
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,216
I looked at the box and I realized that he was right

525
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
And of course

526
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
I had a blessed.

527
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,080
Suicide never gone through

528
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
Spell check

529
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:14,528
You know it's a word of French origin I really should have double-checked that I should have triple checked it and I just didn't

530
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,344
And at that point we had shot

531
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
So many medals boxes

532
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Wichita I think

533
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,440
2000 of them

534
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,256
And it has to be fixed in post-production

535
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:31,168
Which is great it's it's great that we have the option fixings and post but it's it's a kind of a lengthy process because you have to

536
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
Change

537
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,008
Whatever it is 25 frames per second

538
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,824
I am so it can be quite expensive as well

539
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
So that was embarrassing

540
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:46,016
Since the film was released the mendl's box is kind of Taken on a life of its own it's kind of become a bit of an icon

541
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
Come to the film so

542
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:53,952
People that people are selling them online and people making their own fake boxes and selling them and trying to pass

543
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,256
Real props from the movie

544
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,816
But I know when I look at them

545
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
But it has two T's and patisserie

546
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
Then

547
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
It was really in the movie

548
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
If you have to see a box with two T's in history

549
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
You should buy it

550
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,152
And these were really iconic looking and therein

551
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
IOS movies

552
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Pink Accu

553
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
And so

554
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
They're really up

555
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Very active

556
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Part of

557
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
Of the scenes at the ran

558
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
2

559
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,904
Yeah they're what we call a hero prop

560
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
Superhero props

561
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,232
Is any profit cats

562
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:31,584
A bit of screen time or has a kind of character of its own

563
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,192
You can generally tell what a hero prop is because it will have a description in the script

564
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
Like a lot of things that we make

565
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
Can't even mentioned in the scriptures

566
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Like

567
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,104
It doesn't it doesn't office scene

568
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,944
And it's just assumed that we will know what's address instead of

569
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,528
Festina the script won't go into details about notice boards and fighting cops

570
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,088
But a hero prop will always be at least

571
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,648
Names and mentioned and sometimes described

572
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,536
When we come back we'll hear from Annie about when the most difficult

573
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,688
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

574
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,272
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

575
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
If

576
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:29,696
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

577
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
Technology talk to us

578
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,632
It is a creation of Sonic trash

579
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,704
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

580
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,288
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

581
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,336
To make them more human

582
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,176
Turn the living room lights on

583
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
Okay

584
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,528
Dim the living room lights to 50%

585
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
Okay

586
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:02,720
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

587
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,024
Makes for a much more natural

588
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Experience

589
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
Turn the living room lights on

590
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
Dim the living room lights

591
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
50%

592
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,360
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

593
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,176
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

594
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,736
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

595

Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

596

Right here

597
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,208

00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:40,608
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives

599
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:47,008
Routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms

Black podcast

604
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,952
Soda follow up on this conversation next week

605
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,512
We're doing a whole episode on the design of fake money

606
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
The movies

607
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,328
And the challenges that profits on his face

608
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
Creating a currency that

609
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,680
That's a look real but not so real that they get busted for counterfeit

610
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
The preview that story

611
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,032
I asked any icons about her experiences

612
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
Designing money

613
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,128
So most of the time when I have to

614
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,456
Create currency for movie I'm really recreate

615
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,504
Because most movies are set

616
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
The real world

617
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,880
So I'll find vintage banknotes and I'll scan them

618
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,696
And reproduce them

619
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,000
There are problems with the

620
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,304
I think I was a shelf you know doesn't

621
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,096
Let you do this it tells you

622
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,656
It's it's an eagle that you can get around it with a

623
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424
A little hot

624
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:53,056
And then for things like Grand Budapest Hotel I was creating a

625
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,592
Fictitious currency because it was

626
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
Fictitious Empire

627
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
So

628
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,688
That was

629
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,320
It's in the sense that I didn't need to worry about legal Terrence but it was really tricky because

630
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,856
Designing a bunk gnosis

631
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
Really difficult I'm sure it takes

632
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:13,280
People months in years to design banknotes and you know we had whatever it was

633
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Fortnite

634
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,096
Brother legal considerations

635
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,400
When you're designing banknotes

636
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,728
Well yes you needs you need to get it past legal clearance

637
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,848
So things have to be changed slightly I mean I haven't actually made any Malden

638
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,920
Money because I've never done a contemporary movie

639
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:36,576
But I have designs things for example for the CIA and the FBI for true story

640
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,904
So we wanted to use the real logos

641
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
Of course because we want everything

642
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,280
Feel authentic but that doesn't get pastelitos parents so you have to do things like

643
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,608
Flip the eagle on the Department of State logo

644
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,984
You know you know in the the American seal it's an eagle holding things in his claws

645
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,520
Yeah like terrorism

646
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,616
Yeah you have to change what the eagle is holding him which way his head is facing

647
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:03,200
I guess this ain't the same

648
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
Currency as well

649
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:09,344
Do you want to hear a lot more about the dangers of Designing prop money

650
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,648
I have to do is listen the next week's

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

681
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,248
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a

682
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,296
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

683
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,576
We're looking the part

684
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,368
Might cost you your life

685
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:51,488
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

686
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:55,840
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

687
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:00,192
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

688
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:06,848
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff actually if I'm being honest

689
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,176
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing

690
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:16,576
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

691
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,904
Was found dead in my private gym

692
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,232
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

693
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,584
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

694
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
Now

695
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,912
I need to clear my name

696
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:36,288
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

697
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
