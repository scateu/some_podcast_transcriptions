I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,632
If I asked you to close your eyes

26
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,240
The mimic the action of using one of the Simplehuman interfaces in everyday life

27
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,520
You could probably do it

28
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
No problem

29
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
Without having a button to push

30
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
You can close your eyes

31
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,432
And pretend to push a button

32
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,272
And that action would accurately reflect the action of pushing a real button

33
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,064
Same with flipping switch

34
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
Start turning a doorknob

35
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,904
You close your eyes and fake the movement

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
It would sink up

37
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
With its real world use

38
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,072
Now if I asked you to do the same thing with a cars

39
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
Steering wheel

40
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,496
You think you'd be able to describe steering accurately and mine the correct movements with your hands in the air

41
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
But you'd be wrong

42
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
So wrong

43
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
You probably kill a bunch of imaginary people

44
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
But don't just take my word for

45
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
Even factors

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,064
His full name is Doctor Steve quote he just introduced themselves

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,832
Steve

48
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
He's a casual guy

49
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
And what was your research on

50
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
What's your mind

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,304
And that's Tristan cook and Thomas Nelson is also in the room they're asking

52
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
Steve Tristan and Tom run this awesome blog

53
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,400
Call humans and Design

54
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
My

55
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
Interests

56
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
Traffic behind

57
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
So here's the exercise

58
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
Put your hands up

59
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,128
And grip an imaginary steering wheel

60
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,736
Ellentube

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Changing lanes

62
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
To the right

63
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
Have you tried it

64
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
All right if you like most

65
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
And according to Steve's research

66
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,000
We're talking the vast majority of people

67
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,584
You turned your imaginary wheel 45 degrees to the right or so

68
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
And then back to the center

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,192
And that's the action for changing lanes

70
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
But

71
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
That's not right

72
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,336
What you describe is actually the secrets of magnets that

73
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
Iroquois School

74
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:35,296
Do I actually change lanes you have to turn the steering wheel to the right then turn it back crossing the Centerline

75
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,136
Turning the wheel and equal amplitude to the left to correct your heading

76
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
And then back to the center

77
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,256
Knowing that this weird brain hiccup existed

78
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,096
Steve's team of the University of Queensland tested people in driving simulator

79
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,912
Turn off if you provided visual feedback

80
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,960
People could change lanes no problem

81
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,336
But as soon as you turned off the screen or blindfolded them and told them to change lanes

82
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,688
Even though they're only just moments ago successfully perform the correct action

83
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
They couldn't do it

84
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
Buy produced pretty

85
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
Catastrophic errors

86
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
Given no other feedback

87
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
You can't change lanes

88
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
Using a steering wheel without vision

89
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,512
Recent cars are designed to be dreaming with your eyes open

90
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
That's okay

91
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,119
And in fact this is a funky example that doesn't mean that a steering wheel

92
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,167
Is a bad interface design

93
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,263
You probably argue the opposite You could argue that a steering wheel is so well design

94
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,103
That anyone can use it with just a little bit of feedback in the real world

95
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
Even though they can't

96
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,687
Describe how they use it in the abstract

97
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,295
Data science

98
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Expert

99
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Facts about 45 minutes

100
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Size of the Earth

101
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,815
But Stephens researchers decided to test this in a real car

102
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
So Steve got

103
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
I'm like 15 million dollars worth of insurance

104
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,751
It took people out in a real car and drove them down a test Road

105
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,055
And then took their Vision away

106
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
And ask them to change lanes

107
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:10,015
My friends Tristan to Tom where to the participants

108
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,855
It was absolutely terrifying

109
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,975
Little bit like when Obi-Wan Kenobi was teaching Luke Skywalker how to use a lightsaber without using his eyes

110
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,119
The blast shield down I can't even see in the first few runs people made the same mistake they did in the simile

111
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
Essentially they were told to change lanes

112
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,751
And they move the steering wheel in such a way that they turned a corner instead

113
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,311
Here's where things get really interesting

114
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Straight Talk

115
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:44,063
People gradually started to improve and by the end of the real world blind trial

116
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
They were performing

117
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Almost

118
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Perfect

119
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,159
Laying chickens

120
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
In my experience there's no such thing as luck

121
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
When you driving

122
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,239
Open Shazam

123
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Information

124
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
Is the vestibular system

125
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,663
Senses your balance or the somatosensory

126
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
Census

127
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,343
Pressure on your skin as your thigh presses into the seat as you turn the corner

128
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,903
Correct it

129
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,463
Using all those extra senses

130
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,023
People learn how to perform the lane change

131
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
In a real car

132
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
Blindfolded

133
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
But here's the crazy part

134
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
After it was over they asked the participants to

135
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,287
Mime a lane change with an imaginary steering wheel in their hands

136
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
And sure enough

137
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:42,175
They went right back to making the same mistake performing at corner turn in

138
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
Instead of a lane change

139
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,015
Just a ride bus this

140
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
Acerewards

141
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
Somebody

142
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
Steering wheel is

143
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
Pretty nice clean map

144
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,743
To our intuition but it still requires the

145
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Why does spit up

146
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
Feedback to that our brain knows how to use it

147
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
Also I can't stress this enough people

148
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
Don't drop my phone

149
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
Really you just you're not going to go do it

150

Here's an interesting side note if you want people to pretend to perform of perfect Lane change blindfolded years

159
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
You tell them you say

160
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
Not an obstacle in the road

161
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
And then return back

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

166
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
The body genius is a dark

167
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
Comic mystery

168
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,559
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

169
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
We're looking the part

170
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
Might cost you your life

171
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:14,751
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

172
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,103
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

173
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,431
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

174
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Adad

175
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,807
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

176
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:34,207
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing if you

177
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,839
Two days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

178
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,167
Was found dead in my private gym

179
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:49,567
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had some

180
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,871
Nothing to do with it now

181
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,919
I need to clear my name

182
00:09:54,175 --> 00:10:00,319
