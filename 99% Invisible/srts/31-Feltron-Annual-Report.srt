00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,744
I just want to know every single place that I go Nicholas Felton AKA Beltran

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,144
That he would interrogate at the end of the year designing pie charts and bar graphs are used to create a can

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,544
Insights infographic that tells the story of Nicholas Felton year is it going to be through the lens of like my favorite 80s

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,384
And more is going to be through the person I spend the most time with

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
With one person

33
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
What do you think

34
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,600
He calls the beautifully designed result the feltron annual report

35
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
About this report that is the voice of freelance journalist Nate Berg he interviewed Felton in New York for

36
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
Easy to understand in the sort of graphs and pie charts that we've gotten used to seeing all over the place but

37
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
Presenting stuff directly got out of my own life to

38
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:57,408
Restaurants I go to last year how many beers did I drink

39
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,504
These are all things that I do and I'm the data ability to

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Presented

41
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,576
Help Scott a connection between two

42
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:11,232
Essentially strangers all the easy dismissal criticisms about Foursquare check-ins and Twitter should be pop

43
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:17,632
Walking into your mind right now they all boil down to this why do I care about what you have

44
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
For breakfast this morning

45
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
And I get that

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,752
But if anything happens when you take

47
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
What you had for breakfast this morning and * 100 of its quotidian equivalent and multiply that

48
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
* 365

49
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,088
He's doing exactly what everyone else is doing but he's just doing it no more purposeful way it's not only

50
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
That he wants to track what's happening and come

51
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:46,048
See how his life changes over time but presented in a way that's digestible to himself and

52
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:52,448
Other people of even strangers what Nicholas Felton creates with all that sprawling information superficially resembles a

53
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:58,848
Corporate quarterly report but it's the most beautiful version of that you can possibly imagine true work

54
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,664
Consecutive exclamation marks use

55
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,480
2008 was pretty boring year

56
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,576
Travel very much of the highlights were like first ice cream of the year

57
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
But

58
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
Elaborate

59
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,440
Peter design work but took weeks to create

60
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:19,327
Thousands of dollars to produce to document this like one tiny memory that would have been totally lost otherwise.

61
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
It's my favorite way of telling stories now it's a

62
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,215
Way of making things that are

63
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
You are invisible

64
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
Or too large

65
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
To be comprehended

66
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
Making them visible

67
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,407
Rather than the abstractions

68
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
Looking at tables of numbers

69
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
They're pretty

70
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
Compelling and memorable ways

71
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
Revealing

72
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
Invisible stories

73
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
It puts more focus on the the little things that make up most of your time your life isn't really that trip that you took last summer

74
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:55,935
Countable times that you can walk down the same way to get your office at one house on the corner of

75
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:02,079
What that crazy dog you know how many hours of your life that you spent listen to Hotel California on the radio

76
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,919
I have to break in here to say this is where a normal public radio show with

77
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
Play the song Hotel California

78
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,271
I am your friend

79
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
And I would never

80
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
Do that to you

81
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,439
That's the beauty of this kind of representation as you can take something and represent

82
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
Millions or even

83
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
Billions of action

84
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Reduce it to

85
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Something

86
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
Consumable

87
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
Verde zero

88
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
Average beers per day

89
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447

91
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,407
Dalton has been doing this in-depth self-reporting since 2005 but the end of 2010

92
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
His father died

93
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,015
Answer the 2010 annual report took on a whole new scope

94
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,087
He took kind of that same approach but applied it

95
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,903
You know on a much grander scale to

96
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
Someone's entire life

97
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
The life of his father

2010 feltron app

99
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,327
Report I didn't want

100
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
My 2010 report to be

101
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
The story of my father's death

102
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,959
I think his death is the least in

103
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
His life story

104
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543

107
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
So

108
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,687
I wanted to make something that talked about his life

109
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
Passport stamps

110
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,759
239

111
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
It's like writing a biography about someone

112
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
A different format

113
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,463

The facts

116
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,327
Life is like a direct translation is very little

117
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
Very little my opinion

18%

131
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
It's his life story so

132
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
Bookended by his birthday

133
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695
Sadly by his death but

134
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,047
One of the things I want to remember about him and I think it's

135
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,375
Part of his story is

136
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
That's the day he died

137
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
What the weather was like

138
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Is the next

139
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Statistic

140
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
Not trying to be shocking about it

141
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
But it needs to be in there

142
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
Want to have a little

143
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Repose

144
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
At the end

145
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Absorb

146
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,367
The end of his narrative

147
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Last day

148
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
September 12th

149
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
2010

150
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
I didn't want to dwell on

151
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,303
Sickness or

152
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:36,959
That his Spirit fading I think that's in there if you look at a lot of the grass you can see

153
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
A decline in in meals out its

154
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,591
It's kind of foreshadowed throughout the document that

155
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
The spring in his step

156
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
Miss diminished in his last few years

157
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,991
My challenge was to trying

158
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
Take that idea of a biography

159
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
Put it in a new

160
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
A new form that I hadn't seen before

161
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,743
And yeah but you have to give up on

162
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
Not seeing him

163
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:06,399
Smile if not seen him in motion not hearing his voice or just listening to one of his joke

164
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
But

165
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,543
That's part of the aggregate view that's part of this

166
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,615
Is grander scope that I was going for

167
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:24,575
Weather on September 12th 2010 49.8 degrees Fahrenheit and overcast

168

Everyone it's Roman Mars again I just wanted to welcome a bunch of new people at the 99th percentile because

177
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:57,759
ITunes has been featuring the show on the big banner in the iTunes podcast or so thanks to them

178
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,831
And they were so great I think we've got a bunch of new people

179
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:05,951

Summer better than others but they're all pretty good and

184
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
Thrall will call Evergreen in the radio business so

185
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:27,199
They're not paid any certain day that information isn't too older doesn't get deprecated very fast

186
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247

I want to thank all the folks who've already done iTunes reviews I put a call out for these and we got

189
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,767
Cons of them hit allies in Lee close to getting 300 ratings and reviews

190
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,887
Which I'm really psyched for and you wouldn't believe how much they out they just they help

191
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:51,263
Tremendously in it's just very very kind and very sweet and people were running very very nice things

201
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:35,551
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

202
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,111
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

203
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,695
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

204
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975
We're looking the part

205
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:49,375
Might cost you your life you know that sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked to play superhero in

206
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:54,239
Any movie or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

207
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,591
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

208
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:05,247
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff actually if I'm being honest

209
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,647
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing a few days ago Wesley Stern

210
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:18,047
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop was found dead in my private gym

211
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:24,447
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I

212
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,007
Had something to do with it now

213
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
I need to clear my name somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do what

214
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
Whatever it takes to find them

215
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:42,367
Final episode of the body genius drops on May 30th Bend all 5 parts

216
