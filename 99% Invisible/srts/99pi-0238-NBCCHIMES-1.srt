I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,520
Sound design is one of the more overlooked asp

26
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,848
It's so critical to our enjoyment of the world

27
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,920
Do you sound pleased me more than the satisfying

28
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
That my car doors make

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,528
I get inside my VW

30
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,160
My current least favorite sounds are from credit card chip readers that Blair and I'm noxious Morning Buzz

31
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,000
Play clearly signals to normal humans that something has gone wrong

32
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,816
Even though it actually means everything went right

33
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,608
It's time to remove your card

34
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
Hahaha

35
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,728
My love of sound and story is why I was excited to find a new podcast

36
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
Twenty thousand Hertz

37
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,592
Tells the stories behind the most recognizable and interesting sounds

38
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,152
And I'm pleased for that one of their episodes today

39
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,064
Heroes Dallas Taylor tells the story behind them

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
Famous sound in Bronx

41
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
This is the national

42
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
Broadcasting Company

43
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
For being only three tiny notes the NBC Chimes of had a colossal impact on media and culture for nearly

44
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
90 years

45
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:28,992
It was back in the late 1920s when NBC started using this for the first time to identify itself on the radio

46
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,672
WEA F New York

47
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:43,840
They became so iconic and so popular that they were the very first sound to ever be awarded a Nadia trademark

48
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,632
And that's hard to get

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Take for example the Harley-Davidson engine sound

50
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:55,104
After six years of litigation and challenges from other companies they withdrew their application

51
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,432
Courts also denied Motorola's request to trade markets

52
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Chirp

53
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
Saying that among other things

54
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,576
They didn't do a good enough job promoting it as an actual sound mark

55
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:09,952
Budweiser even tried to trademark the sound of an opening beer can

56
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
I think I'm going to go to the courts on this one

57
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
So

58
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,216
They're only about a hundred sounds that I've actually officially become us trademarks

59
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,776
And most of them are incredibly iconic

60
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Ho ho ho

61
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
You got mail

62
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,880
The concept of the trademark is that it's something that's generally accepted

63
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
That can't be confused with something else

64
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,512
That you can make the case represents your Prada

65
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
That's Rick greenhut

66
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:52,192
Used to work for NBC and was actually the last person to ever officially play the Chimes on the NBC radio network

67
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,264
An audio trademark that doesn't have any lyrics in it

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
It's very hard to say will this represents my Prada

69
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,152
And the reason NBC could actually trademark that

70
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432
Is they been doing it

71
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,248
For 40 years before anybody thought to trade market

72
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:10,368
Today whenever you think about branding you think about the visual Mark the visual logo

73
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:14,976
The back in the 1920s the most powerful form of mass communication was the radio

74
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,303
The only way you could brand yourself would be through sound

75
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:23,935
Everybody heard that in the 50s or 60s would instantly know it was NBC

76
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:29,311
The Chimes were everywhere they were so popular that they even appeared in some pop songs

77
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,343
This is announcers Blues recorded in 1936 by Paul Whiteman and his orchestra

78
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
The artist behind this next track NBC I love you remains a broadcasting mystery

79
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,103
To understand where the Chimes came from we have to go back nearly a century

80
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,759
Stations were using Chimes gonz all kinds of different musical devices to

81
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,319
To create a sound signature for themselves

82
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
This is John Schneider

83
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
A radio historian

84
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,207
Chimes in particular would have been an easy choice

85
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
Due to how common they were

86
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
Dinner times were often used to summon guest to the table and it was also used to indicate the start-and-stop of intermission

87
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
NBC created a

88
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,759
7 note sequence in the idea was that at the end of each program the announcer is that the microphone

89
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:46,367
Who sang this is the National Broadcasting Company would strike a 7 note

90
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:51,487
Chime sequence on a set of hand chimes that he held next to the microphone

91
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,215
As you could imagine since this is being played live by the announcer

92
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
It was really hard to keep him

93
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
So they shortened it

94
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
3 notes

95
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,639
Originally the three notes were caf

96
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,783
Which had the same sound that we noted a chest in a different key

97
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,087
Eventually they use the notes

98
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
Gec

99
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,999
Would some people think stood for the General Electric Company

100
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,143
That would have been the coolest branding story having the gec chime stand for the General Electric Company

101
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:34,751
But the truth is General Electric didn't have much to do with NBC until later

102
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
Eventually because

103
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:42,687
It still wasn't being done uniformly on the hand chimes they went to an electronic device

104
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,343
I remember getting a tour of the technical facility

105
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,647
That's right green hat again it was the

106
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
Strange thing back in the rack

107
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
I said what's that they said

108
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
It's a Chimes machine

109
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
NBC hired an electronic Oregon Pioneer Captain Richard Wrangler to build more of an automated system for playing the show

110
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Chimes

111
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:13,919
Not only did the Chimes server branding purpose but it also solved a really big technical challenge

112
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
When they would change Studios

113
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,551
They would be literally plugging and unplugging these patch cord

114
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,367
And it would make kind of clicks and pops on the air

115
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,183
Since we end each show with the Chimes

116
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,535
Each Studio would have a take control button and a chimes

117
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:36,703
When you push the x button it would take that studio off the air under the sound of the Chimes

118
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
I didn't hear the click

119
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:48,479
Aside from its iconic cultural status the NBC Chimes also played a really important role in history

120
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:53,855
Outside of radio the only other form of mass communication was through newspaper

121
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,671
There was no medium that

122
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,511
Past news or information or entertainment to the public

123
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
In real time

124
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
Again John Schneider

125
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,655
And all of the people who were Pioneers they had to invent

126
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
Techniques that we take for granted today

127
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
It must have been

128
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,567
Fascinating time to participate in birth

129
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,615
Modern Electronic media

130
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,319
One of radio's most important moments came during World War II

131
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:30,975
For the first time in history news from the front lines of War can become available to the Mass public in near real-time

132
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,815
Radiohead discovered its importance

133
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,399
As a news medium and not just an entertainment medium

134
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:45,055
During the war NBC at 1/4 time to covertly notify announcers that important breaking news with eminent

135
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,871
If the normal chime was gec

136
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,223
At the end of a program they would buy the chime gec

137
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
See

138
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,855
National Broadcasting Company will continue its network service throughout the remainder of the night

139
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,695
And you will be important but so far unconfirmed reports from overseas

140
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
This is vernacular Broadcasting Company

141
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
That fourth note

142
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,495
Which probably most of the radio audience

143
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Never even noticed

144
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:22,175
Was a cue to the radio stations pay attention listen on the line between the program and be prepared

145
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,735
For something momentous to come along

146
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,319
When it rains all of us at NBC spring into action

147
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Wherever we may be

148
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
The Points Guy means to us

149
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
Call the office

150
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
You're down here big things are happening

151
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
During the invasion of D-Day NBC fourth time with played alongside the morse code sound for the letter v

152
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,191
Indicating that The Invasion had just begun

153
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,031
The time the fourth time means news of the greatest World Imports

154
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,591
The first time riding on D-Day

155
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,431
The fourth time will ring again on v-day the Day of Victory

156
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:00,319
Thankfully the fourth time was only played a handful of times in the history of the network

157
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
NBC was huge

158
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,839
All the other networks were still up and coming so NBC commanded all the top talent

159
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,567
We bring you a man who paddled here all the way from Hollywood

160
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:30,783
People who are getting the ratings in the people were the next day's water cooler conversation

161
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,111
That would be the radio show from NBC the night before

162
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,695
So NBC to me always had seemed like

163
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
The Cadillac brand

164
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,535
It was a brand whose name you remember

165
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
Whose logo you could picture

166
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,703
And when you heard the sound to picture the logo when you saw the logo you heard the sound in your mind

167
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
The NBC chimes

168
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,919
At least on the radio came to a close in the late 1980s

169
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,015
When Rick greenhut played them for the last time on the 9 News

170
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,855
We typically which I'm out of every Network feed we did

171
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,903
And it about 8:45

172
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,743
The newscasters already in the booth the producer sitting next to me

173
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,327
I've got the commercials in the machines for each of the time zone

174
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
And the general manager comes up

175
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:23,263
And he said I wanted you to be the first to know that the radio network has been sold

176
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,663
General Electric acquired NBC radio through the purchase of RCA this meant that NBC radio no longer

177
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,455
Operated as its own entity

178
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
The NBC Chimes were not

179
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
Part of the sale

180
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,135
Because they're the NBC chimes in the TV network is keeping those

181
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:46,047
9 hour comes we do the network News gas and it 905 30 the news

182
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,863
News caster says Doreen on NBC News New York

183
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
I played the Chimes

184
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,799
I then pulled that tape cartridge out of the machine where I played it well no sooner at

185
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
General manager shows up

186
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:05,503
And he just looked at me and he said make sure no one else can do that I did that by taking it

187
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
At the cartridge home and it's sitting on my shelf

188
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,927
The NBC radio network came to a close

189
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:18,303
But obviously the Chimes still live on through promos and special programming and news

190
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:22,399
But the sound is bigger than Comcast or NBC or General Electric

191
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:27,263
It's something that's deeply embedded and weave through our history for the good

192
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
Did the bad

This sound has been with us for almost ninety years

195
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,183
It started as a sound that just fixed a small problem

196
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
But

197
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,839
Has become something that's completely ingrained in our culture

Bongs and chatter of our devices

211
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,479
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound
