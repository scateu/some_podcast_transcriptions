Designs

46
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
From Douglas Adams The Long Dark tea-time of the Soul

47
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,920
I think so many airports

48
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
We're not designed for the

49
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
And so

50
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,624
It is all fixing as you go there if there wasn't some great mask

51
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:42,048
So when it comes to the ugliness in general dysfunction of airports are a little bit off.

52
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
Improvement

53
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:49,216
An area of about the design of air

54
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
Airport she said to me

55
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:56,128
If all airports simply play Brian Eno's album music for airports over the speakers

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,432
Every airport would be better

57
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,480
My name is Alison Arias

58
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
And I read about design and

59
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Annabelle

60
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
The New York Times

61
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
I say this to serve not only as an introduction to Allison area but also so that you'll know that she is someone

62
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
Who is Judgement

63
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
Is perfectly true

64
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,096
Antarctic Iceberg to said nothing is

65
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,656
More quickly obsolete than an airport built

66
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,936
Technology

67
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
Changing so fast

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,872
Anything at all airports are still trying to catch up to now the thing that forced airports to change the most

69
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
The fastest

70
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
Was 9/11

71
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,528
Security screen has come to dominate all aspects of airport design

72
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,320
We're going to focus on just too fat

73
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:43,232
The verses that because the unpredictability and time required to go through security you no longer dawdle on what is called the land

74
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:48,608
And side of the airport landside is basically a curb appeal part of the airport parking in store

75
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:55,008
Ticketing area so considered landside the wonderful lines that you have to wait in TSA

76
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
Play what you're also changing by the way most airports of course have had to make room for those lines so all of that in landside

77
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:07,808
So when do you want yourself to the pleasant experience that is security you are on the airside but people responsible for Bill

78
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
Airports

79
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,880
Really kind of followed the bus station model

80
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Where

81
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
It was like a holding pen

82
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:19,839
We just got you here as long as we put you on Amtrak or put you on Greyhound and airports were so tough on that model T because he asked

83
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
Assumption was you were just passing through

84
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:28,031
Now the assumption is that you are absolutely not just passing through the assumption is that you were going to be staying

85
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
A while

86
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
So newer airports are designed with that in mind

87
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:38,271
And a good example of this new thinking described in a recent New York Times article by area

88
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,367
Is the new T2 terminal design by Gensler Architects at Sanford

89
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
Cusco International airport

90
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,695
T2 is the new

91
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Terminal 5

92
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,999
American Airlines

93
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
And Virgin America

94
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
At Sanford

95
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
Beijing International Airport

96
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
And it's one of the

97
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
The first

98
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
Terminal

99
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
To be designed

100
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
911

101
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,311
The last terminal constructed the 42 at SFO

102
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,639
Was the international terminal that opened in December of two

103
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
It still feels pretty new

104
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
But you can tell right away

105
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,855
The trajectory of airport is on was going in a very different direction in the year 2000

106
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,207
Then what is prioritize today San Francisco International Terminal for example

107
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
Is all about

108
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
Ticketing area you walking answers

109
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
Massive

110
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:27,167
Amount of space it's open and Airy and actually pretty wonderful to experience but

111
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,215
In the new world of TSA

112
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,263
All that building doesn't make any sense

113
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
If you actually

114
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
Think about it you realize that

115
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,663
All the exciting stuff is on the land side

116
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,223
Eating your shopping apps that are all that

117
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,319
In the new T2 all the good stuff is saved

118
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,135
Security because as we all know everyone should

119
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
Russian today

120
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
I'm going to want to leave her at all

121
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,743
So while there is a very generous

122
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
Ticketing area

123
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
Did you giving way more

124
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
1000 mm

125
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Coming to the gate

126
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:07,615
What's also different about T2 is that they're really incorporating the security procedures in the design from the get-go

127
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,711
When you look at security Now it often looks like the TSA

128
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,759
Just set up shop yesterday

129
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,855
With retractable barriers and then it spits you out to a couple of folding chairs

130
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
To put on your shoes in

131
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
Stole your laptop

132
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,999
The new T2 actually has what they call a recompose own which is

133
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,839
Like a lounge for putting your clothes back on after you get through TSA with

134
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,375
Sculpture in

135
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
Lots of natural light in sky lights

136
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,519
And once you are at that spot putting your shoes in your bowel phone

137
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
Jewelry my Roth back on

138
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
You can see everything that you're about

139
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Retail

140
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Seton Hall

141
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:50,623
I've never given much thought to shops or restaurants in airports but the thing I need not want

142
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,951
I need when I travel is a place to plug in my phone

143
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
Or laptop

144
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
And probably both

145
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:01,887
There are many many more Banks about let's cuz again you think even back to

146
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
Pre 9-11 which is now

147
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
About 10 years ago

148
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
Ubiquity of person

149
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
The walkmen

150
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
Great path music

151
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
At every age every soda

152
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Traveling segmen

153
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Worse

154
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
Airports.

155
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
I was in O'Hare recently

156
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
Sitting on the floor next to this businessman

157
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
We were huddled like hobos around

158
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
Single outlet in this 3 gate area

159
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:33,375
According to area human factors study shows that passengers want to stay within 250 feet of their gay

160
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,703
Gate and T2 at SFO addresses this anxiety

161
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
If your

162
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
Find a paper

163
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
Traveller coffee sitting down the restaurant

164
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,895
All the gates are visible all the time because of the open floor plan

165
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,711
What I heard a lot and talking to many many arcs

166
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Express Airport

167
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
The top of the list

168
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
Letting people feel like

169
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
Hello there experience

170
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
I'm having a son

171
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Where they're going and

172
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,767
Really should have designing so that all of the anxiety that comes naturally with that hoe

173
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
Process now is is alleviated

174
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
What is 6 * 10

175
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655

179
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,199
The noble goal is to try to design away all airport anxieties no matter how experienced The Traveler

180
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,087
Bruno's in 10 years I could be redoing the story and contrasting T2 against some new super Airport

181
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,927
That solves all the problems of usage that T2 failed to anticipate

182
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,231
No place to park my jetpack

183
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,815
