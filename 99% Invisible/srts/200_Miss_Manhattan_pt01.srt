As we are approaching on a 300th episode of the show The 99 guy crew took a couple days to go on a retreat at the coast

Listen to audio that inspires us and talk about the future of the show

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,096
Because of all the time it took to plan and execute the retreat

35
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
We have one of our rare rebroadcast this week and I'm happy to Revisited because this is a pivotal episode 4

36
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,312
9% invisible and one of my personal favorites

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,688
It was a really ambitious story for Avery at the time and we knew it was going to be important so

38
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,504
We commissioned an original score for the first time

39
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784

You're in for a real treat

42
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
Did you have

43
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,608
You should listen again because I think it gets better each time I stay to the end because we have a brand new interview with Sean that I

44
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,424
Conducted late last night on the foggy California coast

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,776
About the score for this episode in the process of composing music for nerds

46
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
To talk over

47
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
Here we go

48
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
This is 99% invisible

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,944
I'm Roman Mars

50
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,624
All over New York City there are so many clothes or nude women

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,208
And they are so baked in architecture that we don't even see them

52
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:45,120
For example when you enter the New York Public Library on the left hand side there's a sculpture of a young woman leaning against a horse

53
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
On 59th and 5th

54
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,216
There's a statue of a woman holding a basket

55
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,568
107th Street and Broadway there's a woman reclining on a bed

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,128
That's former New Yorker Avery trufelman

57
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
100th and Riverside Drive

58
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
A stone woman sits

59
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,992
In a chair with a child

60
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,064
Very top of the New York Municipal Building

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,112
There's a golden woman holding a

62
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
Crown

63
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
And these women

64
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
Or actually

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
The same woman

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
Audrey Munson

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
Was the most famous artist model

68
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
In the United States

69
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
Over 30 statues at the Met are made in her likeness and she adores it doesn't the memorials and bridges and Regal

70
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,824
Buildings all over New York City

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,408
She basically was the equivalent of a supermodel at the time

72
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
This is Andrea Geyer

73
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,760
An artist herself and author of Queen of the artists studio

74
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
The story of Audrey Munson

75
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,392
Everybody knew who she was her picture was in the papers

76
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:44,000
And if one trust Legends I call every boy had a crush on her

77
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
She was a very desired

78
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
A young woman

79
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
In her lifetime

80
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,960
She would go on to decorate buildings and memorials all over the United States

81
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
Before becoming a movie star

82
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,848
And eventually getting embroiled in a sensational murder scandal

83
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,968
And although Audrey Munson's body has been immortalized in the iron and marble

84
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
Her name is mostly forgotten

85
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:11,136
But she was a prolific writer and pandas series of Articles telling her life in her own words

86
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
Sometimes and the third person

87
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
Where is she now

88
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
This model who was so beautiful

89
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
What has been her reward

90
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
Is she happy and prosperous

91
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,423
Arshi sad and forlorn

92
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
Her beauty gone

93
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
Leaving only memories in the way

94
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,615
Like so many supermodels that would come after her

95
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,943
Audrey Marie Munson was scouted on the streets of New York City

96
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
In 1906

97
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,903
Audrey's mother and father were divorced which was very unusual at the time and her mother decided to get a fresh start in the big sick

98
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
Audrey was 15

99
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
Enrolled in music school and one day

100
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,583
She was picked up on the street by a photographer

101
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,727
When she walked around with her mother this photographer gave Audrey his card and asked if she would pose for some portraits

102
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,799
Her mom was invited to so intentions were good

103
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
These photos were

104
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
Fully clothed

105
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:08,735
Audrey by chance was picked up as a model and then in the studio

106
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
Proof that she was somebody

107
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:15,391
Who was very good with the camera very good in creating a generating poses

108
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,255
Best photographer recommended that Audrey meet a friend of his the famous sculptor Isidore Conte

109
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,071
At first, he thought he didn't really need Audrey

110
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,143
But as Audrey herself later recalled

111
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:30,495
Suddenly he rose from the table walked about me asked me to stand and walk

112
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
And then said that he thought he could use me

113
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
Fedmyster Conte

114
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,895
You will have to pose in the altogether

115
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
Posing in the altogether mint posing naked

116
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
Audrey's mother consented

117
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:48,159
If they would have been wealthy people I don't think her mother would have let her pose in the nude

118
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,975
From that encounter the resulting sculpture was

119
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
The three muses

120
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
Three nude women with their arms around each

121
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
All three

122
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Model

123
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Dr. Audrey

124
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,447
For decades the sculpture was in the lobby of the hotel Astor

125
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,751
Audrey called this statue quote

126
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,055
A souvenir of my mother's consent

127
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,151
And this was the first of many sculptures that you would model for his Door County

128
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,735
Audrey began to work for many other famous artists in New York

129
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,575
As a reputation grew choose recommended from Studio 2

130
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
Studio and slowly

131
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,439
Her likeness appeared mostly naked or half-naked

132
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
All over the city

133
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
1913

134
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,583
The New York Sun dubbed her Miss Manhattan

135
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
But Audrey is not always recognizable in sculpture

136
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,471
Her figure is different in different artist eyes

137
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
Sometimes she's lying

138
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Sometimes she's Fuller

139
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,663
In sculpture the sculpture there are no obvious giveaway is that you're looking at Audrey's body

140
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
The clues are in her face

141
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Expressions

142
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,063
Of the eyes and the mouth into nose

143
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,391
Like once you know how she looks you can see her everywhere

144
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,487
It's really fascinating I would like look at sculptures in the moment and be like

145
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,815
That looks like her and then research and be

146
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,607
Yeah be right that was her

147
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,679
Before it was easy for artists to snap a reference picture

148
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,263
Audrey could pose in a way that could invoke a mood

149
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,847
She must have been a very empathetic person she could really

150
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
Translate emotion

151
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,175
Fully into her body

152
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,783
Battery can hold the same pose for hours sometimes for an entire day

153
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
And she worked closely with the artist

154
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
Learning their temperament

155
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
Familiarizing yourself with their past work

156
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,463
She thought of herself as a collaborator

157
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
That she told the New York Herald in 1915

158
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Study

159
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
Yes indeed I do

160
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
Every model who is a realtor

161
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
Success must study the work

162
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
What is a person

163
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
Cheese with

164
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,495
Audrey's unique set of skills earned her a decent salary

165
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
About $35 a week

166
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,591
Which today would be like $800 a week

167
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,175
She made enough to give a day's salary to the suffragist movement

168
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223
Which was in full swing around her

169
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
Audrey with an independent

170
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
Confident Woman

171
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
Had a good time to be a

172
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:59,999
Because the architecture that was in Vogue in the United States from the end of the 19th century through World War

173
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
Was the Bozart Style

174
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,423
And this style required a lot of sculptures and detailed ornamentation

175
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
A great time in many ways

176
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
To be an artist

177
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,799
This is architectural historian Karen McNeil

178
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,615
Whether you an architect sculptor A Painter

179
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,407
Across person making lamps

180
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
Using Bozart style architecture

181
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,015
Virtually all state capitals are in this style

182
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
That image of an authoritative building with

183
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,647
Columns and statues all around maybe a big dome

184
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,231
That's bosarts the style is a cross between like

185
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:35,583
Stately Greek Parthenon and Flowery French Versailles

186
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
So a Bazaar building

187
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:43,263
It's a greek temple but then you do have the sculptures on it you do have the freeze work you do have all of this

188
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,127
Ornamental detail that is integral to the building and architecture and sculpture

189
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,431
Are we bound together in this movement

190
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,015
When you take a decorative elements off of a bozar building

191
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,879
It started looking weird the dimensions don't quite work anymore

192
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,951
Also the sculptures are signs of the buildings purple

193
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
The very overly representational

194
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,095
Like in a private home the statues are of domestic scenes

195
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,911
Sore on a market there of harvest and eating

196
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
Are government buildings

197
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,103
Say San Francisco City Hall it's all going to tell us about this is the seat of government in California so great

198
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
Fabulous and

199
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
But it's all going to be allegorical

200
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:26,015
In a government building you might find a statue of a woman holding an olive branch

201
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
Or the scales of Justice

202
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
Representing the state liberty

203
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Truth

204
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,439
You name it just women placed on this

205
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
Pedestal

206
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
Virtue

207
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
Morality

208
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,327
Motherhood nurturing

209
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
Strength

210
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,143
Women decorated the seat of power

211
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
They didn't say that

212
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Why's it gotta be a lady

213
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
Because women are pure

214
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,543
You know a woman with a spear

215
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
She would only use that

216
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
Spirit to really defend her kids

217
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Right so it has two

218
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:00,319
And for several years is pure uncorrupt symbol of virtue in the US

219
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
Was Audrey Munson

220
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
She was everywhere

221
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
The World's Fair in 1915 held in San Francisco

222
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,791
Audrey posed for 3/4 the statues on the premises

223
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
Her face and body

224
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Appeared

225
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
Everywhere throughout the grounds

226
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,215
What's Aaron Garcia of the California Historical Society

227
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:22,847
She curated an exhibit about the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition in San Francisco

228
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,895
Where Audrey Munson was dubbed

229
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
The exposition girl

230
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:32,831
In a court of Four Seasons she was the seasons of the Fountain of energy

231
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:39,231
She was the Priestess of culture at the Palace of Fine Arts she posed for 91 figures meant to represent

232
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
At the stars

233
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
She was all over the place

234
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,863
What about 24 years old Miss Manhattan had won the West

235
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,167
And there was a new form of RN during the scene

236
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
Cinema

237
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,519
The obvious next stop for Audrey Munson was Hollywood

238
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
And Hollywood was

239
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
Unfortunately

240
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
The beginning of the end

241
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Probably monsters

242
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:01,503
Cheers cast in a few films after the exposition but in every case she has cast

243
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
As a nude model

244
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,623
As an artist model and she appears nude

245
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,975
Body was actually the first leading woman in Hollywood to appear naked on film

246
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
Audrey may have been a good model

247
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
But she honestly wasn't much of an actress

248
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,423
If you've heard films she actually had an acting double

249
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
To basically do everything except the naked posing

250
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:27,103
In the movies and end up really being worth it for her financially she was paid very little

251
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,175
And none of them seem to have been critical successes

252
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,551
That might have been okay for her her career might have survived.

253
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,879
But then unfortunately she was involved in a murder

254
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,463
Scandal Audrey and her mother had an apartment in New York

255
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
The landlord doctor Wilkins

256
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:49,631
Fell in love with Audrey her landlord apparently became obsessed with her

257
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
And

258
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
Killed his wife

259
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
So that he could be with Audrey

260
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
Romance with Doctor Wilkins

261
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,943
She and her mother had actually moved out of the

262
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,759
Before this happened

263
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:11,903
But they were questioned they had to testify in court and they were sort of dragged through the mud in the Press

264
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,999
The so-called Wilkins case became a phenomenal media scandal

265
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,071
As Audrey told the daily Variety in 1920

266
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
The Wilkins case ruined my career

267
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
I'll never count for anything again

268
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,519
I'm loving and admiring me the public seems to have grown to hate me

269
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
Audrey couldn't find any work

270
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,711
In Fillmore in artist Studios for the decline of Audrey career wasn't just because of the Wilkins scandal

271
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
She was after all

272
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
Totally innocent

273
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,855
Noticed a lot of factors changing in the culture around her

274
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:48,511
I want the Bozart style wasn't very popular anymore the Bozart style came out of Europe

275
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,327
And there is this thing called World War 1

276
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
Where Western Europe kind of fell apart

277
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
And so there was a questioning

278
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
About whether or not

279
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
We want to be using

280
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
That kind of symbolism

281
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,639
Both European and American Architects were trending towards modernism

282
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,199
Away from the old world bosarts presidents

283
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,527
Also the economics of Bozart style wearing possible

284
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,087
It became increasingly expensive

285
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:19,487
To construct these buildings and pay for all of the artists and Artisans to design all of the elements of

286
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,023
The building and install it

287
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,351
The architectural world didn't need Audrey like it used to

288
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,751
And also at 30 she was aging out of the business career as an artist

289
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,311
Come to an end and her money starting to run out

290
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
She moves Upstate with her mother

291
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,455
You clean homes to support them both as they tried to carve out a place for themselves

292
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
In the small rural town

293
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
Of Mexico New York

294
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
It's not an

295
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,879
Kind of open easy going

296
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:53,023
Andrea Geyer went up there to talk to people about Audrey nobody was unfriendly to me but

297
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
There's something

298
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,399
About these close-knit Community Square as a stranger you don't

299
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
Feel welcomed

300
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,239
Audrey could not get used

301
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
It's a Small Town life

302
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,335
Her whole adulthood she been traveling around the country

303
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Studying art

304
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,175
Working with artist engaging in intellectual discussion

305
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
And wearing fine clothes

306
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
Suddenly she lost it all

307
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
Well she still had the clothes

308
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,111
People told me that she

309
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
Very flamboyant

310
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
She

311
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
Like to

312
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:26,303
Dress up and colorful garments I mean I'm sure she had a pretty

313
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,095
Impressive wardrobes

314
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:34,495
Was very outlandish for a small community but it wasn't just Audrey style that set her up

315
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,567
She would dress up on that and then part of her

316
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:43,967
Workout routine in the city was roller skating so you know you can imagine a beautiful woman with

317
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,271
Long hair and a turban on her head

318
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,087
You know trying to roller skate on a country

319
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
Unpaved Country Road Douglas

320
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
Quite a scene

321
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,255
The town new Audrey as that crazy woman who used to get naked for money

322
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,839
Parents would close their Windows whenever she came roller skating by

323
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,655
The kids of course were totally fascinated with her

324
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,263
But there was a general consensus that she was crazy

325
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
Just because she was differ

326
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,383
So it's not hard to imagine why she

327
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,943
Would have fallen into a depression

328
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,551
And on May 27th 1922 Audrey Munson attempted suicide

329
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
By swallowing poison

330
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
I don't know how

331
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,207
Committed her suicide attempt was

332
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,559
Maybe it was just an expression of being some her at the end of her line

333
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
After her failed suicide attempt

334
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,887
Several years went by

335
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,727
And Audrey's mother was struggling to provide for her depressed daughter

336
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
Just couldn't do it anymore

337
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,431
40th birthday June 8th 1931

338
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,247
Her mother checked her into the state mental institution

339
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,575
At that time it was extremely common for families

340
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
To put

341
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,159
Relatives into these institutions

342
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
In moments of

343
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,767
A financial hardship where they felt

344
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
They couldn't care for a person

345
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,887
Body remained in the institution into her 90s

346
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,935
Then she was put in a nursing home

347
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:14,335
30 miles up the road but this home for the elderly will situated on this little four-lane Highway

348
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
The highway with a little strip mall

349
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Which attabar

350
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
End

351
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,735
She was known

352
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
2

353
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,087
Sneak out of the home for the elderly and

354
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,647
Sneak across the four-lane highway

355
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,207
To spend her evenings at the bar

356
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,767
Ordering drinks and telling stories of

357
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
4 * as a model and isn't

358
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
They could not

359
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,679
Stop this 90 something elegant older woman

360
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,007
From running across four lanes of traffic to go to the bar

361
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,823
It sadly meant that they put her back into the mental and

362
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
Constitution worksheet

363
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,151
You know spent the rest of her life

364
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,991
Audrey Munson live just short of her 105th birthday

365
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
She died in 1996

366
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,879
This public body that once represented truth

367
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
Civic Fame memory

368
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
The universe and the Stars

369
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
But anyway

370
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
For nearly two-thirds of our life

371
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
But that 1/3

372
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
That glorious third immortalized her

373
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,703
In place or all over American cities

374
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
Perched High

375
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
Quietly out of sight

376
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
Staring down

377
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,919
I'm wondering if many of my readers have not stood before a masterpiece of lovely

378
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,735
Sculpture a remarkable painting of a young girl

379
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
And ask themselves a question

380
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
Where is she now

381
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,111
This model who was so Beauty

382
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
What has been herbivores

383
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
Is she happy and prosperous

384
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
Arshi sad and forlorn

385
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
Her beauty God

386
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,839
Leaving only memories in the way

387
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,223
An interview with 99percentinvisible composer

388
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
Sean real

389
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
But after this

390
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
Between the beats

391
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,903
Bongs and chatter of our devices

392
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,487
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

393
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
If

394
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:13,119
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

395
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:19,007
Talking to me and my wife is in another room in a kid is another remembrall hearing that voice

396
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
Technology talk to us

397
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,847
It is a creation of Sonic trap

398
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,919
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

399
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,503
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

400
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,551
To make them more human

401
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
Turn the living room lights on

402
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Okay

403
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
Dim the living room lights to 50

404
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
2%

405
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
Okay

406
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,191
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

407
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,239
Makes for a much more natural

408
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
Experience

409
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
Turn the living room lights on

410
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
Dim the living room lights

411
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
50%

412
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:04,575
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

413
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
About how are sounds gay

414
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
Is impacting our health

415
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,951
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

416
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,023
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

417
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,071
Right here on the 9th 9 p.m.

418
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,423
We need to talk about something

419
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,751
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself

420
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,591
It's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine

421
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,639
But thinking about it all the time is frustrate

422
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:34,015
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

423
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,343
And you don't know why and it may be time to seek help

424
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,671

We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

426
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Oh my God

427
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Black podcast

428
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:56,031
As I mentioned earlier Miss Manhattan was the first time we work with our composure Shawn real

429
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,335
And during our Retreat last weekend

430
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
I pulled

431
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,431
Sean out of a rousing game of Dixit

432
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,551
And ask them how that came about

433
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
I was in my car I was

434
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,391
Walking dogs as a job

435
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
And

436
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,975
She got a text from Avery that just said

437
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Would you want to come

438
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,047
Compose music for the show

439
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,887
And I like had to pull over because I was so excited it was

440
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,935
It felt like a dream come true

441
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,287
Do you remember anything specific about the music from this episode The Audrey Munson

442
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,567
Episode in particular that you were

443
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Really proud

444
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
One of the challenges I was having was

445
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,943
I really wanted

446
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,527
To get like the right textures for it because it felt

447
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,087
I felt like such a special story and it felt like

448
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
It was this architecture that was coming to life that like had life in it Audrey Munson personnel

449
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,815
Body that was like infused in the sculptures

450
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
And one of the things

451
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,191
But I felt really satisfied about

452
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
Was this one sound a guy.

453
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
When

454
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,055
I was trying to think like what is like

455
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,103
Stone and Marble and

456
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
Those kinds of things what kind of texture with

457
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
Feel

458
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,967
Representative of that and

459
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:14,879
Have this thing called the Glockenspiel it's like a little xylophone that's made of metal and it's more like a Chinese kind of a saint

460
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
Usually

461
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,976
Hit it here in a lot of indie folk bands and stuff

462
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
So I like Toca and

463
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
I'd like Dennis

464
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
Before

465
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,656
Just taking a bow like a cello bow and just seeing

466
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
What it does with

467
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
Pretty much anything

468
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
Cancel

469
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
So do you thinking of like those kinds of exercises

470
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
I took the cello bow and I

471
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
Put it on the glockenspiel

472
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
And it had a very kind of like

473
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
Coarse texture

474
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:45,088
2 Atwell still like maintaining it's like beautiful tone like it had like a very

475
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,952
Specific tone and so I like actually took two bows and I was able to like make harmonies

476
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
There's one specifically that

477
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
And the peace before the

478
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
Credits come up

479
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,400
Bap it is the screechy

480
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
Marbley Park

481
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,496
It's like probably one of the most Amorphis

482
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
Things I

483
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
Done for the show and it feels really

484
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,152
We could just think that like oh yeah that's the Audrey Munson piece that's like

485
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
The sound of Audrey Munson

486
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,672
What is the standard operating procedure for how

487
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,488
You work on the show and where you fit in

488
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
Structionsite

489
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,608
So it starts out with me talking with the producers about

490
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
The stories that they're working on

491
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Are giving me life

492
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,496
Personalities of the people they're interviewing and

493
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,592
Bigger picture ideas of what they want to convey

494
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,408
And then when there's a first draft

495
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
I'm reading it and I'm kind of like

496
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
Writing

497
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,040
Music as I'm reading it and trying to like

498
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,576
Get an idea of pacing

499
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
But

500
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
It's really hard to

501
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
Lock that in

502
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,512
And iiii so I make sketches basically but it's hard to lock in like

503
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,048
The timing and stuff

504
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
Until we have

505
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
AR

506
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
Read through edit

507
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
Where we all

508
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:08,544
Set and we read through the script and play tape and then I record that and when I have that I can actually like

509
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
Do my recording

510
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
And

511
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
Make

512
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,688
Drafts of my songs Discord

513
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
A piece with

514
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:20,576
And then from there we like make a rough mix with music with the music drafts

515
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
And everybody gets notes on that

516
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
And then from there I like

517
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,464
Make any changes

518
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,256
That we want and

519
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
Do the final mixes

520
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
The pieces

521
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Play doubt

522
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
The first time what is the most

523
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
Common teasel

524
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
That you

525
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
Get from

526
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
The producers of the show

527
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
But things are too busy

528
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
Is it

529
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
WhatsApp

530
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
I have a very

531
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
Dense sense of rhythm

532
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,576
It's just kind of the way that my head works I can't I can't do anything simply

533
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:57,952
And it's really helpful actually to sketch things out with midi because I can like

534
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
Just like

535
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,792
Do a cluster of notes

536
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:06,400
And then kind of just like go in and individually like pick this one out pick this one out pick this one out in like

537
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:12,288
Create a rhythm that like feels effectively the same but like isn't quite isn't going to be like

538
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,080
Grabbing for your attention,

539
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,640
People are talking and trying to

540
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,920
Explain

541
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
Things about working with

542
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
Musicians

543
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
Scoring is that

544
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,136
Some of the most interesting stuff that's going on the music

545
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,976
Is in the same Zone as The narrator's Voice

546
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
And you at the clinic

547
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
So that it

548
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Doesn't

549
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
Peed

550
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,144
I feel like it's a lot like being in a band like

551
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,936
It's hard to listen to music when

552
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
Everything is like

553
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,288
Really active in competing and it's just

554
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,080
I think of it like

555
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,664
Whatever is happening in the story right now is

556
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,224
Delete instrument and I'm

557
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,296
There to support it the other instruments aren't less import

558
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,344
For not being like the center of attention

559
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
It's all working together

560
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
So we're going to end

561
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
What would be

562
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
Composition

563
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Lights go out

564
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
Proud moment

565
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
From

566
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
Everything that happened from

567
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
So 200

568
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,912

Episode 300

570
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,592
Really wide spectrum the written so much music

571
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
One that I really

572
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
I feel really proud of is

573
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,272
The credits music for manzanar

574
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
It feels very

575
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
Sweet in this way that I

576
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,184
Don't always get to lock into

577
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,232
Quite quite the same way so

578
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024

That whines through a

A treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
Might cost you your life

620
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:50,400
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

621
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:54,752
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

622
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,080
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

623
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,104
A dad

624
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,456
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

625
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:07,808
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

626
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
Nothing

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

630
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,168
Even worse

631
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:26,240
The cops think that I had something to do with it

632
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,520
Now

633
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,568
I need to clear my name

634
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:35,968
