I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,984
The state of Utah has about 3 million people

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,288
And a third of them live in one Valley

25
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,824
Surrounded on three sides

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,872
By 7000 ft mountains

00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152

The valley is home to the state capitol

31
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,296
Salt Lake City

32
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,624
And a bunch of other small cities and towns that overtime

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
Have grown together into one big Mass

34
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
What are the towns amid the sprawl

35
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
Isabel

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
Okay

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,608
We are in Midvale Utah

38
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,728
Producer and the Fitzgerald recently took a trip to Midvale Utah to visit a mobile home

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,264
I am standing up

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
Side of the

41
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
Applewood community

42
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,920
Applewood is a small mobile home Community for seniors

43
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,224
You have to be 55 or older to live there

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
About seven acres

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
56 Lots

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,600
It looks a lot like the rest of suburban Midvale

47
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,416
It's at the houses are smaller and closer together

48
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
It has its own little road

49
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
With its own speed limit

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
10 miles per hour

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
The very quiet community

52
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,864
Except for that weed wacker

53
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,680
Houses are in just a few

54
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,984
A few feet apart

55
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
I'm the Bell

56
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,312
Nice to know there are in really good shape

57
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
Olive Garden. Front of you

58
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Wechat

59
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,392
Hello

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
This is Charlene stovin

61
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,816
She convinced me I needed to come visit Applewood after one phone call

62
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,888
There's something in my voice on the phone that attracts people

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,728
I can get on that phone and I'm not bragging but I can get anything I want

64
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
I don't know

65
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
Charlene's home is immaculate

66
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,896
She has spotless white carpeting from wall to wall

67
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,224
And all this modern furniture that's been carefully color

68
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
And it's really spacious

69
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320
She says that when people first walk in

70
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,136
They seem surprised that a mobile home could be so nice

71
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,696
Jose

72
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Ja

73
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:16,352
It's a manufactured home and it is built stronger and better than 90% of visual tracking

74
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,448
Books hard for people to get past this tunnel vision of

75
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
Trailers in trailer trash

76
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,080
Mobile homes don't get a lot of love in our culture

77
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,408
They represent a lot of the affordable housing in the United States

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
Drop the 90s

79
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,040
Mobile homes made up about two-thirds of new affordable housing

80
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:40,416
Charlene bought her mobile home or manufactured home in 1994

81
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,488
She was divorced for kids were grown up and out of the house

82
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
She wanted to buy her own place

83
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,096
But you couldn't afford a tract home in the suburbs

84
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,144
When I thought I was just excited to think

85
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,216
I can actually now have a beautiful home

86
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
That I can afford

87
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
Does tract homes I can afford

88
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
I had to borrow money

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,200
And the loan on the borrowing of the money plus the pet fee

90
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
Which less than what I was paying

91
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
Tarentum Park

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
But when you buy a manufactured home

93
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,648
The structure itself is only half of the equation

94
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
Then you need to find a place to put it

95
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,512
Angeline found what seems like the perfect spot

96
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,583
A small quiet mobile home park with an empty lot

97
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,935
When we moved here I moved here February 1994 thought I'd died and gone to heaven

98
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
I have a little

99
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,031
Beautiful backyard and I plan a little bit of the garden

100
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
I love tomato on my cucumber

101
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
I want just a little bit of crayons

102
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,431
And this is just enough

103
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
That's perfect

104
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
But it wasn't actually perfect

105
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,879
The same Dynamic that made this housing situation great for Shirlene

106
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
Also made her vulnerable

107
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,463
Because the mobile home was hers

108
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
The land underneath it

109
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Wasn't

110
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,863
Part of the Paradox at the heart of manufactured housing is that

111
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
Precisely the thing that makes

112
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
It's so affordable

113
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
That also makes this

114
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
Reighley NC

115
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
Secure form of housing

116
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
This is aster Sullivan

117
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,407
A sociologist at the University of Colorado Denver

118
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,479
Who studies the relationship between poverty and housing

119
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:13,087
She says that about a third of mobile home owners live in Parks like Applewood

120
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391
Where they rent a plot of land for their home

121
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:20,767
She called this Arrangement halfway home ownership because it's filled with all this uncertain

122
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,607
Residence Inn Park basically live at the whim of

123
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
The property owner

124
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,959
Where the property owner has the majority of Rights

125
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
In that community

126
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
So they are subject

127
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
Too often times

128
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
Foreign Shawty maintenance

129
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,407
Ever-increasing rents

130
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
And eventually

131
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
They can be subject to

132
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:44,063
Park closure and Redevelopment with very little notice

133
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:50,719
One Day in 2011 and found a letter we all received this letter

134
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
You're right

135
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
It's not going to

136
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
$89

137
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Per month

138
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
And in six months

139
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
It's going to go up another

140
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
$89

141
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:08,383
The owner of Apple that taking good care of the Park and Campground slow and affordable

142
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,199
But there were new owners now

143
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,063
Who can afford a TI and then another 89% unlimited account

144
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
Are you kidding

145
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,183
They managed to negotiate the increases down to $70 each

146
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
But still in a six month. The rent for each lot went from $320 to 460

147
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
And rumors started swirling

148
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,983
That the increases might just be the first step in a plan to force them out

149
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,055
Shirleen started digging into what was going on

150
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,151
And pretty soon she discovered that the new landlords had submitted a plan to the city

151
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,455
To build a 3-story apartment

152
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
Right on top of Apple

153
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
Then we understood why

154
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
They were trying to

155
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
Financially

156
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Invictus

157
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,231
But Charlene wasn't just going to up and leave

158
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
She got to figure something out

159
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,655
Owning your own home has long been seen as a Cornerstone of middle-class stability in this country

160
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:08,543
Home ownership helps you build wealth and as long as you're able to pay your mortgage you don't have to worry about getting evicted

161
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,615
That security is kind of Why We Buy Houses

162
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,943
But that security just isn't there for many mobile home owner

163
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
Including Shirleen still open

164
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
And the rest of the community at Applewood

165
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,183
Bring it back to their story in the second but to understand how a mobile home owners ended up in the precarious position

166
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,231
End of owning a home without land

167
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
We have to go back to the early 20th century

168
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
And the dawn of the automobile

169
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,119
People

170
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,911
Add cars for the first time in

171
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:40,287
Could go out and explore America by attaching little trailers to the back

172
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,127
Of their model T's or whatever cars they had

173
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
This is Andrew Hurley

174
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,247
History professor at the University of Missouri st. Louis

175
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,087
He says that the first trailer owners were wealthy vacationers

176
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
Tin Can tourist

177
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:00,255
Trailer happy as can be

178
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,959
But then came the Great Depression

179
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
When migrant workers started Living

180
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,591
And trailers full time as they travel the country looking for work

181
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,919
And so there were thousands of it

182
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,479
Generant individuals and Families

183
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,527
In search of work that

184
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
Didn't really know

185
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
One day

186
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
Or if they would be coming back to

187
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
Where they had originated

188
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
Han Solo trailer

189
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,511
Was something that they could

190
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
Attached to the back of their

191
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Car

192
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,143
And just take their home along with them

193
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
And

194
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,983
They started the site these homes

195
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
Together in

196
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
Basically what became the first mobile home park

197
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,663
These Parks were really seen as a

198
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Major

199
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Drain

200
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
Unlocal resource

201
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,575
Writings of the timer for two bees as trailer slum

202
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:03,231
This was the beginning of a kind of classes trailer stigma that is still very much around today

203
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:08,607
But the event that really solidified the trailer as a viable form of American housing

204
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Was World War II

205
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,007
American industry has met the challenge of Horror

206
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,823
American factories have achieved The Impossible

207
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,639
American mass production is delivering the goods

208
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
Is the war got underway

209
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,015
Factories popped up in all these remote parts of the country

210
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
But because

211
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,623
They had been undeveloped

212
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
It was no

213
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Housing

214
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
And

215
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,535
There was no capacity to build a new housing

216
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,351
Because Construction

217
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
Materials

218
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,447
Upward prioritized for war production

219
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,055
So the government bought thousands of trailers to house the wartime Workforce

220
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
But this was always supposed to be at

221
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
Temporary solution

222
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,015
When the war ended the expectation was that people would give up their trailers and move back in the conventional home

223
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
That didn't happen

224
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:06,207
Trailers continue to be an affordable housing option for people who didn't have the money to buy a home in the expanding

225
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Suburbs

226
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:13,375
And a lot of these mobile home owners rented pads in one of the many mobile home parks that were popping up all over the country

227
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
Esther Sullivan says

228
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,007
These parts continue to spread throughout the 60s 70s and 80s

229
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,311
As the government was investing less and less

230
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
Public housing

231
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
So just as

232
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
We've increasingly

233
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,735
Slashed the budget of Hud

234
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,551
And the production of affordable housing

235
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Weed scene

236
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
Incredible rise

237
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
Manufactured housing and specifically

238
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
Manufactured housing mobile home parks

239
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
To fill that Gap

240
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,959
Mobile homes were never really able to shake off the stigma that began during the Great Depression

241
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,799
People just did not want a home parks built in their backyard

242
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
In fact

243
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,687
Cities use all the tools in the urban planning tool kit to render mobile home parks

244
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Invisible

245
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,271
For the last half of a century

246
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,087
Planning and zoning laws have required

247
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
That Mobile Home Park

248
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
Walled in

249
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Fenced off

250
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
Visually screen

251
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,071
Landscaped out of sight

252
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
So that

253
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
The average

254
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,935
Citizen in a town or city

255
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,239
Might not ever know that a park was

256
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Locate

257
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Where was lo

258
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,639
These Parks were often built on marginal land on the outskirts of cities

259
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,759
Bill's mobile homes are legally classified as a form of transportation other than housing

260
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,087
They can be built on land that wasn't zoned residential

261
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
So separate them

262
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
From

263
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,439
Residences and single-family homes

264
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
More often Place mobile homes in

265
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
Commercial or industrial zones

266
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
As well as in hazardous places like

267
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
Floodplains or substandard lamb

268
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,847
Cities develop and expand mobile home parks become valuable proper

269
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,919
I can be bought up and redevelop into something more profitable

270
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
A new apartment building

271
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,503
Condo complex for a Walmart

272
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
Almost any other land use

273
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Is

274
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
Prioritize

275
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,135
Ice over a mobile home park

276
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
In

277
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
The decision

278
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,231
Of local city councils

279
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,047
And in the eyes of Developers

280
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,095
And the Redevelopment of a mobile home park

281
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Means math addiction

282
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Mobile home park residence

283
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,239
Which brings us back to Midvale Utah

284
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:32,639
And that little mobile home park for seniors where over 50 manufactured homes were on the verge of being a dick

285
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,687
To make way for an apartment complex

286
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:41,087
I asked everyone I met at Applewood if they consider the possibility of Redevelopment and eviction when they moved in

287
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,391
I just hadn't thought about that fat

288
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
This is Beth Durfee

289
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:49,279
She moved into Applewood with her husband Russell a couple of years ago

290
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,631
The fact that I would have to remove my home or leave my home and

291
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,703
Having to move out I never thought that was possible

292
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
Until they told me

293
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
That it was

294
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,711
A lot of people including many developers assume that if you evict a mobile home park the residence

295
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,759
I got their houses and moving somewhere else

296
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
But the truth is

297
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,343
Mobile homes aren't really mobile

298
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,951
In the mid-twentieth century the mobile home industry split into

299
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,279
One branch continued making travel trailers and RV's

300
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,631
Well the other started manufacturing houses designed to be lived in full time

301
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:31,519
These mobile home started to look less like trailers and more like conventional single family houses with

302
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,591
Multiple rooms and hallways in in for bathrooms

303
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
And they got harder and harder to move

304
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,503
The term mobile home is more or less in the snow

305
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Ended

306
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,111
To be mobile except when it is

307
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
First transported from the factory

308
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,951
And installed on the side

309
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,255
And if you try to move it again

310
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,303
It requires specialized

311
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,655
Trucking and Hauling at Great expense to homeowners it can cause between

312
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
5 + $15,000

313
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
First to move one of these

314
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,335
Moving can also cause serious structural problems

315
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,919
It can damage the home so severely that it becomes unlivable

316
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,527
And even if residents of Applewood were willing to take that risk

317
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,599
Had a spare $15,000 lying around

318
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,927
Finding a new place to put their home could be next to Impossible

319
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,511
Because there has not been any new manufactured

320
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Home

321
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Community

322
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Built

323
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Utah

324
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
For a long long time

325
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
There's not that many spaces

326
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,495
In any of these parks to put

327
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
56 homes

328
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
This is Charlene stovin again

329
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,663
She says that if she got evicted she would probably have to abandon her home

330
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
And move in with one of her kids

331
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,503
But some of these people have no family

332
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,295
Or their family so far away

333
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
Where would they go

334
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,207
Charlene was determined not to let that happen at Applewood

335
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,559
And she talked to some local community organizer to advisor to start a homeowners assoc

336
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,935
So first meeting with a carport I can't remember which Powerpuff Girl one of the car parts are we all met

337
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,751
Decided this is what we needed to do save ourselves

338
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Interested

339
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
Of course

340
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,895
And I thought okay what do I do now

341
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
I'm clueless

342
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:20,063
But she kept asking people for help and little by little they started rallying people to their cause

343
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
The residents started a petition

344
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,927
To save a boy and got over 2600 signatures

345
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,255
Charlene testify before the mayor and the city council

346
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
And told them

347
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,071
If we allow this guess what

348
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
You're going to have

349
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
56

350
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
Homeowners

351
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
That will be

352
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
And what are you going to do with it

353
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:45,151
Homelessness is a huge problem in Utah right now and it's been exacerbated by a housing shortage

354
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:51,039
And apartment complexes are going up all over the Salt Lake Valley to try and meet a growing demand

355
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
Charlene says that's good

356
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
You need the apartment

357
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,719
Displaced people in order to do it

358
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,351
Charlene in the other residents of Applewood fought for several years to stay in their homes

359
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,191
There were a lot of twists and turns and late nights in a whole lot of emails

360
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
But eventually

361
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
After a lot of public pressure

362
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,311
The development company gave up on the project

363
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,871
He decided to put Applewood up for sale

364
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,479
Her that she remembered an organization that she thought might be able to help them out

365
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
I was called

366
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
Rock USA

367
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,623
Yasso Roc stands for Resident owned communities

368
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:32,255
And we help homeowners in mobile home parks by their communities as Co-op

369
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
This is Paul Bradley

370
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
The president of Rock USA

371
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
Which is based in New Hampshire

372
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:42,239
Bradley began organizing mobile home coops with the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund

373
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
Back in the 80s

374
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:49,919
They even got legislation passed in New Hampshire that gives mobile homeowners a first option to purchase the land whenever

375
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Close up for sale

376
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
Today about 27% of the

377
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
Manufactured home communities are Mobile Home Park

378
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,111
In New Hampshire are resident owned

379
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,951
Now so that's a hundred and twenty-seven or so communities

380
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:08,351
Bradley thinks we need to build more affordable housing but he also wants to protect the affordable housing we already have

381
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:13,983
Right now mobile homes represent the largest source of unsubsidized affordable housing produced in this country

382
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,591
Bradley says that if we can help mobile home owners by the land beneath their parks

383
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,407
Then the risk of mass eviction disappears

384
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,503
And so in 2008 Bradley launch Rock USA

385
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,599
Effort to spread New Hampshire is cooperative ownership model Nationwide

386
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,647
So far they've been really successful

387
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:36,767
National network of just over 220 communities 14000 homeowners

388
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
And we're operating with coops

389
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
15 states

390
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,727
When Charlene called Paul Bradley things were not looking good for Applewood

391
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,055
The land had already been sold to to new Developers

392
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,359
44.8 million dollars

393
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,687
But Charlene Paul approach the new owners explain the situation

394
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
They talked about how difficult it would be to move their homes

395
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,087
And ask if the new owners would be willing to sell the park to the residence

396
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
And they said

397
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:08,767
We didn't realize you you wanted to purchase the property but if you if you want to and you can do it within the next

398
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,815
Couple of months will sell it to you

399
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
Otherwise if we're going to

400
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,167
We're going to own it eventually we're going to close it down

401
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,775
Buying a mobile home park worth at least 4.8 million dollars

402
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,103
Seems like a very tall order for the residence of Applewood

403
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,151
Individually no one in the park

404
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,711
Even come close to getting a mortgage for that kind of money

405
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,295
But together as a co-op the financial picture was different

406
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,927
Rock USA was willing to give the residence of very low interest loan for 3.6 million

407
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:43,327
They would still need to find some more money though and so they went to a low income housing form in Utah called the Olene Walker house

408
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
Housing Loan Fund

409
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
So there I am again

410
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Pleading

411
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
Mycase

412
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,799
And Gloria who is the director

413
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
Sad

414
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
I thought about this the last 3 months

415
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
And I've decided

416
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
We need to help

417
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
These people

418
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,551
We need to give them the money they need

419
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,367
So between it all we finally come up with

420
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,159
5 million that we needed

421
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
And on February 9th

422
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Resigned

423
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
So we own

424
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,143
After four and a half years of fighting for their little piece of ground

425
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:22,239
Bland officially belongs to the Applewood Homeowners cooperative

426
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:29,151
To pay off their Collective mortgage the residents agreed to pay $60 more a month than they had previously been paying in rent

427
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
It's going to be a challenge for some of them

428
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,271
But the monthly cost be stable from here on out

429
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,575
Worried about eviction

430
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:41,183
We can breathe again I got to worry about losing our home and everything would have had in it

431
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
Or we can order home

432
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
Fieldease

433
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,887
This is Russell Durfee who lives in Applewood with his wife Beth who you heard from earlier

434
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,935
He says that at their age

435
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
They're just happy to have us

436
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
Secure place to live

437
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,311
We're getting so old and feeble

438
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,431
But we don't know how much longer we're going to live so I want to go grocery shopping or dare

439
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
Everybody Green from

440
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,855
Red Hawk rifles

441
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,655
Charlene is also relieved but completely

442
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
They own the place now

443
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
I got caught up to run

444
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
And bills to pay

445
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,031
Before it was

446
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Fighting

447
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
To gain

448
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
The land

449
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
Now it's a whole different

450
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
Set of pressures of Jessie

451
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
Getting this running smooth

452
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,039
And the coop is a different ball

453
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,599
Because now we're in charge

454
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
It's up to us to make it work

455
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
Otherwise we're in deep

456
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
Deep doo-doo

457
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
But they aren't on their own

458
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,839
Rock USA is helping them structure the coop

459
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
And deal with the finances

460
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
And of course

461
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,959
A Cooperative Applewood means Cooperative living

462
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
There are lots of meetings and elections

463
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Committees

464
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Archimedes

465
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
Where's the community rules

466
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,455
Where's the finance committee there is irritation committee there's a major

467
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,551
These are officers were trying to get organized

468
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,135
Russell Durfee says he's not well enough

469
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
Participate as much as you would like

470
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,256
But you went the first general meeting of the coop and he was really impressed

471
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,840
They asked for volunteers to be president vice president

472
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
4/4

473
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,936
And every and every position they had volunteers

474
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
Didn't have to

475
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
Coke people

476
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,056
Servant leader leader

477
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,360
Automatically wanted to do it

478
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,688
Russell says they have lots of different skills and

479
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,736
Decades of experience here in Applewood

480
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,296
And their talents

481
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,136
Example is a retired engineer

482
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,952
Are secretaries going to automatic she was

483
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
Secretary for a police

484
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
I asked how she could

485
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
Prosper

486
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,424
Lymph node about to get all the notes down in Fort Worth

487
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
I did it for many years

488
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
The coop is going to be a lot of work

489
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,360
But at least for now people are glad to be part of it

490
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
And to finally own the land under their home

491
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
Together

492
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:28,352
Esther Sullivan the sociologist we spoke to for the story has a new book out later this year

493
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,656
It's called manufactured insecurity

494
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:34,240
Mobile home parks in Americans tenuous right to play

495
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:39,104
Cherokee lived in several mobile home parks that were undergoing eviction and study the impacts

496
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,408
You can find a link to the book on our website

499
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:53,440
The ever-evolving design of mobile homes and the concept of mobile home skyscrapers

500
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,720
Right after this

501
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
Between the beats

502
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,680
Bongs and chatter of our devices

503
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:07,264
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

504
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
If

505
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,688
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

506
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
Technology

507
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
She talked to us

508
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,624
It is a creation of Sonic trash

509
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,696
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

510
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,280
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

511
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,072
To make them more human

512
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,168
Turn the living room lights on

513
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
Okay

514
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,520
Dim the living room lights to 50%

515
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Okay

516
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,712
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

517
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
Makes for a much more natural

518
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Experience

519
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
Turn the living room lights on

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,904
Dim the living room lights

521
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
50%

522
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:04,352
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

523
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,168
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

524
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,728
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

525
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,544
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

526

528
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,200
We need to talk about something

529
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:25,600
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives

530
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Routine

531
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,416
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

532
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,816
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

533
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:41,216
And it may be time to seek help go to oh my God. Info podcast we can learn more

Flash podcast

537
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:53,248
When Emmett was reporting the story he discovered all the different names for these things

538
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:58,368
And that they were used interchangeably but also had different meanings for different people

And Coco said is here talk about the rise of the term mobile home

542
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,352
And how that design evolved over time

543
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,424
Right and Emma was telling me that

544
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,824
But when he was interviewing people for the story like everybody was just using a different term for sort of the same thing and put this actual

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Turn mobile

546
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384

00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,504
Was actually coined by a man named Elmer Frey

550
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
And I helped build a verify that

551
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,464
Independently but Frey did play a big role in popular I think it is nothing else and he's this really interesting character in love

552
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,048
40s he started a mobile home manufacturing business in Wisconsin

553
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,608
And he sold a lot of these 8 ft wide homes

554
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,704
We also lobbied to be able to transport 10-foot wides on public Road

555
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,032
And what is the big difference between an 8-foot wide home in it

556
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,056
Infant White

557
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,896
So if you think about a typical mobile home at the time

558
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,200
The real limitation is that horizontal to me

559
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:59,552
You can make one that stuff in the feet long fence really hard to fit in

560
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
Balls in hallway

561
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
It's too thin

562
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,904
So if you add a few feet of width

563
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,952
You can certainly subdivide space

564
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
Create rooms

565
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,024
And connecting the outside chords

566
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,328
So now you can walk

567
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:15,936
Pastis fully-enclosed individual spaces rather than always stepping through one room to

568
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
To another

569
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,032
That means you got privacy and you can fit a Pamela more comfortable

570
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,336
Sabillasville to make one

571
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
Expand on site

572
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Become wider

573
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:28,224
And then of course he got your double wides in your triple wides designed to be joined together

574
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,528
And as you make these leaves

575
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,576
It sounds like mobile home is already coming

576
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
Less and less mobile

577
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Actually

578
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,024
Exactly is Pennywise in the 12 I've gained popularity they were increasingly created to just be shipped out sat down and lived

579
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,632
Do you know the US Department of Housing and Urban Development this post

580
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:49,984
The problem a lot of these relatively new mobile homes were not being construct

581
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,288
The same standards as normal Lotto

582
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,616
So in the mid-1970s Congress pass

583
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,920
Mobile home construction and safety standards

584
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,992
Which basically was to make sure that

585
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,296
New manufactured homes will be more energy of

586
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,576
In disaster resist

587
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,672
It's a one of those regulations due to the industry and the mobile home housing stock

588
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:15,328
What would you hide code set standards for things like safety and durability but also heating Plumbing ventilation

589
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,608
Air conditioning

590
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
Electrical systems

591
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,984
All those things you normally associate with Regional building codes but that didn't

592
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
Always apply to mobile homes

593
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:28,640
Federal sampling this is where that manufactured homes distinction comes in

594
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,200
Predictably of course some people

595
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:36,832
In the business of producing prefab homes work exactly pleased with the added layer of regulations on sick

596
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,928
First year of the new rules deadly the better Design interior Construction

597
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,280
She mentions her brains book how buildings learn which is all about the ways that buildings

598
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
Evolve and adapt over time

599
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,352
It seems to me that

600
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,656
And whatever you call these types of homes

601
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,936
Trubisky

602
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:56,032
Pre-designed self-contained and they're not really designed to change

603
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:01,664
Yeah in a way that's true they don't have to change over time you know the factory build it ships it out

604
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,456
That's down plugs it in and it's

605
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,248
Good2Go

606
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,344
Brandpoint that these initial modules are actually rich with potential to

607
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
As he puts it

608
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,672
A small unit can become the quotes

609
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,976
Seed around which a larger home grows

610
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,792
So for instance an owner might build a shed roof

611
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560
Taqueria port

612
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,656
Men eventually in clothes that on all sides to create interior space

613
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,448
Super Sunday

614
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,984
Can't afford a house right away

615
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
A big house

616
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,568
This kind of base model approach

617
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,384
Allows owners to build out on their own terms

618
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,664
Let me have the time and the

619
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,760
Of course this is also tied up in that increasing in mobility of

620
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Manufactured housing

621
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,088
Right once you start expanding this thing

622
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
Are the staff

623
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:48,512
And so what about Friday the original mobile home popularizer with a builder and seller of these kinds of structures

624
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
What was his reaction to the

625
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
Shift from mobile homes to these

626
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,144
Immobile manufacturer

627
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:59,520
So he ended up exploring some pretty extreme ideas in the 1960s and 70s

628
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,080
Well heads over here developing standards

629
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
Free

630
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,920
Is actually proposing skyscrapers for mobile home

631
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,224
And one of those early plans was to rectum

632
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,272
Is two spiraling Towers in Milwaukee

633
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,320
It was hundreds of parking spaces

634
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,344
For portable dwelling

635
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,160
And those Powers were also at restaurants and shops

636
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
Community spaces

637
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,976
Above and below the parking fee

638
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
Living areas

639
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:26,400
So maybe you stay for a few years parking brake

640
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
New job

641
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:33,568
NH place you'd be living in a walkable downtown and that's reminiscent of Ready Player one where the main character lives

642
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:37,664
Stacks really Stacks and stacks of mobile house yet don't really look

643
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,528
All that night's exactly know I mean they're they're really kind of not very appealing and

644
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:47,392
Frankly the Prototype that frame made the sort of they were just a couple stories tall and they

645
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,696
Basically look like that

646
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,000
Weren't that appealing and they didn't work that well

647
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:56,608
But his larger vision of he's really tall towers was actually pretty interesting

648
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Things you think about

649
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:03,776
You know if it worked out his so-called skyscraper terrorist could have brought mobile housing right into the heart of City

650
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,616
Combined Mobility with Urban density and I really

651
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
Unprecedented

652
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:15,808
Will you can see pictures of phrase proposed skyscraper Terrace and other vertical mobile housing designs on our website it's in that

Series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

681

687
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:06,912
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

688
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:11,264
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

689
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,592
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

690
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
A dad

691
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,968
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

692
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:24,320
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

693
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,744
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

694
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,072
Was found dead in my private gym

695
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,400
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

696
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:42,752
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

697
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
Now

698
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,080
I need to clear my name
