San franciscans have a healthy pride in their City

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,240
Maybe their pride is a little too healthy sometimes a little over-the-top

30
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,776
But they acknowledge this

31
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
It's the natural result

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,128

But even the most die-hard San Franciscan has to admit

35
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
It could be better

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,744
Like if there was a funicular transport suspended from a bridge of a soaring Towers over the bag

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,048
Connecting downtown San Francisco

38
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584

44
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,112
From the April 17th 1910 Edition

45
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
Of the San Francisco call

16 million-dollar so that Fletcher Phelps can spend the day with his suspended auto motor Railway

50
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,664
Play which promises to revolutionize all kinds of traffic by rail

51
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,992
I'm going to use my old timey reporter voice here

Google Play Savannah ganondagan for you have scarcely made yourself comfortable in your seat when burned

53
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,768
You are flying across the bay in midair with the speed of a gun projectile

54
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
And almost before you can say

00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
Jackie Robinson

00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,216

00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080

60
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,640
We are going to have such a railway

61
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,968
Oprah show you say contemptuously

62
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,016
It's only a dream

63
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
No

64
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
Some dreams

65
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
Come true

66
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
And they just don't write them like that anymore which would have been absolutely amazing if that have

67
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
Happens this is one that I really wish that happened

68
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,984
Quite sad that it

69
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
Happen

70
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,312
These are stories of the unbuilt structures

71
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,152
A subject which is really captured the imagination of the public recently

72
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,016
Funville San Francisco with a series of events and Exhibits explain the things that

73
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
Almost made it

74
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
Can the effects it would have had on the city

75
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:14,464
And there was also a huge exhibit called Never built in Los Angeles

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
In the classification of unbuilt structures I put Fletcher e feltz's suspended auto motor Railway

77
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
In a group icon

78
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
Jetsons

79
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,311
The Retro future pictures are super cool

80
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
Reminder

81
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
When we used to dream big

82
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,991
In the parallel universe of unbuilt structures in San Francisco

83
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,343
The big fish that Got Away the white whale that urban planning nerds

84
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Was a city plan

85
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
From the Creator

86
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
Other White City

87
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,999
San Franciscan

88
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,351
The One That Got Away was the Daniel Burnham plan for San Francisco

89
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,423
That San Francisco Chronicle architecture critic John King

90
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,239
Daniel Burnham was a Chicago architect

91
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
Who oversaw Construction

92
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
Of the White City

93
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,383
At the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago

94
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
That World's Fair

95
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,735
Brought about the city beautiful movement in

96
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
America

97
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
The city beautiful movement

98
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:17,695
With big Civic centers and Grand neoclassical structures that stir the soul

99
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,095
Burnham years later I did the Chicago plan he did a Washington plan which was implemented in a lot of ways

100
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,239
Burnham was hired by Big Time downtown business owners of San Francisco determinism raggedy rickety

101
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
Pretty well off City

102
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
Into something Majestic

103
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
Who better to charge

104
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
Of course the city Daniel Burnham

105
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,479
So Daniel Bernstein shows up and they set up shop

106
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
The cottage

107
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
On the highest point the summit of Twin Peaks

108
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
So they can survey the city

109
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
And craft the perfect plan

110
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
And here is this

111
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,023
On how to take San Francisco

112
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,911
The rich Queen City of the gold rush in the silver rush and so on and so forth

113
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,471
Andre make it with this

114
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Imperial order

115
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,615
With diagonal boulevards connecting all the different neighborhoods of the city

116
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,223
The main Hills Telegraph Hill Bernal Heights

117
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
Twin Peaks one or two others

118
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:20,159
Turned into these open Civic markers so on and so forth

119
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,511
In a basically the city as a work of urban art

120
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,839
Supernova turns into plan to the citic fathers

121
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,911
In the fall of 1905

122
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,239
You might be able to tell where this is going

123
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
There's a big

124
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,823
Banquet everyone says that

125
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
Wonderful

126
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
The project is printed up in books

127
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,991
To distribute to begin making the case

128
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,831
And the legend goes that all the books were delivered to City Hall for distribution

129
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
On April 17th

130
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
1906

131
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,255
Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration but basically the whole plan was done

132
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,071
Turn it up ready for distribution in the 1906

133
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
On the very next day

134
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
April 18th

135
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
In the city level

136
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,519
Into this is the opportunity this is San Francisco's chance

137
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,079
To enact the Imperial Burnham plan

138
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:15,711
And the chronicle which was the big paper the time embraced it everybody said this is great

139
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
Let's bring out Burnham

140
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
This is the way to start

141
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
Everybody blessed it and endorsed it

142
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
But in some way

143
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
The plan unravel

144
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,023
It's something every city ravaged by disaster is seen

145
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,095
There is the way to do it and there's the way to rebuild quickly

146
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,935
Everyone who would Embrace did it first pretty sooner than symbol

147
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,775
The business of San Francisco is getting back to business and rebuild and showing people

148
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
We don't have time to do these crazy things

149
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,687
Burnham and his supporters kept trying to do these crazy things from near and far

150
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,759
But none of the real things he proposed

151
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
Stuck at all

152
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
Because they just

153
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,439
What had seemed to be an opportunity for them to be done

154
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231
In fact

155
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
Created the pressure

156
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,327
Just to go back to the way things

157
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,655
It's Lower Manhattan after 9/11

158
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,447
What's New Orleans

159
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
After Katrina

160
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
Again and again and again

161
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
Those are two things

162
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,127
High-speed hanging Bullets Over The Bay

163
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
Analogical City

164
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:23,551
That we can hold in our imagination than curse our forebears for being so short-sighted

165
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
But quite honestly

166
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,927
A lot of things probably most of the things that we

167
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Gold designer belt

168
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
Would have been just terrible

169
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,327
I mean here in the Bay Area alone

170
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
Plenty of near disasters that

171
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Lowe's

172
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
To becoming a reality

173
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,007
Stuff so bad

174
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,799
He'll make you want to reach out and

175
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
Hug and NIMBY

176
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,663
And the culprit in the most terrible plans for the city

177
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
Was the automobile

178
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,831
They were proposed highway system that would carve up San Francisco in unimaginable ways

179
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
But here

180
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,159
They are certainly not alone

181
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,255
The invisible never built parallel universe bands Coast to Coast

182
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
And there are cartographers

183
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
Are these unbuilt world

184
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,887
Our producer Sam Greenspan spoke with one of them

185
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
A guy who calls himself

186
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,751
Been smoking Rockin I go under the name of vanshnookenraggen

187
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,799
It doesn't mean anything it's pure gibberish

188
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,359
My actual name is Andrew Lynch

189
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,175
AKA Andrew Lynch

190
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,503
He's a professional realtor and amateur cartographer

191
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
In New York City

192
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
Annies maps that he made

193
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,367
They first glance look like

194
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Google Maps

195
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
New York City of the streets and everything

196
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
If you ever looked at a Google map

197
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
You know exactly what this looks like

198
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,351
Cray for the landmass blue for the water

199
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
Arterial roads there yellow if there side streets

200
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
White it's just like any other map

201
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
Except

202
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
Except that

203
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
The mattress looking at isn't

204
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
But really there

205
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,639
Andrew's map doesn't represent what is

206
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
It represents what almost was

207
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
What I've done is

208
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
To draw

209
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
What Google Maps would look like

210
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
If

211
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
Robert Moses

212
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,159
Had gotten his way in the

213
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Mid-twentieth century

214
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
Okay so first we got to talk about Robert Mueller

215
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,047
The true power broker of New York

216
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:16,447
And we know that Robert Moses was the true power broker of New York because the title of Robert Caro's 1100 pay

217
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
Age biography of him

218
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Is

219
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
The power broker

220
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,359
I've read it it's so good it's daunting but

221
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Power through it

222
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:29,503
It really is worth it in public housing

223
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,087
He did a lot of the master planning of New York City and its surroundings

224
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,391
Stephen restructure the city government

225
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
But some of what he's most famous

226
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
I really Infamous for

227
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
Is what didn't get built

228
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,863
You see Robert Moses was a Man Who Loved highways

229
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,959
He wanted to build two highways through Manhattan 1 to downtown

230
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Through

231
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
Soho and Tribeca

232
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
+ 1 through Midtown

233
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
Just south of 34th Street

234
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,431
And that's what Andrew Lynch has drawn into the Google Map

235
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
What does highways would look like

236
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Today

237
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
Now if you're thinking

238
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,879
This is totally insane massive gnarled

239
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,183
Perpetual traffic jam through Manhattan

240
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,255
You have to understand what was going on at the time

241
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,559
Manhattan wasn't made for cars

242
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,119
And a lot of people really wanted them

243
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
So just like cities today

244
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,775
They were trying to solve the problem of a city that didn't function in the modern era

245
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
And also

246
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
Here's a fun fact

247
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,639
Robert Moses didn't drive

248
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
Can drivers

249
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,735
Cardizem around an indoor

250
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,039
The horrible New York traffic for him

251
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
Sit in the backseat

252
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
In gaze out the window at the scenery

253
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,207
But the rest will be in to have to drive ourselves

254
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:47,583
These highways probably would have inspired no small amount of terrible anxiety

255
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,887
This was a spaghetti network of

256
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
Wrapping themselves

257
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Around building

258
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,495
Real talk

259
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:59,103
Probably would have been too much worse than any other giant Highway interchange

260
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
Anywhere else

261
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,919
I'm like everywhere else

262
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,967
These highways wouldn't have worked

263
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,063
We know now that traffic always expands to fill whatever the capacity

264
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
I mean maybe you could drive from Manhattan to Jersey like

265
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
5 minutes faster than you could today

266
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,767
But the real tragedy here wouldn't have been the failure of the highways Misha

267
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
It's a total catastrophe

268
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
It would have been left underneath

269
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:25,215
The Manhattan expressways would only feel like a slight nuisance if you are in a car

270
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
Put on the ground

271
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,543
Lower Manhattan in particular

272
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,103
Would be almost unrecognizable

273
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,943
It just so happened that when I was talking with Andrew we were in lower Manhattan

274
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Right on barracks

275
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,783
And as he was telling me about all this unbuilt

276
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Stop

277
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,903
I realize that a lot of these things were mere blocks from where we happen to be

278
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,207
I asked Andrew if he can give me a tour

279
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
What's not there

280
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
Going off

281
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
Right in front of us

282
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Would have been

283
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
If we go down a couple blocks

284
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
We could like stand right under it

285
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
You can hear the street traffic

286
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
It would have been ten times worse than this

287
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
It would have been dark

288
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
It would have been like we were approaching

289
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
Monstrous creature in darkness right now

290
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,487
Lots of car noises

291
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,887
But wish you always get next to a highway there would be these ramps going along the side streets rapping

292
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:31,519
Brown building to get from 3/4 stores in the air you have to have ramps coming down

293
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
The highway itself

294
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,943
Running down to West over there good luck finding anyone deliver Winston everywhere

295
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
A dynamic

296
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Hill's machinery

297
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
It's a really weird

298
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
Experience trying to

299
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Take a tour of

300
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
It's

301
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
You have to have a very active imagination

302
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
Which I do

303
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,959
But if you want to try it

304
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,055
Stand under it and then come here and then try to remember what that feels

305
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
Back in the real world

306
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,895
Things are quite nice around lower Manhattan

307
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
Where were standing out

308
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
It's open

309
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
Was trees over there

310
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
Is big buildings right here none of this was

311
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
It's a little bit of a Plaza

312
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Got shops

313
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
We're looking over there if there's

314
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Townhouses

315
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
Tenements

316
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Probably are asking way too much

317
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
What's for rents because

318
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Cuz where we are

319
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Nothing

320
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
None of this none of this would be

321
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,311
Which brings us back to Andrews map of Robert Moses unbuilt Manhattan

322
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
I think what's most striking about these documents

323
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
Is out on striking they are

324
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,479
With your Google standard Greys and blues and yellows

325
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,295
Andrew create a map to show how terrible these days

326
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
But in creating a map

327
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,391
He was actually able to see the project

328
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
From the Planters point

329
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
As I went through

330
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
Cutting across Manhattan

331
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,815
Before I drew in the highway I just looked at

332
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
The swap that I had

333
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Erased

334
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
It was an interesting

335
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Feeling

336
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
I could put myself in Robert MO

337
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Shoes wear

338
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
I'm not looking at a city with him

339
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
China map

340
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
And because I don't think

341
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Don't see the homes

342
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
The buildings

343
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,223
It's very tempting just be like okay

344
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
You just put it right there

345
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
You know not realizing

346
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
There's a disc

347
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Building out

348
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
I know what that building me

349
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
The place of peace

350
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,695
People live that people go that I've been to

351
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
And now it's

352
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
It's off the map.

353
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
It's funny to hear you describe your own

354
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
I wanted

355
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
To put this

356
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
For the everyday for

357
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
To look at this

358
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Inside wow

359
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
That would have been

360
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
I would have loved to be able to make

361
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Review

362
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,847
I like put yourself right there so you could

363
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Does Maps stand

364
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
And under the highway

365
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
See what it was

366
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
Was like

367
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
It does have the

368
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
Great Dark Mass above you

369
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,063
The story of how all this didn't come to be

370
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
Is a long

371
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,159
It often centers around the activist named Jane Jacobs

372
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,975
Who led a campaign to keep one of Moses highways

373
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,023
From destroying her beloved neighborhood

374
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Greenwich Village

375
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:06,399
And there are other factors like the massive cost of those highways that were proposed

376
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,703
Fat captain from happening as well

377
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
But the interesting part.

378
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,079
Is how that threat the Lower Manhattan Expressway

379
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,151
Crystalline the story of Jacob's neighborhood

380
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
It's almost as if

381
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
The threat

382
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
From Moses

383
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:25,087
Made Greenwich Village into the place that now seems destined to become

384
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
And that brings us back

385
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
To the San Francisco Bay Area

386
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,255
Is John King and Alison area

387
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
The unbuilt can in fact

388
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,607
Start what does Happ

389
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,167
So if you drive north

390
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
On the Golden Gate Bridge

391
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
Immediately to your

392
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,311
Left as you start to reach the end of the bridge you see

393
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,895
Tremendously beautiful Hills overlooking

394
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
The ocean

395
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
I'm in the base the other side

396
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,783
And there's nothing built on those Hills it's

397
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,159
It's all natural Landscaping those people biking and walking and it's really help it go all the way out to the headlines

398
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:06,559
And when you see it for the first time it's kind of hard to believe that this much open beautiful landscape exist right next to one

399
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,119
One of the most expensive cities in the world

400
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,191
And just kind of remarkable because obviously it would be

401
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,263
Some of the most Prime real estate in the area and facts

402
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
In the sexiest

403
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,919
Someone attempted to do there and in the early sixties a developer thought

404
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,967
What a great place to build

405
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:28,063
20000 homes or so for people who are going to work in San Francisco

406
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
It was called

407
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:36,767
This was not seen as a rapacious idea at the time this was seen it how business is done

408
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,095
It was a massive mix of houses and hours

409
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
And

410
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,751
It was approved with very little controversy by The Marin County Board of Supervisors

411
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,639
Limoncello being approved with enough to alarm people and start people reacting to it

412
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,551
And it led to lawsuits it led to opposition it led to local city starting to fight it

413
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:06,463
When the dust settled the project did not get built currently the only thing that was built was the gate that was going to lead to the marketing

414
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Center at the very start of the property

415
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:14,911
So the Golden Gate National Recreation Area was formed out of concern for all the various plans that were being proposed

416
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
Francello is blocked

417
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
The

418
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,591
Sutro Baths Lands End in San Francisco had a proposed kind of

419
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,383
Cancun type resorts

420
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,783
And if you are at all familiar with Lands End in San Francisco where the Sutro bath ruins are you no help

421
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
Silly that notion sounds

422
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,903
It is only Cancun as interpreted

423
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
By the North Pole

424
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,511
It is said there were various projects like that

425
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
What was proposed

426
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
Never got built

427
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
But it said

428
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,007
The events in motion that in fact

429
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
Tramadol landscape we have

430
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,527
What projects like that did in the early sixties

431
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
Is that they were a signal

432
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,743
Two people who cared about the topography the bay area in the proximity of open space to urbanized space

433
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
How to say

434
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,351
What are we going to do we can't fight every one of these battles occur

435
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:22,495
Is there a holistic way to go about it and you had some very smart people

436
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:28,895
Who came up with the idea of will what if there was a national park it could take in all this

437
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,223
And Marin cello maybe on Belt

438
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,527
But to say that there's nothing there in the headlands

439
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,831
Is not seeing the grand thing

440
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,415
San Francisco actually did build for itself and everyone else you visit

441
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,487
What they actually did build over there

442
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,767
Was the reason

443
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
We all love it here

444
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:57,311

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made

450
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375

463
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,871
Makes for a much more natural experience

464
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
Turn the living room lights on

465
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,015
