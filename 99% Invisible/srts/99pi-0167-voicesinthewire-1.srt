33

On our way to Canaan land

34
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,600
Here we go there are those innovations that everyone loves and depends on your Big E

35
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,416
Like computers electricity the printing press

36
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,000
And then there are the innovations that made you who you are

37
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
Punk rock music

38
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
Photo copiers cassettes nunchucks

39
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:49,728
But if I were to write them I think the two most important technological innovations to my life

40
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,056
Broadcasting in home sound recording

41
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
Today at two of my favorite stories from two of my favorite Indie Productions all about the early days of broadcasting and record

42
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
Ray utopians Radio Diaries in the kitchen sisters represent the best of what we can achieve an audio storytelling and here they

43
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,440
They are tackling the subjects that are near and dear to my heart

44
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,816
These pieces were first broadcast on NPR as part of the kitchen sisters lost and found sounds.

45
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
First step

46
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:23,008
With his story of Conrad's garage and the birth of commercial broadcasting in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania this is Joe Ricci

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
From Radio Diaries

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
Produced in 2001

49
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:33,760
The sounds that came out of Frank Conrad's Garage in 1919 and 1920

50
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
Argon

51
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:40,160
There were no recordings made and everyone who participated in those weekly broadcast has died

52
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
In fact

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,536
There may be only one person still alive who actually heard what was going on in that garage

54
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
A man named Harry Mills

55
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,632
This is k4h

56
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
You

57
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,360
Hello Charlie d1h VA here's k4h you how are you this evening

58
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,480
Henry Mills is 94 years old

59
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,296
Using engineer for RCA most of his life

60
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
But the last eight decades

61
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
He's been going on the ham radio

62
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
Just about every day

63
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,744
Mills first discovered radio in 1919

64
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
He was 12 years old

65
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,351
And his parents bought him a copy of the Boy Scout Handbook

66
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
In the book

67
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:27,775
Afterlotto the camping in the setting up a tent in the rain and helping the old lady cross the street and so on

68
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
In the back was a

69
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,383
Chapter on how to build a wireless station

70
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
I've never heard of such a thing

71
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
So I built one

72
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,575
I'll show you how it works

73
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,927
It was gold out of photographic plates and tinfoil the condenser and this is

74
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Weather stripping

75
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
This is a Ford coil

76
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,839
Ford ignition coil which would hook onto your antenna on your on the air

77
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,471
This is what radio sounded like windmills were started

78
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
Dashes

79
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,359
That's the letter v

80
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
What you use for test purpose

81
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,711
The hears me he come back

82
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
And we'd hold a conversation

83
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
Simple as that

84
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
Almost every night

85
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
Harry millswood line is bad

86
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,231
And listen to the amateur radio operators signal back and forth

87
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
And one night he heard something different

88
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
Remember

89
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
At 10:11 at night

90
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
And all I wants this voice

91
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
Appears

92
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
And remember

93
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Reading out of Yelp

94
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
Sheldon some sort my dad doing

95
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,919
Hey just gotten out of that vast come in wrapped in a towel this because you're always alright

96
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
Somebody hadn't happened to me and I said

97
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,295
Dad look I'm hearing this fellow talking

98
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,391
Damn that we shared the headphones only have one pair of headphones

99
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
He allowed his I was right

100
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,303
Harry Mills had stumbled onto the experimental transmission

101
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
Frank Conrad garage

102
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
35 MI

103
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:02,751
It was talking to me says now I'm going to play a phonograph

104
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,151
It was astounding I I didn't know you could do that voice before

105
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,711
Trinidad that the music

106
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,831
It opens up a whole new world

107
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,927
Frank Conrad was not the first person to talk and play music on the radio

108
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,767
Veterans like Reginald fessenden Lee Deforest and Marconi

109
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,583
I've been doing such experiments as early as 1906

110
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,935
But back then radio was seen as a method of one-to-one communication

111
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
Like the telegraph

112
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,311
New Edition radio is a way to reach many people at the same time

113
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
To broadcast

114
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,431
Frank Conrad was among the first to use the word broadcasting

115
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:47,807
It was originally an agricultural term used to describe the distribution of seeds over a large area

116
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855
In his garage

117
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,903
Conrad help to change the concept

118
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
A radio

119
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,743
He did it largely by accident

120
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
Testing testing

121
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
Testing one two

122
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
3 + 1

123
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
Frank Conrad from the garage

124
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
What it would have sounded like

125
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:13,663
It's probably fair to say that nobody cares more about Frank Conrad's garage

126
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
Then a man named Rick Harris

127
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
Harris has an amateur historian who has dedicated his life

128
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,855
To preserving and researching the history of that garage

129
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,183
He's collected replicas of the equipment Conrad used

130
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
A microphone

131
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
Made out of the top of a Candlestick telephone

132
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
Mounted in a small box stuff

133
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
And a hand crank victrola

134
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
You turn the crank

135
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,775
Rick Harris says the story of Frank Conrad's garage

136
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
Really begins with that victrola

137
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
Conrad was an engineer for Westinghouse

138
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,431
So we had access to vacuum tube

139
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
Allow them to transmit voice over the air

140
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
But at the time

141
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
ConEd wasn't thinking about Broadcasting

142
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,903
He was simply trying to test and improve his transmitting it

143
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,511
The problem was his voice after talking endless hours

144
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
Into the microphone would wear out so

145
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:07,167
He got the idea one day to put on a record that would give him two or three minutes

146
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,983
To adjust his equipment and would save his voice

147
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:15,871
This one is an ancient one so I don't know what it's going to sound like though

148
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:22,527
And as soon as he started playing the music

149
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,087
Began getting requests for

150
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:31,487
More music and he would get phone calls and letters asking him to play a certain song at a certain time so some

151
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:37,887
Someone listening with their crystal said could convince the relative that you could actually play music over the air

152
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,495
He found very quickly that there was an unseen audience out there

153
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,663
England call me up at 9

154
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
This is Frank Conrad

155
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,271
Recorded in the late 1930s not long before

156
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
He died

157
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,575
Anybody got do it

158
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,647
The program

159
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
Everyone's in Saturday night

160
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,791
Places that time and I had no idea what

161
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,911
Overtime Conrad garage starting to sound more like a radio station

162
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,775
Along with phonograph records Conrad would transmit piano solos by family members

163
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Baseball scores

164
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,919
And then when he started to run out of Records to play Conrad went to the Hamilton music store

165
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
That's if he could borrow some for his broadcast

166
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,575
The owner said yes as long as Conrad agreed to announce the name of the store on the air

167
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,695
So the Conrad was building the one thing the radio industry hadn't yet thought much about

168
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
An audience

169
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,815
But the real Turning Point came on September 29th 1920

170
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,655
When did Joseph Horne department store place this ad in the Pittsburgh Sun

171
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,311
Are concert picked up by radio hear the music was from the victrola

172
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,359
And the home of Frank Conrad

173
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,991
Mr. Conrad is a wireless Enthusiast inputs on the wireless concerts periodically

174
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,551
For the entertainment of many people in this District

175
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
Who have wireless sets

176
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
Amateur Wireless sets

177
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
Are on sale here

178
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
$10 and up

179
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,071
Diane really caught the attention of Conrad's boss at Westinghouse Amman

180
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
By the name of Harry Davis who

181
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,191
Add to Story Goes called Conrad in the next day

182
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
And said

183
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
Essentially I would like to put you out of business

184
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
Because

185
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
I would like

186
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,383
Westinghouse to set up its own station

187
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
And

188
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
I Davis ask Conrad

189
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
Could that be done in Conrad set of course

190
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:35,903
So over the next month Conrad and his team began constructing a wooden Shack on the roof of the Westinghouse plant

191
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,463
They built a 100 watt transmitter

192
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,303
And at 6 p.m. on the night of November 2nd 1920

193
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,119
The newly-licensed station KDKA

194
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
When on the air

195
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
It is

196
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
KD

197
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,543
The Westinghouse electric and Manufacturing Company

198
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
East Pittsburgh Pennsylvania

199
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
We shall now broadcast the election

200
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
The station launched

201
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,039
I broadcasting the returns at the Harding Cox presidential election

202
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
Luna recordings about broadcast

203
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
But in the late 1930s

204
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,439
Original announcer via Rosenberg

205
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Maidthis Recreation

206
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,327
We'd appreciate it if anyone hearing this broadcast would communicate with us

207
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,911
We are very anxious to know how far the broadcast is reaching

208
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
And how it is being received

209
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:26,335
Well nobody's ever heard of such a thing before you had to wait till next day to find out who won the election

210
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,151
Henry Mills who is 13 by this time

211
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,991
Remembers going down to the local newspaper where they had set up a receiving station

212
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,903
Somebody would sit at the receiver and a crowd gathered outside or number of people and they would watch TV

213
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,231
Returns being updated as the numbers came in bigger

214
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:48,095
The next day in the newspaper of course the talk was G for the first time

215
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,959
Ever people were able to get the reports before the newspaper was printed

216
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
I think it's very difficult for us

217
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
Today to imagine

218
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
Really quite what a magical moment this was

219
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:05,247
Susan Douglas is a professor at the University of Michigan and the author of inventing American Broadcasting

220
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,063
She says the KDKA election broadcast

221
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
What's a watershed event

222
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,415
And because there were no connecting wires because

223
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,975
There was a concept of The Ether

224
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,047
It was kind of a cosmic connection for people with a

225
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,911
Quasi sort of spiritual event that these voices were coming out of the air

226
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
Into your home

227
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:31,615
In 2 weeks after that first transmission Westinghouse introduced the first radio for the General Public

228
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,687
The areola Junior book sold for $25

229
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,759
The broadcasting boom have a gun

230
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
And over the next few years

231
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,343
Radio with move out of the garage

232
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
And into the living room

233
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,023
KDKA Pittsburgh

234
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,143
Today KDKA is considered the oldest radio station in the country

235
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:01,311
History has not been as kind to Frank Conrad's garage

236
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,455
This fall bulldozers began to clear the site it will soon be a Wendy's

237
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,271
The bulldozers destroy Conrad's house

238
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,599
But Rick Harrison a group of supporters called the Conrad project

239
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
Manage to save the garage

240
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
Piece by piece

241
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,791
The woodwork all of the doors the windows and some 25

242
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,375
Thousand or so bricks the ones that

243
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,167
Survived anyway

244
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
I don't know it's it's just

245
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,799
The more I learn about Frank Conrad and what he did and

246
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,383
The fact that he was virtually unknown outside of Pittsburgh

247
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
Just something

248
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,271
It feels that he's been overlooked for what he did

249
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,599
Sunday Harrah's hope to reconstruct Conrad garage

250
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
And turn it into a museum

251
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,071
Frank Conrad may have helped to launch the modern broadcasting industry

252
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
But that wasn't really his vision

253
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,215
Connect Bluetooth to talented engineer cancri late at night in his garage

254
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
Trying to connect to people through the air

255
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,615
And that pretty well describes what 94 year old Harry Mills is still doing

256
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
Every night at 10

257
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:15,039
Nobody won UEFA here is gay for each you thank you. Yes I'm reading you very well

258
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,111
After all this time

259
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,439
Caramel says he still feels the same way he felt

260
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
When he first heard Frank Conrad's voice

261
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Coming out of the radio

262
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
To me it's

263
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,863
It's difficult to describe the fascination of it

264
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
I know I use it all the time

265
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
How does it happen

266
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
Can see the father

267
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
No wires going from here to there

268
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
You can talk to him

269
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,479
It was a phenomenal it interested me from the beginning

270
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
Hey I presume it safe

271
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
To say that that is

272
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135

273
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463

A good night Bob and goodnight guy that what you want to see RFK 4hu

277
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:21,855
Conrad's garage was produced by Joe Richmond of radio Diaries in 2001 the lost and found sound series

278
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,695
Terry Mills who was featured in that piece died in 2008

279
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:32,095
Conrad garage is still a pile of loose bricks in storage awaiting its final resting place as a museum

280
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Someday

281
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
You'll be able to see it for yourself

282
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:46,175
The podcast part of radiotopia

283
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967

00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
This American Life and Planet Money

285
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,111
Richmond offhandedly said to me when we were talking about Today Show

286
00:15:54,623 --> 00:16:00,767
We'll see if you promoting the radio Diaries podcast on 90% invisible will result in more radio Diaries

And I would put it on a wrist watch band

366
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,055

I live out in the country

436
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
Originally I came from the city and

437
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
I kind of miss it

438
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,288
I was wondering if you would record some sounds of the city and

439
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
Send them out

440
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848

00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,712
Part of my answer was recorded in Time Square

00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:53,344
Last week later

444
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
I found this

445
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
In my mailbox

451
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,448

00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,728

00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
8:30 at night

455
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,688
The voices in music of the world came into my apartment in New York City

456
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,248

Used to be the people vendors going Bryan Street

Poor people singing in the backyard or shouting in the backyard

464
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Now

465
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,480
It's over the radio

466
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
Or television

467
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,600

469
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,864

487

498
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,528
Well I'm going to apply this technique

499
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,552

Palisades

513
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,992
I would record the sound of my daughter growing up

514
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
I have

515
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,856
Her first cries after being born

516
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,696
I had a microphone over her bed

517
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,512
On a recorder than our bedroom

518
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:19,168
Anytime I heard her beginning to wake up or anything I could turn on the recorder and record the sound of

519
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
Waking up

520
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008

He doesn't do it again he's houseboat

527
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,464
What do you think of the Russian sending the dog up in the satellite

528
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488

529
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512

Take her out to get a cab to go up to Harlem

536
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,480
If she's hella cab they wouldn't stop for her

537
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,528
Blacks couldn't get taxis

538
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:13,440
And I interviewed cabs drivers why they don't like to go to Harlem and put that in the program

539
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
It's all girls

00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,000
Peace and friendship with our great wartime allies

621
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536

Hollywood 10 was supposed to go to jail for being on American

632
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,816

Infiltration

634
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:14,496

642
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
Most people think of

643
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Evil

644
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,400
As the sounds of

645
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:46,752
Gunfire or thunder or lightning of something

646
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,312

00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,128
I believe that's the most evil sounds

648
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:56,992
The world are the sounds out of mouths of people

649
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,768
I've used media

650
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,816
To shame people

651
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,376
Into proper behavior

652
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,960
Primitive cultures

653
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:22,336
If someone did something shameful and word-of-mouth got around

654
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
The Village

655
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,944

Give divine

659
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,904
Distance of our country into the speed of sound

660
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,024
If I knew would take a 64th of a second to reach across the country

671
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,472

Denver Broncos horse

673
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:34,272
These are the stakes to make a world in which

674
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:40,672
We must either love

675
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,000
Or we must die

676
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,584
What would you say to young people who smoke

677
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,680
