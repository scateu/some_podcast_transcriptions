I couldn't figure it out

32
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
Sitting on Olive Street

33
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,856
This is a Napoleon

34
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
She's a writer

35
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,208
And when she moved from Chicago to San Francisco

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,512
She didn't know who to hit on anymore

37
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,840
Midwestern career culture is extremely different

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
Agriculture

39
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,192
And one of the things that

40
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216
Was most noted

41
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,752
Supposed to mean what

42
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Fashion

43
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
Some of the queer signals for the Midwest

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
Didn't quite hold

45
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
Like plaid flannel shirts

46
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,760
In the Midwest

47
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Or so I think

48
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
If you are part of a group

49
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,416
There are things you can wear or ways you can style your hair

50
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,976
Show that you are part of that group

51
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
Final is one of my eye to signify

52
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
I exist

53
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,496
But you can't really stop other people from wearing these signals and So eventually the power of that signal gets diluted

54
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,544
If you see someone wearing plaid now

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Thank you

56
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
Well I might

57
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
First Bank are you on by

58
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:33,344
And then the next thing you know you can't even tell what clothing is signaling what anymore

59
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
Redbox

60
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
Bye

61
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
Best Straight lady

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
And I got

63
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Obsessive that at

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
Outside bendik

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
About hipsters

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Working class culture motifs

67
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
And

68
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Flannel

69
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,544
Like lesbians are appropriating

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
Working class wear

71
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,408
So that's an interesting I don't know who actually owns

72
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,200
Phone

73
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
Articles of Interest a show about what

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,304
We wear until maybe the ideas about quotes about class

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,704
Piece of cloth

76
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Where's clothes

77
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,312
But if you ain't got the attitude install the carried off

78
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,128
Manual defect clothes.

79
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
Lumberjacks wear plaid

80
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,968
Punks were plaid mini skirts

81
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
The Beach Boys

82
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
I kid you not

83
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
Used to be called the pendletones

84
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,624
Applied with their surfboards

85
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,208
So many different groups have adopted plaid

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,512
So it almost doesn't mean anything anymore

87
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Really

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
Why are we all wearing this

89
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
This particular pattern

90
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,544
Which Once Upon a Time was mostly concentrated in the upper corner of this one Island

91
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
Off the coast of Europe

92
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
Set me for Coughlin distress

93
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
Precious thing

94
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,272
Identifies people in Scotland address as well

95
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,832
This is Peter McDonald historian at the

96
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
Scottish tartans Authority

97
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,672
They call this pattern tartan

98
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
Not

99
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Plaid

100
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,744
We don't use that word

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
For patents

102
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
In this country

103
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
Platies a goblin

104
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,143
The Scotsman who lived in the highlands

105
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,703
The northern hilly part of the country

106
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,263
Used to wrap themselves in a cloth

107
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
Almost like a blanket

108
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
Kind of like an Indian sari

109
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,967
So if you like it's a top and sorry will be the nearest equivalent

110
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
Was called a plaid

111
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
It had a Tartan pattern

112
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
On it got into the US

113
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,183
And that way they become synonymous with the patent

114
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
It's not like

115
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,279
Back Then There Were Tartan shirts and Tartan scarves

116
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
No Tartan was on

117
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
These traditional plaids

118
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
Overcoats

119
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
And on the traditional pants

120
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,495
Which were called Truth

121
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,567
Tripping out tries it cuz it's the types include the feet

122
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
So that more like

123
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
Ladies tights

124
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
She knows what kind of this parochial little pattern but Scotsman in the country used to where it was pretty

125
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:15,391
Pretty much only used on these obscure traditional Highlands garments that I had never heard of before

126
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
And then something happened

127
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Something that would

128
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,535
End up turning Tartan loose on the world

129
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,863
These obscure traditional Highland close

130
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
Warband

131
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
The ACT

132
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
Band

133
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Are kilts

134
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:36,127
Plants and other elements of Highland dress and outdoor coats in top nekot where is well

135
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,455
Donald is talking about is the dress Act of 1740

136
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,039
Scotland was being taken over by the head of Aryan Empire

137
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
How many of the Scots

138
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
Subaru Outback

139
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
We're from the Highlands

140
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
And so they wore Tartan coats

141
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
And Kilts and plaids

142
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
21 Pilots

143
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
They would be seen as terrorists

144
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
Open fights depending on which side you wrong

145
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
But that's the reason

146
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Forbade

147
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,679
It was a way to suppress the resistance

148
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
By limiting what they wore

149
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:07,359
Then we're not allowed to wear Highland clothes for 35 years in Scotland

150
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
But here's the thing

151
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,247
Just like banned books become the cool thing to read

152
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
When Scottish close or band

153
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:21,951
They became the cool thing to wear

154
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
This is Jonathan Ferris author of the book

155
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
Tartan

156
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
He says what the band did

157
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
Was that it made Highland closed

158
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
Trendy outside of Scotland

159
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
Suddenly

160
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,519
Tartan was also being worn in England

161
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,919
Meytal in the fashionable time break it was no longer a sign all indigenous Highlanders

162
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:47,295
Linda's all English people with special sympathy started the way

163
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,855
But Scottish man had an option

164
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:54,207
If they wanted to keep wearing their traditional clothes during the band

165
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
There was a loophole

166
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
They can go fight for the British Empire the band didn't apply to Scotsman who join

167
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:08,287
It encouraged people if they wanted to continue until

168
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,335
Age of God to join the military

169
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:16,735
Scotsman wearing tartans were deployed around the world which influence the style and popularity

170
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,063
Similar-looking patterns across the colonies

171
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,463
Like mattress in India

172
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
Maasai warriors

173
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,887
The colonialism of the British empire spread these influences around and increased Global demand for tart

174
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
And Tartan like Fabrics

175
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
The presence of Highland

176
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:44,127
Regimental soldiers wearing Tottenham son fulmore.

177
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,783
And meanwhile people in England with Scottish sympathies all got together in 1778 and made it kind of

178
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
Booster group

179
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,855
The advocate for Scottish culture

180
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:59,231
Some people the hottest sahib London was formed in order to try and preserve customs and manners

181
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:05,631
What was called the Highland Revival decline Revival they were responsible for the repeal of the

182
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
Site to 1782

183
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,239
Has finally lifted

184
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
It was just like

185
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:15,615
Tartan media the great Island Revival was in full swing

186
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
Scottish soldiers were coming home and now they could wear their Tartan and Englishmen were wearing Tartan and people

187
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,063
All over the colonies are wearing tartan

188
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
And North American

189
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,671
We're really wearing tartan

190
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231
Obviously the kind of work shows

191
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
That you would

192
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,095
Particularly identify with American Oceanside a kind of plant working shirt

193
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
If you got back some of the earliest clothes

194
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,263
What we used full of tomatoes what shows was exported from Scotland

195
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,335
Tartan became a massive export to the United States

196
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Top was a huge exports

197
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,711
To America in the 1700 early 1800

198
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
In the United States

199
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,807
Tartan was also a symbol of Heritage and belonging

200
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
If you were

201
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
Scotsman

202
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
Who was made to flee your Homeland

203
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,975
Or if you literally belong

204
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
To a Scotsman

205
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,119
Lots of very powerful squishies family is very active in the slave trade

206
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
These kinds of records are hard to find

207
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,495
But it said that enslaved people across the colonies

208
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,799
Also wore Tartan pattern cloth

209
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Because

210
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Tartan is bright

211
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Unnoticeable

212
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:26,015
Slaves would be made to wear a cloth with a particular tartan

213
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
Which side who they belong to

214
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,135
You looking malty would be branded by you

215
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Cognos bi or presses

216
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
We sprayed shooting

217
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:38,047
But he said needful those people was very much. Cost of Oppression

218
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
Tartan has been in many ways

219
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
A cloth of Oppression

220
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
But the Scots were being oppressed

221
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Themselves or acting is

222
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
And the British Empire

223
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
Or perpetuating the global slave trade

224
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,615
And it functions efficiently as a

225
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:58,015
The clock of Oppression because it is so loud and highly visible

226
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
Negating the body

227
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,879
I'm becoming literally just the patent so you are literally Honda

228
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Becoming the brand

229
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,999
Antarctica can be a brand of so many different conflicting things

230
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
In the United States

231
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,935
Tartan can be a nod to a rugged Highlander

232
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,007
Who's running around maybe looking out free sheet Monday wearing a kilt

233
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:24,127
La Monarca colonizer

234
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Frequently used home

235
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
I think it is probably

236
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,015
Associated with ideas of colonialism in Empire

237
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:35,391
And that's aside from its associations with queerness or Lumberjacks or Cowboys are bike Messengers

238
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
Quite literally

239
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
There's a tartan

240
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
For everything

241
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,071
Dee Williams work

242
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
The national records of Scotland

243
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
In these boxes

244
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Ikea

245
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
And she is showing me

246
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,263
The Scottish register of tartans

247
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
Which is very much not

248
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
Open to the public

249
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
How often does someone

250
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Come to

251
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
You are the first

252
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,039
She said I was the first journalist to have been in there

253
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Office

254
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
We don't say that

255
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
People coming in

256
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:12,767
Anybody can look online by the way they can look up if Peterson online did not register they just need to put in a

257
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,327
Search they just need to put in a name and it will come back

258
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,423
Curtains traditionally have been associated with Scottish names

259
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,519
So if your last name is McClain or McAllen or hannie

260
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,823
You can look up the traditional tartans

261
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
Associated with your clan

262
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
I had to the clan chief

263
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,479
Talk to David Henrie came in today

264
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
And he was looking at these tiny titans

265
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:41,695
Everyone who lives in Scotland has a long family history with a traditional last name and a family tartan

266
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:46,303
Scotland people wear Tartan Kilts to weddings

267
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,655
What are you supposed to wear if you're not from a clan

268
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
That's where you get out of

269
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
People that got Personal Touch

270
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,823
Sentinel Titans for designs

271
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:03,199
They really want it just for then you've also got organization corporate ones

272
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,015
Lots of military ones being registered lately

273
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,855
No matter who you are or how not Scottish you are

274
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,439
I will bet money but if you peruse the register of tartans

275
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,511
You will eventually find a Tartan for

276
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
Something

277
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
That you like or can identify with

278
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
The Zoo panda

279
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,447
Panda at the Edinburgh Zoo have a tartan

280
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,775
It's still just as tartan

281
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
But it's black and white

282
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,615
So these are some hairdos

283
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,151
Kaiser San Francisco

284
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:38,271
I won the San Francisco Tartan is Sandy and Scarlett like the colors of the 49ers

285
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,855
New Jersey Trenton is a sand and

286
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Blue and

287
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,511
Splendor bits of red states in the US have an official tartan

288
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,607
A lot of countries have won Zimbabwe new Zimbabwe

289
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,143
Kenya

290
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
Oh wow this is the Africa folder

291
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,775
Volkswagen American Express and Coca-Cola have tartans

292
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
Nike have a couple

293
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:07,199
And there's a Tartan for the Scottish register of tartans

294
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,039
You too can have your very own official tartan

295
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,343
Death certificate cost 70 lb

296
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,903
And it's $100 if you want it in a wooden frame

297
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
But you'll get the tattoo name you'll get the registration number you can design your own Tartan and literally 10 minutes

298
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,143
Because official tartans don't have to be cloth anymore

299
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:35,103
You can go to any number of online Tartan generators

300
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
Business Club

301
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,967
And import the colors you want to use power and the thread count

302
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,063
And tell you the tartan

303
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
Saving my tartan

304
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
You'll get tan people design Utah

305
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Dog

306
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
You know all their dead relative

307
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
Drinking why

308
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:58,399
Our historian friend Peter McDonald is part of the committee that assesses the incoming tartans

309
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
Theater on 8th

310
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:06,079
Proposal

311
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,175
And I wish doesn't make them good or tasteful or meaningful frankly

312
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:15,551
I mean to do some of these Titans get denied of the new incoming tartans

313
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
The majority of them

314
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
Arnott from Scotland

315
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,183
Top of my head 70% come from North America

316
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,487
Probably knows from the US by size

317
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
Portion from

318
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Cottages Wells

319
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:31,167
Quite a few from Japan little Japanese school seems like top of the uniforms.

320
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
But yeah the majority of income from America

321
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
America is really

322
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
Into tartan

323
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,407
I mean just go to New York City on April 6th

324
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
What's National Tartan day

325
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
And they put on this huge parade with bagpipes

326
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,343
Scottish Terriers and Scottish associations from all over the US

327
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,719
Harden is one way that white people can claim some sort of cultural heritage

328
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:01,119
Because you're young country you all want to play in your heritage and actually a lot of people play me that

329
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
Scots-irish ancestry

330
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
Because it has

331
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,239
The cultural icons by dent

332
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,287
Which help you belong

333
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,103
And everyone wants to belong

334
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
2 something

335
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
Somewhere somehow

336
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,991
There's about a 30% increase last year Thomas register

337
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,063
Is it definitely increase

338
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
In some ways

339
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,903
If you don't get your Tartan actually woven

340
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:29,023
The register of tartans might seem like a Cheesy thrill like one of those online services where you can

341
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
Pay to register a star

342
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
Or buy a plot of land on the Moon

343
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
But those authentic Clan tartan

344
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,751
The ones that represent last name

345
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,311
Those were also kind of made of

346
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
When you look

347
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
Actually I believe

348
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
Examples of

349
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:49,759
Surviving talton's it would not really have been associated with particular families

350
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
And there is no way that

351
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,135
612

352
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:00,511
This idea of official Clan tartans was part of a great Highland Revival

353
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
Gosh

354
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,607
Stop around speaking title

355
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
200 years is old

356
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,751
But that's nothing when you compare it to the ages of the Clans themselves

357
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,335
Raise the Macallan

358
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,151
Those are closer to 1000 years old

359
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,455
But basically in the 1800's

360
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,295
Many of the clan leaders just went and picked out tartans they liked

361
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
And we named them after themselves

362
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,671
Is it kind of like what's your favorite absolutely

363
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
No Campbell Chiefs

364
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:36,095
Used Blackhawks shopping as a cheese and Kenzie use the 70s.

365
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
Atlanta

366
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
That's awesome that

367
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,727
Can you tell you've been being sold as Caledonia

368
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
Tartan plaid

369
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
Whatever you want to call it

370
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,407
How many different meanings and associations

371
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,967

Pattern seems simple

376
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
It's a series of overlapping threads

377
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
A warp and weft

378
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Really

379
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559

Skirts

449
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,423
But there's is one important way that Kilts are very similar

450
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,471
To womenswear what are you wearing right now

451
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,287

00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Jurassic Park

458
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:11,295
This is David McPherson who I met outside a bar in Edinborough

459
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
And when he wears his Kilt

460
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,647
He also has to wear something called a

461
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
Warren

462
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184

Terrible

471
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,824
Because Kilts don't have any pockets

472
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
So

473
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,920
