Jean Greenspan is my father's mother I call her Grandma Jeanie

35
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:29,856
She grew up during the Great Depression and because her family got a lot of help from FDR and the New Deal

36
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,648
Grandma Jenny is a Democrat

37
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
Always has been always will be

38
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
Grandma have you ever voted for a Republican or anyone who wasn't a Democrat

39
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
Never never never do that

40
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168
Always vote for Democrats

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,824

Kubota straight Democratic ticket

45
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528

49
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
And what county do you live

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Palm Beach County

51
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,304
An election in turmoil

52
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
A presidency in the Bala

53
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,424
Who will emerge the winner in the historic Florida recount

54
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,216
I believe the people of Palm Beach

55
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
Which county

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Have entrusted us

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
To voice their right

58
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
Pate and their governor

59
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Time moves

60
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
Disboards

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,688
Conduct a manual recount of all the ballots with

62
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
Presidential elect

63
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,808
The election was close

64
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
But tonight after account

65
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,696
And yet another manual recount secretary and I are honored and humbled

66
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
The one the state of Florida

67
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,816
Which gives us needed electoral votes

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
As a quick refresher the 2000 presidential race between Republican George W bush and Democrat Al Gore

69
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
14 down two contested

70
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
What's in Florida

71
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,384
And one of the four counties at the center of the controversy with Palm Beach County

72
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:02,016
Voters were using paper ballots where you indicate your choice by punching out holes with a metal stick

73
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,416
Palm Beach County's ballot known as the butterfly ballot had choices of candidates spread over two pages with the hoe

74
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
The punch out in between them

75
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
But some found a layout confusing

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,424
Voters who wanted to cast their vote for George W bush had no problem it was clear that the correct hole to punch

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
Was the very first

78
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
Right at the top

79
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:27,104
But there is some ambiguity about which was the right hole to punch to indicate a vote for Al Gore

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,408
Was it the second one down right after bush

81
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
Or was it the third one down

82
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,504
Gore was actually the third one

83
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
The way the ballot was set up some voters who believe they were voting for Al Gore actually cast a vote for Patrick bikini

84
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,512
Buchanan being extremely conservative Reform Party candidate

85
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,840
And there's also a problem with the physical balance themselves

86
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
Namely

87
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
The chat

88
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
When you punch a hole in something the Chad is the little piece of paper or cardboard of whatever it is that gets punched out

89
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,384
And in theory it should be completely punch out but sometimes it

90
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
This doesn't happen

91
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
Sometimes the Chad's hang on

92
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
In the case of the 2000 election

93
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,296
If the Chad was still hanging on

94
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,624
The ballot counting machine couldn't always read the ballot

95
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,208
And for the people who would eventually count them by hand in the recount

96
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
The auditors

97
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
Had to interpret

98
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
The intent of the voter

99
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,143
And the hanging Chads

100
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Became

101
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
White Infamous as well because

102
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
INRI tabulating the vote

103
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
You had to make

104
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
Assumptions about whether a hanging chad

105
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,407
Was a vote for a particular candidate

106
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Or

107
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
It was a mistake

108
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
That's Eric Heron Mine is Eric Heron and I'm the Everly family professor of political science at West Virginia University

109
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Varsity

110
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,023
And I focus my research on elections electoral systems and so because of this faulty ballot in Palm Beach County

111
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
My grandma Jeannie

112
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,911
A dyed-in-the-wool new deal Democrat from the Jewish tenements of New York City

113
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,495
Might have accidentally endorsed a third-party candidate

114
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
Who Embraces all the things that

115
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
And then we were told

116
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
I was really

117
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Embarrass

118
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
We felt cheated we felt guilty

119
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
I felt guilty

120
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
That I voted for the wrong person

121
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,343
Retirement community Century Village

122
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,927
Was actually called out by salon.com and other news Outlet

123
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,511
Has pulling unusually high for Pat Buchanan

124
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,327
There is extensive research to show that

125
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
The votes cast for Buchanan

126
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
In Palm Beach County

127
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
Extraordinarily High

128
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,519
They were anomalous in

129
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
The region

130
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Engine

131
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,127
And the best explanation

132
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
4

133
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,967
The spike in support for Patrick Buchanan

134
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
Was the design of the ballot

135
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,879
Even Pat Buchanan himself admitted that his high numbers were probably due to an error

136
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:52,767
Now the butterfly ballot was only one small piece of the debacle that was the 2000 election in

137
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Florida

138
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
Absentee ballot

139
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,679
Counted incorrectly there was a manual recount of a started and then stopped

140
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:05,055
And later it would come out of the state of Florida wrongfully denied the right to vote to at least

141
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,847
12000 people

142
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,919
A disproportionate number of whom or people of color

143
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,503
All of this in an election where the margin of victory was

144
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
Fewer than six

145
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
100 volt

146
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
There were a number of incidents

147
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
In Florida in

148
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
2000 election

149
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
That were

150
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Politically charged

151
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
And

152
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Potentially

153
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
Motivated bipartisan in

154
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,839
But the design of the butterfly ballot

155
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
Is much more likely

156
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,911
A case of malpractice

157
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
Zayn Malik

158
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,751
It was a classic design fail

159
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,799
It's a poorly designed

160
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
Valid it is a ballad

161
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,639
That does not take into account

162
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
The way that a voter

163
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
Would look at the balance

164
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
And

165
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,551
Use the particular technology

166
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,855
In place at the time punch card technology

167
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
Decoster

168
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:57,535
The ballot is a designed object that is critically important for democracy but in the United States it's almost

169
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,863
Never designed by an actual design professional

170
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
And as such

171
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,007
Are Liberty is being infringed upon by the tyranny of bad design

172
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:14,687
One of the oldest recorded instances of a vote is from the ancient Greek play the eumenides by aeschylus

173
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,271
In the story arrestees is on trial for the murder of his mother

174
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,927
12 jurors line up and take turns placing a stone in One

175
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
Signify not guilty

176
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,279
And there's no teeth of the stone as a marker of a vote

177
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
It's an image that stuck and the Greek word

178
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,423
Sephos which means small stone or pebble

179
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Is the root

180
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
ABS apology

181
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
Or the study of election

182
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,847
And as Eric Heron tells it himself a psephologist

183
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:49,503
The whole Stone in the urn setup was not too different than how elections in the United States

184
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,599
So in the early us elections you will find voters

185
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:59,999
Casting a Voice vote they physically had to make their way to the polling place and announce their vote and one of the things

186
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,607
Things you do sacrifices the privacy of your vote individuals know who you are voting for

187
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,703
And what that can engender is pressure on voters to support

188
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,239
One candidate or another

189
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:16,639
In the polls were not calm places with orderly lines you could be battered and pressured into voting a certain way

190
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
Burley elections in the United States often featured

191
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
Liquor and violence

192
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
And fraud

193
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
Voters would have to

194
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,183
Push or shove or be physical to express

195
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
There

196
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Right to vote

197
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
In fact an election could be so rock is it served as an argument for some against women's suffrage

198
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,239
Elections were deemed inappropriate for women

199
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
Then in the late 1800s

200
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:50,431
Election supervisors realize that having people by speaking their choices allowed was a terrible idea

201
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
The lack of privacy could lead to coercion

202
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,087
And had no way to verify that their vote

203
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
Is being recorded accurately

204
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Called a ticket

205
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
But unlike a ballot we have today

206
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,839
These were printed not by the government but by political parties

207
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
Political parties would print

208
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
Their own ballot

209
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,983
That voters would take with them to the polling

210
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:20,639
Now these could be printed in newspapers that could be printed by the parties themselves and distributed

211
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
And

212
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
The voter would turn in that party ticket

213
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,295
The party tickets with generally only have the candidates

214
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,391
From that party on them so if say you wanted mostly Republicans

215
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,975
You go get a Republican party ticket and then you cross out the

216
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
The candidates that you don't want

217
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
And then either write in

218
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,351
Or literally cut and paste

219
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
Pieces of paper with your kids names

220
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
Onto that ticket

221
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,983
And this is the origin of the

222
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Term

223
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,287
The cast of split ticket

224
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
Or a Straight Talk

225
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,871
But this system also had problems

226
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,223
1 parties could make tickets that look like those of their opponents

227
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
But actually had their own candidates listed

228
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
Duping voters into voting for the wrong party

229
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,671
Non-standard ballets also created other opportunities for shenanigans

230
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
Like racketeering scheme

231
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,047
Which facilitated a whole Black Market of buying and selling votes

232
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Answer the party ticket system

233
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,447
Wasn't creating Fair elections either in the late 19th century there is

234
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:21,567
An innovation that is imported from abroad is called the Australian ballot

235
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
The Australian ballot

236
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Is

237
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
Government printed ballot

238
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,247
That is distributed to voters who come to a polling place

239
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
And they

240
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Cast their ballot

241
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
In

242
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:37,183
Private and this Australian ballot system was a game-changer

243
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,231
First of all we started treating ballots

244
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
More like currency

245
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
Administrator

246
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
How to store them securely

247
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:49,471
Store them safely they have to maintain a clear chain of custody over them to maintain the

248
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Integrity

249
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
Of the election prop

250
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,823
They're often printed on special paper

251
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
To undermine counterfeiting

252
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Or efforts to

253
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Nick fraud

254
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,807
And with the Australian ballot as a Point of Departure polling places in the US began to see new machines the interface

255
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
With the official government printed ballot

256
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,415
They were machines where you pull levers

257
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,231
Or use a metal rod to punch holes out of an object

258
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,351
Will scan ballot like we saw with a butterfly ballot in Palm Beach County Florida in the two Thousand Eleven

259
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,167
There is tremendous variation

260
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
It how each County conducts

261
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
It's elections

262
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:27,103
If you move across the county line your polling place could use an entirely different balance

263
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,687
Because here's the really crazy thing about elections

264
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
The US

265
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
Unlike much of Western Europe

266
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Haneda

267
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,087
Australia South Africa India

268
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
Most other industrialized democracies

269
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:44,767
Do u.s. runs elections at a hyper-local level because the US

270
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
Decentralized system

271
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Process

272
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
You have

273
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Patchwork

274
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
Of election procedures

275
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
All across the

276
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,983
And it can vary

277
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,055
At the county level or even within some count

278
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
How ballot

279
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
What are counted

280
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
And process

281
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,967
We do this because that's what the Constitution tells us to do

282
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,527
It says that states shall conduct elections

283
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,367
And the states generally delegate elections down to Municipal governments

284
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:15,231
Partly because voters have so many things to vote for that each municipal government

285
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
Why are zits on ballet

286
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
We vote

287
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
4

288
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
So many

289
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
Public officials

290
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
Everything from president

291
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
Drain commissioner

292
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
Can be on a ballot

293
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,079
Yeah michigan-michigan you can vote for County drain commissioner

294
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:36,479
And so given that each county is responsible for running its own elections every county is on their own naked

295
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,015
Hire a designer to make a balance

296
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,855
They could not hire designer to make the ballot it all depends on

297
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,671
What each elections official wants to do

298
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
And that more than malicious intent

299
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:51,327
Maybe how Grandma Jeannie and her elk voted for the wrong guy in mm

300
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,631
Exactly Pat Buchanan is

301
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
Religious Fundamentalist

302
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Kind of guy

303
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,287
Not the sort of person that a bunch of Jewish grannies are going to be voting for

304
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
Guess you had tested out this ballot in the kind of pilot test or run what we call usability test even with just a

305
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
A few people that this

306
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,039
Issue would have surfaced pretty quickly

307
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,367
That's Dana chisnell she is a user experience design

308
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,159
And I do

309
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Applied research

310
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
Design in folding Cadillac

311
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:25,887
Dana along with her colleague Whitney Quisenberry with the center for civic design have made it their mission

312
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,935
Design theory and practice

313
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Two elections

314
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,799
In election Administration usability testing

315
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
Get done

316
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,127
Pilot testing on these kinds of designs

317
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Doesn't get

318
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,711
Sodick co-authored a set of

319
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,015
Field guides to ensuring voter intent

320
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,575
Design manual for elections official

321
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,879
And the very first one in the series

322
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,439
Was how to design usable ballads

323
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,767
So whatever recommendations is use lowercase letters

324
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,351
Mixed case print is just easier to read

325
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,399
This is actually been proven in studies

326
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:03,263
We also say avoid Center type type is for wedding invitations in Wind Lake

327
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,055
It really doesn't belong

328
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
On a form

329
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
Especially when like this

330
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,175
Other recommendations include using

331
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
Type in New York

332
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
In 2012 I think

333
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
In about

334
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,135
It's not uncommon to find magnifying glasses

335
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
In New York voting booth

336
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:25,535
The center for civic design also recommends using one sans-serif font

337
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,375
If you look at some of these balance their kind of a they look like Ransom notes

338
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,703
There are lots of different type families that are used

339
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
The whole thing

340
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Screaming at

341
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,383
We can, that down quite a bit by just going with one

342
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
San serif

343
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:48,063
The suggestion to the guide books for how to design a good ballot are akin to designing a good anything

344
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,367
When designers get ahold of these things are like

345
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
This is design 101

346
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
But election officials don't know this

347
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,583
And election officials unlike normal client

348
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,703
Often have to uphold legislation requiring them to use bad design

349
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
If you go look at election code

350
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
In practically every state

351
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Thing

352
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
Design of the ballot is largest

353
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,223
What's a typeface is what size it should be what the grid is

354
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
Bad designs

355
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
Almost

356
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:26,207
Almost exclusively by Design officials have to apply better design principles to there

357
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,279
They also need to change laws

358
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,607
But one thing that might solve ballots for good is standardizing

359
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,471
It's actually a project with Dana chisnell and the center for civic design are also working on

360
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,543
They built a prototype called the anywhere about

361
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,615
It's a touch screen system where you can resize text

362
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
Adjust contrast navigate easily

363
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:51,295
Verify that you voted for human to vote for and it's open source so any elections official can use it

364
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
13 is quick to admit

365
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,159
Probably won't eliminate all forms of a

366
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,487
Will something always goes wrong I just hope that it

367
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
Will not

368
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
