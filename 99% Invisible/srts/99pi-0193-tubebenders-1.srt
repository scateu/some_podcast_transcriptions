I'm Roman Mars

30
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
Downtown Oakland where we work

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,056
Is beautiful

32
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,872
But it doesn't cut a very distinct Skyline

33
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,200
Sure they're the cranes down by the port was a pretty face

34
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,760
But in terms of Downtown Oakland proper

35
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,344
It's pretty much just one building that defines the night-time Skyline

36
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
The Tribune Tower

37
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,720
He used to be the headquarters of the newspaper the Oakland Tribune

38
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
Paper moved up the street

39
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,304
So now the tower is an office building

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
That's producer Avery trufelman

41
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,680
The Tribune Tower which happens to be our office

42
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
Was the tallest building in Oakland in the 1920s

43
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,800
The 22-story tower

44
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,896
Top of the copper coated pitched mansard roof and a Sandy brick exterior

45
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
Really unique architecture

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,016
But that is not why it's the most distinctive building in Oakland

47
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
It's famous because it says

48
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,880
Tribune in gigantic orange red neon letters

49
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
Side of the building

50
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,720
And each side has a neon clock

51
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
Whitney on hands

52
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
And it's always on

53
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
Every night

54
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Never flickering

55
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
Rarely the letter out

56
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,448
Because the Tribune neon has a secret weapon

57
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
On the top top floor

58
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
Of the Tower

59
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,080
Take the elevator to the 20th floor

60
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,128
There you'll see a door

61
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Limited access

62
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
There's a slight of nerve

63
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
Up the stairs

64
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,576
You'll find a man

65
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
John Law

66
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
The keeper

67

Avineon

68
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
We are on the 20

69
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,168
Second floor of the Oakland Tribune Tower

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
What type of tiny

71
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
Office space in one corner and

72
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,080
The current owners have a wonderful Ranger with them and you know

73
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616
Rent the place from them and I'll keep the

74
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
Neon signs going

75
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,480
Betrayed John Law is a sign installer and maintainer

76
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,808
And he is the one that keeps the Tribune Tower neon Blazer

77
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,416
Nowadays A wraparound neon clock on the 20th floor of a building is

78
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
Fairly rare

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
They're more in the 30s

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
4 days ago

81
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,584
Buildings with me with some signage on them in the n on the other almost all gone

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,216
The Tribune neon like many many neon signs and had periods of darkness and neglect

83
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,056
Most signed of the signs have been allowed to flicker out and die

84
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,616
But thanks to John and the owner of the Tower

85
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
The Tribune Neon

86
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,712
After a period of neglect has been on consistently

87
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
Since the late 90s

88
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,040
This is no small feat

89
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Back of one of the

90
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,952
Ford Flex

91
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,816
John can repair some of the neon from within the tower

92
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,656
What about to get out of the face work on the neon on the letters I have to clip into I've

93
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
Full body harness

95
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Step onto the face of a letter

96
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,288
Will a butt hanging over a drop

97
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,592
Drop of something like 300 feet

98
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
But John loves height

99
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
And he loves me on

100
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
Let me know what other light sources

101
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
I don't have that

102
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,832
Kind of fuzzy otherworldly look to it that you get with me on him

103
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,392
Neon signage you have to be very beautiful in a lot of

104
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:18,047
People in the past considered to be cheesy and ugly and representative of some dying commercialism that they found

105
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Unpleasant

106
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,143
People like philosophers SAS writing

Of late capitalism

109
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,519

Let you something if you're coming from the European background

124
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,423
It has a really kind of aesthetic power

125
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,287
It is a great metaphor of American culture even though it's not in the bag

126
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Product

127
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,455
Press the gas neon was discovered in 1898 by a British scientist named Sir William Ray

128
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
It was a new gas

129
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
So we named it for the Greek Neos

130
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Meaning new

131
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,439
Do you realize that if you run electricity through this new gas it would burn bright bright orange and red

132
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
But he basically said that school and then forgot about it moving on to find other gases and ultimately win a Nobel Prize

133
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,399
But Neon Lights as we know them

134
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
We're made and popularized by another account

135
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
Who is this

136
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Frenchman

137
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
Play around with these

138
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
Neon tubes

139
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:40,735
That was a pretty good at business man I thought well we could do something with us

140
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,295
Made his first neon lights in 1910

141
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,855
Eventually quit chemistry to start a business

142
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
Call the Clyde Neon

143
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
It was the first to sell this new lighting

144
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
For Decor in for advertising

145
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,303
The first neon signs were up in Paris

146
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
The barbershop

147
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,143
The first shop ever tap in the outside

148
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,727
And then really spread around the city of Paris from Paris

149
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:08,127
Spread around the world may have been the father of neon lights but he was not a good guy

150
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
Yeah it's hard to fall in love with them

151
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,991
You trying to tell an Ardent follower if not

152
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,831
Did Germany

153
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,135
But neon swept the United States

154
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,719
It was brighter and more efficient than incandescent lighting

155
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
Americans were giddy with it

156
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,351
By 1924 the company Claude Neon

157
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,679
Had franchises in 14 major cities across the country

158
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:36,543
By the 1930s there were 20000 neon advertisement in Manhattan and Brooklyn

159
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
Most of them

160
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
Made by Claude Neon

161
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
Neon signs were the embodiment

162
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
As Prospero

163
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,503
Sony on Amazon respectable upscale spots

164

Movie Palace March

165
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
Opera

166
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
Nice places

167
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,671
It started with the charges and the

168
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,255
Fender for stores and then the car dealerships

169
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,351
Institutions and signified became the symbol

170
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
Of life in the big city

171
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
Play 40s

172
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,751
Peggy Lee as a singer in those days she had a song

173
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,879
Adidas neon enthusiasm at that. But the initial excitement fades

174
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,183
The popularity of downtown Wayne

175
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
People move to the suburbs

176
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
Cities grow dark

177
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
The Neon

178
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Plickers

179
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
Years later turn 20 years down the road

180
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,191
Then it would take more cheap bars cheap hotels

181
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
And then

182
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
I have the CD

183
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Equality

184
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
And then by and by trying to

185
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
This metaphor

186
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,895
People who you know more less critique

187
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,455
Loneliness in society

188
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
Best out of country and western

189
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,583
Getting drunk by the neon sign

190
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:16,383
And sending me on which used to be assigned luxury trains and a symbol of poverty in the rundown City

191
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,735
Neon is also hard to maintain in a broken neon sign is a bright

192
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
Flashing sign a Brokenness

193
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
And that's why we came to symbolize

194
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Abdicate

195
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
Neon tubes are Madewell

196
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
They can last about 30 years

197
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
Sometimes up to 70

198
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
But they are glass

199
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
So they can break

200
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
And they're out there in the elements

201
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
The electricity can flicker out

202
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,007
What a neon sign goes out you can't just screw in a new tube or order up a cheap replacement

203
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
You would think

204
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,919
Like a machine made product right that there was some sort of big neon Factory that

205
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Just trying it out

206
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
Neon assembly line

207
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
And that's really not the case

208
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,343
30 Craftsman whose safety sign

209
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
The band The Tubes with their hands

210
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,767
That's really just one person doing this person like Shawna Peters

211
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,655
A neon glass blower is not a glass blower it's really called neon tube bending

212
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
That's the trade

213
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
42 Bender

214
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,543
Jonah Peterson has been bending since 1987

215
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
She says color is a good way to decode these signs to know what's inside of them and what quality they are

216
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
Are the most basic

217
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
And the most popular

218
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
And that's like a reddish orange

219
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
And that's the

220
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
Standard neon red

221
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
That is

222
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
Short Neon gas

223
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
Does naturally burn fat color

224
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,535
And then there's blue neon also pretty basic

225
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,935
The cool secret about blue neon is that is not actually Neon gas its Argon gas brightened with a little mercury

226
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,239
Bowie still called them neon signs

227
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,591
And for a while almost all neon signs were just red and blue

228
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
Pier neon or argon Mercury

229
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Clear tube

230
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,271
Then the industry came up with a way to make any color you want

231
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
There's a place for powder coating on the inside of the tube

232
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,487
Vendors can use tubes with different phosphorus on the inside of the tubes to create more colors than just red and blue

233
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,583
Use a fuchsia use a green a lime green go for lime green you know

234
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
Use of color

235
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
Dunwell is nice

236
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,775
Now just to be clear those neon beer signs at the bodega or the standard open sign

237
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
Candy and often are

238
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,127
Made on a massive scale in China

239
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,199
Those are still hand blown that's the only way to make neon

240
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:32,575
That's like one person makes only the letter e all day long another person makes

241
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Only owes

242
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
And these signs are lower quality

243
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,303
Cheap signs for beer brands or generic open signs are often color with a coating of color plastic on the outside

244
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
Side of the glass tubes

245
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,911
Usually it's so cheap you can chip it off with your fingernail

246
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:53,567
But if you're looking at a sign over your local bar or hotel or sometimes even a neon sign over a chainsaw

247
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
If it's

248
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
Large and you haven't seen it anywhere else

249
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
It was probably painstakingly crafted

250
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
Probably logo

251
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,343
Neon tube Benders get glass from the manufacturer and 4 ft long tubes

252
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,671
And they draw out a pattern for how the bend and fuse it

253
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
You're bending the word Apple you never start with a

254
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,047
You have to map out in your mind

255
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,703
Where those curves are and how they're going to change direction and generally going to start somewhere in the center of the

256
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
That word

257
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
And work your way out

258
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:27,103
Ishawna has a number of different burners and tools to manipulate the tubes

259
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:32,479
Bell curve to hold the glass tube on either end over an open flame burner

260
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,039
When I'm using it it sounds like this

261
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
Shawna has only

262
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
Few seconds

263
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
The Ben put glass into a perfect shape

264
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
Before it hardens up again

265
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
So she has to act quickly

266
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Imprecise

267
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
Sneezing is a tube benders

268
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,935
Nightmare Moon China processes the bed tubes with a machine called open barter

269
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
It's his whole process where he heats up the tubes really really hot and vacuumed out the impurities before filling the tubes with

270
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,127
Neon or argon Mercury

271
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,431
Infuses the electrical source to them

272
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,735
In Creed summary is the craft

273
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
Expensive

274
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
Difficult

275
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,111
And there aren't that many people who can make neon sign

276
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
And that is why

277
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:16,255
When they break that usually get replaced with LEDs

278
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
And

279
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:24,191
People in the LED industry will tell you it's so much brighter as well Randall and Homan and Albina are the publishers

280
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,983
And photographers of a book called

281
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
San Francisco Neon

282
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
Survivors and lost iPhone

283
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,663
All of these signs are part of our cultural heritage in San Francisco

284
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,551
Treasures we need to hang on to them Randall and Ali tours of some of their favorite neon around the

285
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
Many of the signs are defunct

286
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,463
For hangover businesses up there no longer affiliated with

287
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
This is my very favorite

288
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Sign

289
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,607
This article of peacock has no fewer than 17

290
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Concentric circles

291
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,959
Of neon and it's really a feet of tube bending

292
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,519
No the business is long gone

293
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
Kind of a miracle

294
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
But it's still here

295
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
San Francisco was once

296
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
Covered in neon

297
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,783
Look at an old picture of Market Street from the 1950s and you'll see it looks like the Vegas Strip

298
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
All aglow

299
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
Flashing lights

300
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:18,975
Then in the 60s there was a campaign to get rid of all that flash and beautify that part of town

301
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,047
Animals all those neon signs were removed

302
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,167
Around the rest of the city pretty regularly stops on Randall and Al's neon tour will just

303
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,311
Ventshade seats divorcing and awkward to bring it to a group around the corner to talk about a sign that

304
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,639
Doesn't exist anymore

305
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
Neon signs

306
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
If you're interested in photographing them or painting them

307
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
Do it as quick as you can because they can disappear overnight

308
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,087
And it's not just San Francisco

309
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:51,231
New York also went from having tens of thousands of signs in the 1970s to just a couple hundred today

310
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,815
Hong Kong is losing a lot of it's spectacular neon display

311
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Signs change

312
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
With their cities

313
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,703
But in some spheres neon is having a little Revival

314
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,031
If Union vendors around are getting a lot of business

315
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
From high-end restaurants in

316
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Hotels

317
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,151
Companies want quotes illuminated on their walls

318
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
Are artists who are commissioning me on pieces

319
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:16,063
Now a custom neon sign represents an emphasis on craftsmanship

320
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
InStyle

321
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,623
Tins with a bit of nostalgia

322
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,439
I'm sure this all sounds very artisanal and stuff

323
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,023
But this might just be the way that neon craft survive

324
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,095
At its core the ingredients are simple

325
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Glass

326
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Electricity

327
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
And gas from the air we breathe

328
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,263
Embedded into something

329
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Spectacular

330
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,391
99% invisible with Presa sweet by Avery trufelman with Katie mingle Sam Greenspan crew Kolstad and Mero

331
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:58,303
But Alexis week to Jim Rizzo of neon Works in Oakland and Tom Downs author of walking San Francisco

332
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,703
Randall and Alice Photography book San Francisco neon survivors and lost icons is now in its third printing

333
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,335
We are project 91.7 kalw San Francisco and produced at the offices of arcsin

Downtown Oakland California

336
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Between the beats

337
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
Bongs and Charter of our devices

338
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,903
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

339
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,535
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

340
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,351
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and

341
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,215
Voice technology talk to us

342
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,263
It is a creation of Sonic trap

343
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,335
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

344
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,919
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

345
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
To make them more human

346
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
Turn the living room lights on

347
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Okay

348
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
Dim the living room lights to 50

349
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
80%

350
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Okay

351
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:04,607
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

352
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
Makes for a much more natural

353
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Experience

354
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
Turn the living room lights on

355
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
Dim the living room lights to 50

356
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
2%

357
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:20,991
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

358
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
About how are sounds gay

359
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,063
Is impacting our health

360
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,367
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

361
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

362
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Right here

363
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
Npip

364
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
We need to talk about

365
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,399
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating
