Set float in the air

28
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,456
4 over 100 years lighter than air aircraft have fascinated us

29
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,832
I have this recurring starring role in our dreams of an alternate reality

30
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:34,464
Of a future that might have been where cargo and passenger is Traverse the globe

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
Civilized

32
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
MDOC elegantly

33
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,376
In the morning Towers on top of Art Deco skyscrapers

34
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:47,008
In real life it was likely a blimp emblazoned with the Goodyear logo

35
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:52,640
A blank is a non rigid Airship there's no structure inside the balloon is just a balloon

36
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
The shape is maintained by the pressure of the lifting gas inside then you had a little cockpit in engines and rudder

37
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:04,928
Outside that big balloon to make it Fly today's blimps are basically cute PR novelties

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,976
But for around 100 years

39
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,256
Lighter than air aircraft

40
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,352
We're seriously proposed as the Perfect Design solution

41
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
All kinds of problems

42
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,704
Even though none of these proposals actually happen

43
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
People just

44
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,520
Couldn't give up on the promise

45
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Veriship

46
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,384
In the 90s there was a company called sky station

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Play raise some

48
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,736
4.2 billion orally solicited it to put 205

49
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,552
50 + 10 equip the airships to deliver internet service

50
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
This is Bill Hamid

51
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,160
He's the engineer guy on YouTube and an Airship enthusiast

52
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:41,024
The 80s that was the British Antarctic Survey

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
Go to the South Pole

54
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
I'm so pretty soon enough professor

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,192
Suggested Tangled electrical wires

56
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:54,592
Zappos onedin chemicals in the seventies they were supposed to help developing nations using a hive

57
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,200
Hybrid blimp to Usher those nations in the 20th century no no need for roads they need

58
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,064
Railroads and tunnels and bridges which is to lift stuff in the 1950s and 60s

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
Nuclear powered airship

60
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,672
What's with unlimited energy and an unlimited capacity for work

61
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Propose

62
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,768
In the twenties and thirties they were to fulfill Imperial Ambitions both

63
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Germany

64
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
And the British

65
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
We're looking for that

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
Any Americans to

67
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,656
Imperial Ambitions in the Philippines

68
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,472
All those failed attempts to realize

69
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,008
Full potential of air show

70
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,080
It was those Imperial rigid airship

71
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
Have we developed in the 20s and 30s

72
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
That came the closer

73
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
To actually changing the world

74
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Airship

75
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
You have a metal frame

76
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,344
And the house has gas bags that lift this year

77
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,672
Those gasbags are arranged in the metal scaffolding like

78
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
Peas in a Peapod

79
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:47,584
And it'll cloth cover is stretched over that emmacloth cover is not airtight it protects the gas bags from weather

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
Underneath the fabric cover are not trust Gatsby

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
Because it's not a pressure vessel

82
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,008
They're able to build things inside the airship

83
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,312
Like crew quarters dining rooms lounges

84
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,616
All built into the metal framework

85
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:04,992
So people move around inside the thing that you might think of as the balloon but it's not really

86
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,088
Emmett structure enables an Airship to travel faster little blimp

87
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,928
Because the force of the wind for example with the form the nose of a blimp

88
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
And it also allows

89
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
The ship to be built much

90
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
Much bigger

91
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,399
You may be heard the term dirigible which is the French name for an airship

92
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Where is zeppelin

93
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
Which is a German company that makes airships

94
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,543
Zeppelin is like the kleenex or bandaid of the airship

95
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,383
The proper term is generic and boring as it sounds

96
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
Is air show

97
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
The most promising most

98
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,623
Opulent rigid Airship of its time 1920s here was Britain's r101 B are there

99
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
Stands for Ridgid

100
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:49,791
The rise and dramatic fall of Britain's last great Airship is the primary subject of Bill hammocks new book

101
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Call

102
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
Fatal

103
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Flight

104
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Weather alert

105
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
When it comes to the dream of airships dominating the sky's the catastrophic and very public Hindenburg disaster

106
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,175
May have been the final nail in the coffin

107
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
It was the crash of r101

108
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,271
That built the coffin

109
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,135
R101 was supposed to connect the global British Empire

110
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:19,231
Who designed to fly from London to Karachi in 5 days

111
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,791
That's 10 days faster than by sea

112
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
Taking a plane that distance

113
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
Took 16 days

114
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,423
Because planes had to stop so often to refuel

115
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,775
Airships could also carry 3240 X the cargo of airplane

116
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,591
Airships just made so much sense

117
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
For an Empire whose reach

118
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
Exceeded its grasp

119
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,503
So Great Britain build r101 and r100

120
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Which was

121
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,831
Its sister ship that was supposed to go to Canada and back

122
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,647
As the first two rigid ships in a fleet

123
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
That would give the crown dominance

124
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
Over the skies

125
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,535
To match its centuries-long dominance

126
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
Of the Seas

127
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,703
Intercept is conceptually quite simple but it's still an engineering Marvel

128
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,031
It's a gargantuan cigar-shaped math equation

129
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,871
On one side of the equation and wait on the other

130
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
Minimizing the weight of the airship

131
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
Was always a challenge

132
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,295
There's a rigid metal framework and that is one of the most difficult Parts because

133
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
That have to be lightweight yet strong yet r101 was supposed to match the sturdy luxury of a high-end OSHA

134
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,255
Matthew's pictures white China

135
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,095
And with royal blue and silver salt shakers and crystal glasses

136
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:33,215
Small butter dishes but to allow for those essential refinements

137
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,055
Everything else could only have the thinnest veneer of opulence

138
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,383
Because they needed everything to weigh as little as possible

139
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,455
One person described it when they touch the ceiling is like a piece of

140
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
Stage scenery

141
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
All the walls were actually fabric

142
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,111
The pillars in the lounge word made from Balsa

143
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
Covered with metal

144
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
The tables were also Balsa

145
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,487
Mermaid of the lightest cane

146
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,839
What kind of an illusion the the solidity of a ship because

147
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
You just couldn't have

148
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
Ford the list

149
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
Tons and tons

150
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,495
On the other side of the equation is left

151
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,823
You get Lyft from pumping in gas that's lighter than air

152
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
In the case of r101 the gas they use

153
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
What's hydrogen

154
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,479
Will flammable hydrogen seems like a very poor choice

155
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,527
It was for a commercial airship

156
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
The only choice

157
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,623
Use hydrogen instead of helium which is non flammable

158
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,951
Because the purpose of a ship like r101 what's a transport

159
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Cargo

160
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,047
And helium is both heavier and provides less lift

161
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
When hydrogen

162
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
What you're interested in is

163
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
The payload that you can

164
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Lips so

165
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
If you

166
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
Track all of the

167
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,775
Wait till you have to lift a rigid ship

168
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
Gasbags

169
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Water

170
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
The personnel

171
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,943
I'm in a ship like r101 if you filled it with helium

172
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
You would not have enough

173
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
Lyft Lyft

174
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,855
Flammability of hydrogen was indeed a concern intercept

175
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:59,231
But find engineers and crew were habituated to it's dangerous much like we're habituated to the danger zone

176
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,767
Combustion engines today

177
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
They felt that you just take

178
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
The proper precautions

179
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,935
What engineer production don't light a match and look in your gas tank in your car

180
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,031
When you're driving around with something highly flammable all of the time right now

181
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
Proper

182
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
Engineering Solutions in control

183
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,175
You're the reason why helium wasn't an option on Commercial airships

184
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
Was the cost

185
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
Helium at that time was produced in the USA

186
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
It comes from natural gas that

187
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Required

188
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,159
Expensive distillation plants in most of the helium is in

189
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
Places like Kansas City

190
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
Oklahoma and Texas

191
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:36,607
So they would have to pay for it to be imported into Britain and said you can make hydrogen on-site

192
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
Very cheaply

193
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
Almost 1/100 of the cost of helium

194
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,727
I was never really

195
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
You know an option never really

196
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
Considered the gas bags that contain the hydrogen

197
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Are their own engineering Mar

198
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
It's interesting to me as an engineer.

199
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Think about

200
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
The materials they had to make these

201
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Gasbag

202
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,807
Because you have a problem in that hydrogen

203
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,135
Wants to permeate the small molecule that likes to go through things

204
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
So you need something that's very strong

205
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Videos

206
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
Impermeable to

207
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Hydrogen

208
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
Or largely impermeable

209
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Adidas lightweight

210
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,399
And so they tried things like rubber gelatin glycerin

211
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
Viscose

212
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Synthetic

213
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Fabric is coated with latex

214
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,359
But they all failed one way or another like to viscose if you crumpled it up

215
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
You could not

216
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
They use in this

217
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
Stuns me to this day the intestines

218
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Dachshund

219
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:33,695
It is specifically the oxygen test with a very fine membrane is called the cecum and it's

220
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Straighten flexible

221
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,047
And hydrogen seats only slowly through it

222
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,631
Ox intestines are nearly the perfect material except

223
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
Or the size

224
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
The cecum of an ox is about

225
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,031
30 in by 6 in a square foot

226
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,359
And yet one of those gas bags if you laid it out your

227
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,943
30000 square feet to create one of these gas

228
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
You would use 50000 of his entrails Orso

229
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,623
Factors of over a million and a half oxygen test things are needed

230
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
To create the 15 gasbags

231
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,255
Sure I would have won if they delivered from

232
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
Slaughterhouses

233
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,095
Argentina leave some of the the animals

234
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,911
Barrels of these guts and then they would scrape them

235
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:20,031
And go through this long process to prepare them and eventually to glue them together

236
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:25,663
And answer your question 50,000 Ox intestines even One Secured and treated to make them into gas bags

237
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
You kind of steak

238
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:33,599
They did they did apparently if you were up in the Airship you would smell you know what kind of an animal smell

239
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,183
A musty smell also because the clock cover didn't allow light in

240
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,631
Or 101 in a few test flights in and around its hanger outside London

241
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
Great Fanfare in fact

242
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
Bill Hammack surmises that the

243
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
Focus on PR and Fanfare rather than

244
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
More rigorous and deliberative test

245
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,895
Lead to the tragedy that was about to come on the ships first

246
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,711
Attempted flight to India in 1930

247
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Good left

248
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
October 4th Mets

249
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,063
6:30 at night

250
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
Most of them work the well as reports

251
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
Somewhere observers and somewhere Diggity

252
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,975
Capital Crossing linode traveled across

253
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
Channel into France and

254
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,559
It was easy bruising wind

255
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
When sulfuric acid

256
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,911
The ground speed is only 30 miles per hour or so

257
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,567
I need a few minutes past to it was about 40 miles are 64 kilometers

258
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
North of Paris

259
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,431
Any kind of chop to the Tribune are flying about 1,200 feet but

260
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
Moving up and down a couple of hundred feet

261
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
And the top cover ripped open

262
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
The top cover was weak it was one of the weakest parts of a ship

263
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
Then at that point

264
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,791
The gas bags which are made of these very thin intestines were exposed to rain

265
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
The rain

266
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
How did the gas bag

267
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,631
There was a decrease in

268
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
Maybe drop to 500 feet or so

269
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,799
And the control car and no one knows why today signal for the engine power to be cut off

270
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
Corset locked Holden hammock

271
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
Looked at that point

272
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:04,991
And it drove nose-first the ground it slid into a Grove of Hazel and oak tree

273
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
Burst into Flame

274
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,599
There's some debate as to why it burst into flames

275
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,903
Bill Hammack thinks the fire might have been caught

276
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,695
Buy calcium phosphide flare

277
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
That book kept in the control car

278
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
Those ignite when water hits

279
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
And of course that ignited

280
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Hydrogen

281
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,727
At that point just everything became chart only six people

282
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
Survived it

283
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,799
The ground was littered

284
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
With

285
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,895
The universe sad everyday things I mean soup

286
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
Spurline Bouchard shaving brush

287
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Kind of cigarettes

288
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Peking Wok

289
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Pens

290
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
Plums with a

291
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Juice leaking

292
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
End

293
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
Then

294
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
He was very quiet

295
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
And all you could hear

296
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
What's the hits of the rain

297
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
Hotmail

298
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,167
The wreckage had barely cool

299
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,495
The British government halted their Airship program for good

300
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
It was almost immediate

301
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
R100 had flown

302
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,591
Go to Montreal and back

303
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
And it was in the shed

304
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
It never flew again

305
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
Play eventually steamrolled

306
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
R100

307
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,015
Sold some of the parts

308
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Prescribed sold Summit

309
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:17,183
Even though our 101 was completely destroyed in the French Countryside

310
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,767
The burned remains did float in the sky once again

311
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
At least for a little while

312
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
Well the wreckage of that ship

313
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Was cut up into pieces

314
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,959
Shipped back in December to Grapevine

315
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
And went to

316
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
Somebody who will

317
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Take scrap metal

318
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
And then

319
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Apparently

320
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
According to a newspaper account

321
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
It was sold

322
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
To the Zeppelin company

323
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
And they use

324
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Is part of that metal

325
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,903
Because of the Romanticism wrapped up in airships

326
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,975
The flexibility when it comes to moving huge cargo

327
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,535
Unified that requires very little

328
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
To support their operation

329
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,143
Hope that airships will make a return

330
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
Has never gone away

331
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,519
When I get a question it's going to come back and with new material

332
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,823
From the reason why they don't come back is this

333
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
Fiery disaster fill Legacy which I am

334
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
Perpetuating right now

335
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
What politician won

336
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:16,063
To vote in an Airship intend inhabit crash in somebody's about ghetto didn't you know about

337
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
The Hindenburg

338
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,743
I would not this isn't quite fair if you look at me like the Graf Zeppelin which was

339
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
The contemporary

340
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
R101 it

341
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
Predecessor to the Hindenburg

342
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
It was in service for 9 years

343
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167

Ever

349
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
To exceed 1 million flight miles

Navigated

The globe

353
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
In just 21 days so there is

354
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
You know another history back

355
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647
Necessities things can be made and can be made

356
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
Well

357
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,511
At this point the airplane has had a Century's worth of development in

358
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Efficiencies

359
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Speed and safety

360
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
So that the need for the airship

361
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
Has been largely eliminated

362
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
The past is precedent

363
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,775
Some enterprising engineer is in a room full of venture capitalist right now

364
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Trying to convince

365
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567

That work in a world that's a lie gars

373
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
But somehow

374
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
More wondrous

375
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:47,711
What are the most memorable pieces of audio of all time and my favorite video by the engine

376
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Junior guy

377
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,647
Between the beats

378
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,719
Bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

379
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,279
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

380
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
If

381

Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

387
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
To make them more human

388
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Turn the living room lights on

389
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975

Okay

393
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:41,983
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

394
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
Makes for a much more natural experience

395
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
Turn the living room lights on

396
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
Dim the living room lights to 50

We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

399
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,439
Landscape is impacting our health

400
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,999
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

401
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,815

When the Hindenburg crashed and burned in a New Jersey field in 1937

414
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:54,175
A reporter from Chicago radio station WLS named Herbert Morrison was there is real-time Rihanna

415
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,991
Disaster that was unfolding in front of him

416
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,831
Became one of the most memorable recordings in broadcast history

417
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:05,439
Couple people on staff here at never heard it before it's totally shocked me

418
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,487
So I wanted to play here

419
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,303
You might not be able to make out all the words but

420
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
Morrison's emotions

421
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
Through loud and clear

422
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
Comparable

423
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,327
That radio recording was later paired with newsreel footage of the disaster

424
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,911
36 of the 97 people on board the Hindenburg

425
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Died

426
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
When you see the footage

427
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
Airship

428
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,311
The fact that 61 people survived

429
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Seems like

430
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
America

431
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:09,087
As I mentioned in my introduction to Bill hammock on YouTube he's known as engineer guy

432
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,743
And I would be remiss if I didn't point you toward his fantastic video on the ingenious design of the aluminum beverage

433
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
Which is for my money

434
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:21,119
The greatest video on YouTube it is 11 and 1/2 minutes

435
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
Everyday design and Engineering Glory

436
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
I love it

437
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
Here's a little audio sample

438
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,799
Why is there a tab on the end of the can

439
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,359
It seems a silly question how else would you open it

440
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
But originally cans didn't have time

441
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,223
Very early steel cans were cold

442
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
Pretty obvious reason

443
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,599
You use a special opener to puncture a hole drink

444
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
And hold of it

445
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

482
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:33,728
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

483
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,056
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

484
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
A dad

485
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,432
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

486
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,736
Actually if I'm being honest

487
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,784
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that

488
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Nothing

489
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:54,208
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called immortal

490
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,792
Was found dead in my private gym

491

494
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
Now

495
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
