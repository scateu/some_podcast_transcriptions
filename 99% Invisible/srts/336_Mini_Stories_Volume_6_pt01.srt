You sure like if your

49
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,912
You are a restaurant worker or a dishwasher you take out the trash in the in the back alley you're like having a

50
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,752
Secret rendezvous in the back alley totally like that's an alley is

51
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
Where things

52
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,592
Exactly

53
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
The point

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,432
Is that regardless of what's Happening

55
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
In film

56
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,528
All of these Ali scenes help

57
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
Esl audiences

58
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Is on the same eye

59
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
But New York is a city of

60
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Thousand

61
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
Each with its own

62
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,560
This one time from

63
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Which is better

64
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
There are no

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,496
They can't be true it's hard to wrap your mind around because we've all been

66
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
Raised on this myth that New York has

67
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
And there are some in the Attleboro

68
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
But like if you spent time in

69
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,736
And you really search your memory you will not remember

70
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
At least not like a classic Ali

71
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
Between two Street

72
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,672
At the fire usually maybe at Beth like it was like a glorified

73
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:46,816
Right right I can't specifically remember when you're right but that seems amazing to me

74
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,704
Do I think there is

75
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
And then why aren't there

76
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
Is there a question

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
Right right what's up what's the first why aren't

78
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
And this is because

79
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,712
When the city planners laid out the grid for Manhattan North

80
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Houston Street in

81
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
1811 and something called

82
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
Commissioners plan

83
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,856
They purposely did not include out

84
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,440
They figured that they didn't meet Ali's cuz I got the high frequency

85
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
East west

86
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
You're much closer to

87
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,047
Gather to each other in the north-south streets

88
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,095
Kind of obviated the need for

89
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
Shortcuts

90
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
Or anything else that might break up

91
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
They're wonderful

92
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:30,079
But also and this is probably the real motivation it was a way to maximize

93
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,919
Because this way without any Ally cutting through the blocks

94
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
Badlanders can squeezing more housing

95
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
In Orlando

96
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,087
And after that almost no alleys were built because

97
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,647
Why on an ally when you can own a large

98
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,231
And so the result is that today Manhattan

99
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,535
Best a dozen things you might call Ali

100
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Weather all

101
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
South Canal

102
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
Oldest part of the

103
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
That's amazing

104
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
We know that you mention it

105
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,799
The thing I noticed the most when I'm walking in the streets of New York

106
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
Is the piles and piles of trash

107
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Which

108
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
When I live in Chicago

109
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
That's putting me out

110
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
That is not on there

111
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
Streak

112
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
Chicago is like

113
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
The antithesis

114
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Chicago

115
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,599
Mm

116
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
And it said it's so cute to the egg

117
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
But you know

118
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,583
It's weird people don't put this together including

119
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
New York

120
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
One of my favorite things to do is

121
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Just like I always asked

122
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
People

123
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
When was the last time you remember

124
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
Thanks I'm going to get somewhere

125
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
The quickest way to get there would be

126
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
Did you take the alley shortcut

127
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
It's not it's not a thing

128
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,855
It's only when you pointed out to them that they kind of step back and go

129
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,951
So this is Nick car and he's a film locations

130
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Route to work

131
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
In New York for many years

132
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
What's the world

The Smurfs movies

136
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,591
Ve got another New York

137
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,175
When your television shows turned into a movie

138
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,319
And he says disbelief that New York has alleys

139
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
Is like the bane of his

140
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671

Newyorknewyork Ygnacio Valley

142
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
But you were to tell a director

143
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
That there are no alleys in

144
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,447
They look at you like you have two heads and think that you don't know how to do your job

145
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,055
So invariably eat reluctantly wines up

146
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
Showing them

HD film izle Ali's

149
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,527
In New York that look like how you want to look I taste like five or six

150
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
None of those five or six

151
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,367
Most of them are they privately owned

152
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
Expensive

153
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
Weather permitting issues

154

Logistical dispensaries parking constraints

155
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,583
Leaving only the one Ally just south of Canal Street and

156
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Easter Broadway

157
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
And that is Cortlandt alley

158
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,287
Which is just it is the alley

159
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
And Courtland

160
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
You have to understand

161
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
It's the alley you've been seen

162
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
Yuri

Higher life

164
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,295
You just don't realize it so like let me see it let me show you some

165
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
It's got the fire escapes it's

166
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
Loading dock

167
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
I've got no brakes and

168
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
Graffiti and it's an alley

169
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
Really is it is like it's

170
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
The perfect Deli

171
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
This is

172
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Yeah

173
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
Yeah I totally scene

174
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,103
Yes I've seen 300

175
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
And yet it's

176
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
So I can pick up such a degree that if you walked

177
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Buy it

178
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
You weren't actually notice it

179
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
Because it would feel

180
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
So intensely

181
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,927
It was like you've been there you know like even if you'd never sets wooden

182
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,999
Take it for granted because you you have already been there

183
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,559
So I'm pretty sure that whatever the first time I said

184
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,863
I walk down that alley it might as well have been like

185
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
The hundredth time I walk down that alley

186
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,983
But you're looking to get especially weird because

187
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:16,639
The reason Cortland looks like the platonic ideal of a New York Ali is precisely because it's been used in Soma

188
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,831
Classic New York Alley scene

189
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
Steve Cortland this is perfect and has been into contributing to the

190
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Fantasy of New York

191
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
Because when a director has location of mine

192
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
He has created the perfect location

193
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,727
And no location you ever find will ever match up to what it is right

194
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
Portland is what you picture

195
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,127
Did you like the pictures in his head and it's not 80% of the way there's not 900%

196
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Of what he had

197
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,967
My status because people directors CA version

198
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
New York in the other movies

199
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
TV shows and then go and

200
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
What are we created when they do their own filming

201
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,647
Sad truth is that

202
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,463
Stereotype tickets perpetuated

203
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Kid from

204
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Movie two movies

205
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
Suny cortland

206
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
Forever caught in this Loop

207
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
To the point where I can see my cat

208
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,167
All it's used for is filming by

209
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Basically

210
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Everyone always

211
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
When I used to drive by mean I swear to God it was on

212
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
New Law and Order series

213
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
No pribadi

214
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
The alley every other weekend but the thing is

215
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,711
They all did it they all do it and still do it

216
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Every

217
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
Every major crime show cop show superhero show anything that is filmed in New York headstone in Cortland like I would

218
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
I would say that with

219
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
100% confidence

220
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
Like even the one Ally

221
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
In Manhattan

222
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:42,911
Doesn't really function as an ally it's basically a film set

223
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
Hollywood

224
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
The degree to which it's like

225
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,031
Treated as a film set in Hollywood zeal

226
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,335
Pursuit of the platonic New York

227
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Ali

228
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,663
Like a story often calls for an ally to be like

229
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Double trash

230
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
Concept

231
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:04,927
Of course real trash and grime would be hazardous to the cast and crew of the first thing they do is actually clean

232
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
Would like pressure hoses

233
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
Disappoint

234
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
And then

235
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Yuan

236
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Buy movie trash

237
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
IMovie trash

238
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
Large plastic bags like trash bags

239
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
That are filled with

240
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Approved

241
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Logo

242
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,567
Sort of trash so it's like generic milk bottles

243
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
And cereal boxes

244
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,663
Each bag of movie trash is about 40 to 6

245
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
$60 a bag

246
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
So there's an industry just

247
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
Mally's look like look like Ali

248
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
What kind of interest me about all this

249
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Is it I think with

250
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Some cities

251
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
We don't really know much about

252
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
So they can

253
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
There might be like

254
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,375
Shades about San Francisco Chicago but no one outside of

255
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
Francisco like truly things

256
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
But New York

257
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Perhaps more than

258
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
Any other City

259
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
In some sense it belongs

260
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Everyone feels

261
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
The thing

262
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,199
Right because they seen it in a million movies

263
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
It is like

264
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
American city

265
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
How many people

266
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
Is the city

267
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,159
Level granularity

268
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Uptown

269
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
Downtown

270
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,559
Like like there are more like

271
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
Household name

272
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Totally

273
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
Now that makes sense

274
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,495
It's also kind of like you know but they don't

275
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,079
And the result is that at some point the idea of New York

276
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,687
As overtaken the reality of New York kind of takes cultural precedent

277
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
Human Mind of a lot of York

278
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Crazy never rely

279
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,367
It's just sad because it's almost like an actor that's Typecast

280
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
Right looks like an actor that's being asked

281
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:46,303
Play the same old roll cuz he did that one roll really really well back in 1977 so keep doing it for another

282
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
50 years

283
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,887
Sync movies

284
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
Are just so much more interesting

285
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
When you print portray

286
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,823
The locations featured for what they are and let them be a real character

287
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
Instead of just a backdrop

288
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
2 at any point

289
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
And it's

290
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
Film history

291
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
Was it ever

292
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,063
Names are presented as Cortlandt alley

293
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
Almost

294
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
Never

295
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,951
Men in Black

296
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,511
3 hottest scenes

297
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,351
Where Will Smith is tracking down an alien and they actually do

298
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
At least attempt

299
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Qid

300
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,519
Taco

301
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
Another south of Canal Street

302
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
So close so close

303
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Well I tried

304
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,503
They did their best

305
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,087
Men in Black 3

306
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Well thanks so much Joe

307
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
Thank you

308
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
Okay Sean

309
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
Composer Sean murray

310
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
What's the story of

311
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,359
Wolf first I want to ask you a question Roman so you've never done karaoke

312
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,943
I've never done karaoke how is that possible

313
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
I played

314
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,903
The singing parts of Guitar Hero that's almost karaoke

315
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Cinnabar with

316
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Strangers

317
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
I've never done that

318
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,047
Yeah doesn't count

319
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,423
So I want to tell you about the person who invented the karaoke machine

320
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
His name is Daisuke anyway

321
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
And

322
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,055
As you can imagine he loves music

323
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,871
I read this interview with him and I found out that

324
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,199
He started working as a drummer when he was still a teenager in high

325
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,319
School and after he graduated he was perpetually in a Travelin Band that did Cabaret music

326
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
9 years

327
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,927
And I think that's a really big achievement but

328
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,719
Hey in his interview he likes to

329
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
Zoe says

330
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
One night I realized that

331
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
No matter how much I practice

332
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,447
I could never be as good as someone with god-given Talent

333
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,591
And I was enough to change my life as a band man and after nine years on the road

334
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,175
Many tails and no regrets I want home it seems like

335
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
It was more than just his musicianship that

336
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
Took him out of Road life like it seems like

337
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,599
It wasn't really compensated fairly all the time and

338
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
People he was working with like there

339
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,255
Really they partied a lot and they drinking all their money away

340
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
ISO

341
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
He was 28

342
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,351
And living with his parents in Kobe Japan

343
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
After all that

344
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,679
1968

345
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:37,567
Karaoke is kind of already like a social activity but it's done with live instruments so

346
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
They're like bars where

347
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:44,223
You have like a musician playing a single guitar or keyboard or something and people singing along

348
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,111
And this was one of those kids regular gigs when he was living there with

349
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Parents

350
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
And he says

351
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
Playing the drums

352
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,743
Oh no he learned how to play keyboard

353
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
Yeah he says that he taught himself 300 songs

354
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
Switch

355
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Once again it's just like

356
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143
Humblebrag

357
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,495
Because then he says because then he goes on to say that

358
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,823
Cute like but everytime I try to learn more than 300 songs

359
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,919
I like I just would forget them all the time mixing them up

360
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,575
Wow so yeah that case is pretty down on himself okay

361
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,159
So he's working at these karaoke bars

362
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
And

363
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,255
He's got like a bunch of regular karaoke singers and

364
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,071
There was this one businessman who would always sing with him

365
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,727
The kind of changed everything this businessman was about to travel for work and he wanted to be able to sing for his colleagues on the trip

366
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,287
And I say recalled the business man saying to him

367
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,359
Your keyboard playing is the only music I can sing to

368
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
You know how my voice is and you know what it needs

369
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,991
The town good anti skate couldn't take time off work so he

370
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
Tape them self

371
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
Playing some of this guy's favorite songs

372
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
And it worked

373
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
The guy was happy

374
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Paid

375
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
And I'm sure you can see where the

376
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,071
After his success with this businessman

377
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,119
Daisuke in 1971

378
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:11,519
Commissioned a friend to build a machine out of three existing machine and amplifier a coin box and an 8-track car

379
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
Car stereo

380
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
And he called it that you Kate

381
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,407
So a hundred Yen put in a hundred yen

382
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,711
Atwood machine with turn on for 5 minutes

383
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,063
So you could put on a tape of instrumental music and singing through a microphone

384
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
And, I want you to see one of these

385
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,159
Insider very beautiful images

386
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Going to Slack

387
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
It really is beautiful

388
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,071
Yeah it's a cabinet it's red and white

389
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
It has

390
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
Gradle analog knobs

391
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
And

392
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
Place for the

393
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,543
You know the 8-track cassette what I would call the cart machine in the in the radio business that you

394
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
Press in there

395
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
And then a little

396
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,919
Back red cabinet on the right that stores

397
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
Little library of a tractor

398
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Best buffets

399
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:58,879
Is that him smiling right next to it looking man

400
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,207
In every picture you smiling like that

401
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,279
So the music on these first 8-track tapes were they the ones that

402
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,607
Did did he compose those or how did he how did he get the music

403
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
So they were

404
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,447
They were popular songs and the

405
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
Thanksgiving recorded them with his band

406
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
Actually I guess

407
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
He recorded his

408
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:22,687
Band playing the songs he says that early on in the process they fired him from playing

409
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:30,111
Again poured a skateboard

410
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,671
So he just focused on recording and mixing the music

411
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,791
Which is really important part totally totally

412
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
No karaoke machine

413
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,399
Recording and mixing thank you Sharif

414
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:50,335
And it's funny to me because even though it was fired from his own van he was

415
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
A real Hustler

416
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,455
He got bars all over, to lease these machines from him

417
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,527
He got contracts with major record labels to use all these Poppy

418
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
Your songs

419
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,439
He didn't patent the machine no

420
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
He says

421
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,743
When I first made the Jew Gates

422
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,303
A brother-in-law suggested I take out a patent

423
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
But at the time

424
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,703
I didn't think anything would come of it I was just hoping the drinking places in the Cobra area

425
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,239
Use my machine

426
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,287
Most people don't believe me when I say this

427
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,359
I don't think karaoke would have taken off like

428
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,919
If there had been a patent on the first machine

429
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,479
I think that's actually a pretty fair

430
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
Assessment

431
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,343
You know it's a really nice and joyful thing even though I've never

432
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,231
This machine is really really lovely in it

433
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
Is it nice to think of it

434
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,839
Is it just existing in the world to make the world better and not necessarily to make

435
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
But money

436
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
It does make some people money

437
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
This other person

438
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,799
Did take out a patent on a LaserDisc karaoke machine

439
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
But he's not part of the

440
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Right now

441
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
I know that's right amount of History yeah

442
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
Ozon

443
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:07,135
Besides I didn't build the thing from scratch the amp the microphone the 8-track player even the hundred Yen box machine all had

444
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,559
You think so yeah I don't know anything about that

445
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,119
About Patton especially Japanese patent law

446
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:21,471
Well I don't know about dabbing patamon actually I'm no expert of US patent law but

447
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
If you come up with

448
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
A new use

449
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
Or even own thing

450
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,639
And prescribed that you since I have the patent

451
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,967
It doesn't have to be three machines that could be one machine to do a search

452
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,015
A little something and change it

453
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
He totally had the right to it

454
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,743
So this is just more of him talking smack on himself I really love about this story on a whole is that he seems

455
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,791
Pretty okay with how all of this turned out

456
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
He talks a lot about

457
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Just like

458
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
How glad he is

459
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,471
Is that this brought so much joy into the world and he says

460
00:19:53,983 --> 00:20:00,127
I may not have the original patent some say I would have made 80 million dollars last year and that was a bad year

461
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,711
But I have good friends and a family I love

462
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
And I can't help but smile everyday

463
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,807
There were things some uppers

464
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
Yeah I guess the last thing

465
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
I just wanted to

466
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Say that

467
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
Daisuke says

468
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,207
To honor karaoke

469
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,023
And his wife and daughter and three granddaughters

470
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,071
Get out of song book once a week

471
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
And

472
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
See who can sing the most

473
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:27,007
Songs before going horse with

474
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Sounds

475
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:34,431
So crazy that's a way harder than I want to party

476
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,247
And yeah and there's more to his story

477
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:41,343
But I think it's better told from him so we'll put a link to that on our website

478
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Nice

479
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Alright then

480
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,975
And we should totally go karaoking sometime I think we could make that

481
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Text

482
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:02,079
About a year ago our senior editor Delaney Hall move from beautiful Downtown Oakland California back to New Mexico or she

483
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:08,479
She grew up she now works for 99p I remotely and her mini story is about this phenomenon in the new city where she live

484
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
Santa Fe

485
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,063
The phenomenon is called

486
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Zozobra

487
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,672
Does Oprah is a big deal here in Santa Fe

488
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,696
Basically

489
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Every year

490
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
A group of people in the city build

491
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,816
This enormous marionette

492
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
That's named

493
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
Sosobra

494
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,704
And in Spanish is over that means anxiety

495
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
So he's like

496
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,312
All of the city's Collective sorrows

497
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
Embodied in this

498
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,712
Wow

499
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,016
That's amazing so what is he what does he look like

500
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
50 ft tall

501
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,392
She is dressed in a long white

502
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,000
He has he's very dark Angry Eyes they're usually

503
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
Rimmed

504
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
Green or black

505
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,888
And what happens is that

506
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
Every fall.

507
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,496
This group constructs a new Zozobra and about 50

508
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
50000 people

509
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
Gathering one of Santa Fe

510
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Is biggest parks

511
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,504
Wow they burn them yeah yeah they it's a very

512
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,296
It's a very intense

513
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,648
Kind of pig feeling events

514
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
I mean basically the crowd chant

515
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,072
Burnham Burnham Burnham and he's he's set on fire and he is

516
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,864
Slowly engulfed in flame

517
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:35,264
And I assume they burn him so they can burn their Collective anxiety that he represents

518
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
Yeah yeah exactly

519
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
Please soak

520
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Because

521
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
Because he represents bloom

522
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
It's this way that the

523
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
The city

524
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Purges

525
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
Sadness

526
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
And

527
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,576
People get to participate in these interesting ways

528
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
And one of the reasons

529
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
Sosobrat is

530
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
The flammable is that he is

531
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Stuffed with

532
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
Bushels of shredded

533
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
And where that

534
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,840
Paper comes from is in the week

535
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
Leading up to the burning

536
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
Anyone within

537
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
Excessive Gloom

538
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,984
Is

539
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
Encouraged

540
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Rate down there

541
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Gloomy thoughts

542
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
Sunapee

543
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
Paper

544
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
And to leave it in this thing called the

545
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
Gloom box

546
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,456
Which at least in the past has been located

547
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
In the office

548
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
This Is Us

549
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
One of the local news

550
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
Papers that people contribute

551
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
Police reports

552
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,904
Mortgage documents

553
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,792
It reminds me of other Thrift

554
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
Bonfire rituals like

555
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,912
Like burning man or something with a lot of people go to around here

556
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,472
Yeah I mean it's a soda has been around a lot

557
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
Longer than Burning Man

558
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
Turn around since the 90

559
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,616
There are definitely some similarities like

560
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
Those were developed by

561
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,224
Artists both events began relatively

562
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,528
Small like in someone's backyard around him

563
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,344
And then grew into something much

564
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,184
Bigger and I'm both actually drawn other Traditions they go back

565
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Even farther

566
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,256
But one thing that's

567
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,304
Pretty neat about Cisco bat is that

568
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,352
Because he's a puppet

569
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
Capable of

570
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,704
Kind of rudimentary movement so

571
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,800
Arm swing around his jaw is hinged

572
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,616
So his mouth opens and closes

573
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,408
And he also makes

574
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Sound

575
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
So I'm going to play

576
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:26,368
A little bit of sound of the event so you can hear it

577
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,584
Flailing at the same time

578
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
Yashow

579
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,960
Wailing his mouth is opening and closing

580
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,800
It's really it's actually really troubling event

581
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
To go to as a

582
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,408
Kid it is sort of seared into my memory

583
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,736
This is actually like the thing I most want to tell you about the

584
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,760
Because I

585
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,832
I recently learned just in the past year or so

586
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,928
That the voice of Zozobra is performed live

587
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:06,560
And there is one guy who's been doing the voice for about 20 years

588
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,144
And I learned this thanks to

589
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
This Gem of local reporting from

590
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
Koe tea

591
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
Action 7 News

592
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
Me

593
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
I see him as an old grumpy old man

594
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,200
The character that I get into

595
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
This

596
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
This is so bright you know

597
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
That want to get rid of him that wanted

598
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
Destroying the water burn

599
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
And

600
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
My

601
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,720
The way I play the character is I'm fighting

602
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,280
They live

603
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,584
Friday Michael Ellis

604
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
Take on the Persona of archillect

605
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,912
SRO for the 19th

606
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,984
Despite the title of old man Gloom

607
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,544
Just hope his voice battles several emotions

608
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
Sparrow times

609
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,152
Until sound like he's crying

610
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,992
Adamant

611
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,296
I'm not going to let you do this to me again

612
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:05,696
50000 should always know what is over

613
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,488
Is feeling not only do I want

614
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
The crowd to hear it

615
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
I want him to

616
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,864
And even after 19 years for Alice

617
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,912
The big night is always exciting

618
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
I'll sit down and have a sandwich

619
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,472
Dictionary after

620
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
After that

621
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,544
I've got butterflies

622
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
I won't have it

623
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
Until after it's all over

624
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
On Friday night

625
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
Those butterflies join all of him

626
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
Gloom

627
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
Vinsmoke

628
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
Yeah I just

629
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
I love this news clip so much I think it's one of my my favorites ever and

630
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:42,048
Is the combination of the reporters seriousness or maybe Mox

631
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,608
Serious Mass and then just like

632
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:50,496
The sublime Ridiculousness of what you're seeing which of course people can't see it but

633
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
To describe it

634
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
It's Michael Ellis

635
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
The voice of Sombra

636
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,176
Performing the sounds of Zelda butt

637
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
To this big

638
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
Empty baseball

639
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
Field

640
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,856
Which you know probably later in the night will be filled with 50

641
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
3006

642
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
50000 screaming people but

643
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,720
But at the moment is just entirely

644
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
So good

645
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:19,680
So you get like a little taste of what my glass is about but what is he really like

646
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
Yasso

647
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,544
This was the only thing I could find on the internet

648
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
About him

649
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,152
And from seeing this clip I definitely wanted to learn

650
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,480
And so I looked him up and went to

651
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
To talk with him

652
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
And what

653
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,344
What I learned is that he was

654
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
Born and raised in San

655
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,440
And Michael told me that

656
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
You know Isaac

657
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Kid

658
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
So silver was like this

659
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,048
Figure this monster

660
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,120
Almost seemed real life

661
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
5 +

662
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,240
That sense of realness was this thing

663
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,032
That the community

664
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,080
Continues to really play into

665
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
Cultivate

666
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
Throwing up bile

667
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
I remember

668
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
Belittle stories

669
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,296
Newspaper talking about how sober has been spotted

670
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,856
In the Royals in the east side of town

671
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,160
You would hear stories of

672
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
She

673
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Being missing

674
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
The area

675
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Things like that

676
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
Play into

677
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Trying to make

678
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
Seem real

679
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,192
And so from there how did Michael actually become the boys

680
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
Does Oprah

681
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,752
So as a high-schooler

682
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
He started volunteering for

683
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
She would help with

684
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
Building the puppet

685
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
Like that and he just kept being involved

686
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
A little more each year

687
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,504
Eventually

688
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
He was asked

689
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
Asked if you wanted to help with the voice

690
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,928
I was just sort of a matter of hanging around for long enough

691
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:50,816
And so did Michael do it any differently that he had something special to the voice when he took over

692
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,400
Michael didn't have any formal voice acting experience he's

693
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,960
He's done various jobs throughout his life

694
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,776
Including working at Lowe's hardware

695
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,824
Running a DJ business

696
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:06,944
But he told me that the main thing he wanted to bring to soba was that sense of real

697
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
That kind of alive

698
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
But I was

699
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
Talking about Earl

700
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
And

701
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
To do that

702
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,392
He said he had to find ways to really emphasize

703
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,744
Which celebrity has grumpy old man and to see the whole event

704
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
Unfolding from

705
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
His perspective

706
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
Knowing that

707
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,400
Everybody wants his demise

708
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,704
They want to see it happen

709
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
So I

710
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
I do my best

711
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
To try to

712
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
To fight

713
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
With

714
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
You know with my voice

715
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
There are times when

716
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
Almost sound like

717
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,040
Scrying

718
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,232
He's going to be able to do to stop it

719
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:55,840
Of course in our conversation and I was like pushing to try to understand is there some

720
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,680
Salumi memory or

721
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,448
Experience

722
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,008
Did Michael Taps into in order to

723
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Perform

724
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
I asked him about his personal

725
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,104
History

726
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,944
I asked him about some health problems he's had recently

727
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
But he said

728
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
Not really

729
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,600
When it's needed

730
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
You just got the red Aaliyah

731
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,232
Accessible grumpy old man right there

732
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
I guess

733
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,840
APS a little bit of that deep inside

734
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
So that's

735
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:37,056
That's the voice of Sabrina and I I really like thinking about the fact that when I went to see so so but I burn

736
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,336
Back in the 80s

737
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,408
It was Michael performing The Voice

738
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
Tell me if I take

739
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
If I take

740
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
Fiona Ma

741
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,040
My daughter next year that it will probably be me

742
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
Up next is our technical producer

743
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
Sharif Youssef

744
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
All right

745
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,216
It's a Roman if I told you

746
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,776
That I had another Maps

747
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
Story

748
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,104
How excited would you be

749
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,248
Okay cool if you can Master it all I know maybe

750
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
I made it here

751
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
Just go to Google Maps real quick

752
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:27,232
The main thing we're going to be looking at today is the border between the u.s. and Canada and pardon my eyes

753
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:32,096
Siblings I have some dental work

754
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,144
And I think we need to pay attention to his

755
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,984
49th parallel in the Pacific Northwest of America

756
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,544
I'm so glad that you're okay

757
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,568
Yeah and you can like

758
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,848
Probably

759
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,432
Maybe now can notice a little something that looks off

760
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
Are you talking about Point Roberts

761
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
Sticks out right here

762
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Yeah

763
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,880
Point Roberts on that little peninsula

764
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,672
Tsawwassen peninsula

765
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,000
Maybe you can just sort of describe what you're seeing

766
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
So

767
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,608
Robertson Upper Peninsula off of

768
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,912
Bay Area Vancouver

769
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,728
It looks like it's completely cut off from the US

770
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
Except by water

771
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,336
You have to buy land you have to get to it

772
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,616
To Canada

773
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,896
It's got a few

774
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,432
Very very gritted

775
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
Streets

776
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:26,880
A couple

777
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,184
It is kind of like an exclave

778
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,720
But but not

779
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:34,304
Yeah it's it's a it's a it's a semi

780
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
Exclusives

781
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,936
Space but it is difficult to get into so innocent exclusive

782
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,520
So yeah

783
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:46,336
Point Roberts is actually in Washington State

784
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,128
Heart of Whatcom County

785
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,176
I first heard about Point Roberts

786
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,712
Scrum podcast

787
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
Call Scott

788
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,272
Podcasting yourself

789
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,112
Dave shumka and Graham Clark

790
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
2 vancouverites

791
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,976
Mario there

792
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,840
Cuz it's only 20 miles away or so in order to pick up packages because

793
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,424
Shipping across the border is actually quite expensive

794
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,472
I'm and also to get cheaper gas

795
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,544
It's also rumored to be the site of

796
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,360
Federal witness protection program

797
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,640
Like where they relocate

798
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:27,040
And I just happened to be in Seattle a little bit ago and I also wanted an excuse to go to

799
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,648
Vancouver and how do you pay for it so I decided to go

800
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,928
Should I just play some

801
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
Border

802
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,024
Crossing my first board

803
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,328
This is the Peace Arch border

804
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,376
From Washington signature

805
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
Exactly

806
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,704
I'm good how are you

807
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
What's a preposition today

808
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:52,640
I'm going to Point Roberts to report a story I was just like a weird little part of America that you have to go through like to ball

809
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,920
Border crossings to get to

810
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,224
Yeah yeah

811
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,320
I'm very nervous yakety hear my voice cracked lips

812
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:05,952
I think there's a there's an instinct that arises in every Arab

813
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,256
Crossing a border

814
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:13,120
Also funny story the last time I crossed the Canadian border

815
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
I was

816
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:19,008
Three or four years old going into the American side of Niagara Falls

817
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,312
And the Border guide

818
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
LinkedIn was like

819
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,896
Is everyone in this car American

820
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:29,504
And it has like I'm Egyptian she's American and

821
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,344
He's American in the back and I don't know I'm French I'm being kidnapped

822
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,488
Oh my God there's there's some decent ROM around the Canadian border

823
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,792
I'm sorry if I was a little

824
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:46,144
Scamp camper van

825
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,704
Nice

826
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Okay

827
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Are you making any stops image

828
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,872
9 between but I'm spending the night in Vancouver tonight

829
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
Have a good time

830
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
Thanks man

831
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Unscathed

832
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
Unscathed

833
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,808
Yeah he was a very nice

834
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
Border crossing guard

835
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:10,720
Did ask if I had been arrested which apparently is a thing like if you've been arrested you

836
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,488
Can't

837
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,512
You have to get like

838
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:17,120
Special permission to get into Canada if you have a criminal record in the states

839
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:23,520
It's another 20 or 30 minute drive to border number to welcome to Little America

840
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
I just crossed the

841
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
Border entry point

842
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Scenic Loop

843
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
Gateway

844
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,944
That sounds like something I would do

845
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,968
I like seeing it

846
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:39,648
And I basically immediately to my right after I cross the border there's a place that receives

847
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,952
Packages open 24/7

848
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,280
Automated retriever

849
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,608
Vacuum Brew Coffee Parcel Services

850
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,400
It seems like there are a lot of places

851
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
And that was the theme throughout

852
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,776
The entire time in Point Roberts basically any shop

853
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
No matter what it was

854
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,336
Selling or what it did

855
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,616
They offered to accept

856
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,664
Packages for you

857
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
It's good to be back

858
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,808
To The Familiar land of America

859
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
The gases in gallons

860
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,440
Oh maybe it's not

861
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,768
Hello interesting

862
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
Facey measure the

863
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,632
Gas in liters

864
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,424
Here even in America

865
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,960
That's nuts

866
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:29,312
Wow leaders yeah leader

867
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:37,760
So what else did you find these little differences that decides the leaders revelation

868
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,088
Yeah there wasn't much it wasn't the most

869
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
Happening spot

870
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
Free wood

871
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,976
It's about like five square miles of population

872
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
Of

873
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,584
1314

874
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,888
Latest US Census in 2010

875
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,496
In the summertime it can grow to about three or four times that

876
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:02,848
Because a lot of Canadian vacationers come in I went to the post office

877
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
Closed

878
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
Cuz it's Saturday

879
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
150

880
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
Is there a

881
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,992
School City

882
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
I had saw that

883
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:14,880
There is one primary school I believe it goes up to grade

884
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,904
Three or four

885
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,744
And then everyone who is older than that has to go

886
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,328
Across for international borders every school day

887
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm to go to school in Blaine Washington

888
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:33,056
Yeah and I I grew up in a fairly brutal place with long school bus ride so I very much empathize and feel for you

889
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,360
Any point Roberts School

890
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
Kids umbrellas

891
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,944
Driving down the main drag

892
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,248
Biggest little store in Point Roberts

893
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,832
Eventually I ran into Fair

894
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,856
Restaurant

895
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
Easter egg

896
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,928
Call The Reef Tavern

897
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,488
Happy that right

898
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:58,400
Reef Tavern is calling to you that's that's what we call you I don't know if people know that

899
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,984
And I at The Reef Tavern I had a wonderful server name

900
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
20

901
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,056
And he was just the absolute

902
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
Swedish

903
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,712
Person and told me about how people from Canada go to that restaurant to get medium-rare burgers

904
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:18,368
Because apparently the health codes in Canada are a little more strict about how what's the

905
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Perms

906
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,464
Basically in Canada

907
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,256
I'm so the real

908
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:30,912
Bud connoisseurs go to Point Roberts journalist from Oakland California

909
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,896
So cool that you ran into the other Oakland guy yeah

910
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,432
What are the odds

911
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,992
And that's not even the weirdest part

912
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,040
Let me play you a little

913
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
Little something

914
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,368
Get ready to have your mind blown Roman

915
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:55,488
The point

916
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,072
Purple dust

917
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,912
Yeah you guys have the same catchphrase

918
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,752
Oh my God yeah maybe

919
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
Yeah I know I don't understand how

920
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:14,432
The stars of the universe aligned in such a way but she's supposed to go there I know

921
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,224
It sounds like a lovely trap

922
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,528
Did you ever figure out why the gas was in liters

923
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,576
I didn't do much soup

924
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:26,976
Sleuthing but my guess is mainly to Market to Canadians

925
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,256
Yeah exactly

926
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,816
And I actually at the reef

927
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:35,168
Tavern I saw two very lovely Canadians named Jason and Lisa

928
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:40,288
They had come in that very day to pick up a Guitar Loop pedal

929
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,128
I'm from a seller on eBay who didn't want to ship it across the border

930
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
Perfect

931
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:51,296
Yeah here with super, who is doing the

932
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
Totally Tan

933
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:56,928
Looking into the town Lisa saw that the average visitor spends less than 20 minutes

934
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
Only 5% of visitors

935
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,512
Scotty longer than an hour

936
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,304

937
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:08,448
Cool thank you so much I'll give you guys my life phone number

938
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:17,408
Making friends making friends and coincidentally I showed them

939
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,456
Where I was staying in

940
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:23,296
Vancouver and it was basically right next to them

941
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:27,648
And they invited me to drink wine and decorate their Christmas tree

942
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
I'm and it was

943
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,720
Just A really lovely

944
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,280
Evening that's so cool

945
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,608
Did you ever get confirmation about the witness protection thing

946
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,448
Well I guess I could neither

947
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,776
Confirm nor deny it

948
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:50,432
I actually reached out to Gerald short the founder of the witness protection program and

949
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:54,528
And he responded back and he says I have no information on Point Roberts

950
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
Washington

951
00:40:55,808 --> 00:41:00,928
I wish I guess you can take to be like anything you want

952
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
That's awesome

953
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,000
Nice Adventure

954
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:10,656
In the name of the show thanks for thanks for the expense

955
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
No problem

956
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,448
X-ray

957
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Yeah

958
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984

With one more mini Story coming up next

962
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
With the king of the coda

963

Kurt Kolstad

964
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
After that

965
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,072
You

966
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:42,656
You inspired Xfinity to create internet that puts you in charge

967
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:47,008
Draw your movie marathons are better when you can stream them all night

968
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,360
Video chats for Grandpa's birthday it should be possible from anywhere in your house

969
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,919
And when you can pause wifi before bedtime

970
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
Putting your kids to sleep

971
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
Gets a little bit easier

972
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:01,855
So Xfinity reimagined Wi-Fi in created Xfinity X5

973
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,927
Because for the best Wi-Fi experience you need speed

974
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
Coverage and control

975
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,535
This is beyond Wi-Fi this is X5

976
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,351

Bongs and Charter of our devices

980
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,567
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

981
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,591
If

982
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:27,199
I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

983
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:33,087
Talking to me and my wife is in another room and another hearing. Voice

984
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
Technology

985
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
She talked to us

986
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,927
It is a creation of Sonic trap

987
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,999
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

988
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,583
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

989
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,631
To make them more human

990
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,471
Turn the living room lights on

991
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
Okay

992
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
Dim the living room lights to 50

993
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
2%

994
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
Okay

995
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:02,271
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

996
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,319
Makes for a much more natural

997
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Experience

998
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,135
Turn the living room lights on

999
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,207
Dim the living room lights

1000
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,231
50%

1001
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,559
We're presenting to

1004
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,031

So every year the end of the year in the beginning of the next year we do these many stories

1018
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,831
And

1019
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:12,415
The funny thing is is that the many stories were so popular

1020
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:18,559
That we began doing important time in the history of a car

1021
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,375
Almost every episode

1022
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:24,447
Is it always some story that Kurt has that relates

1023
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,239
Do the story we just told

1024
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:32,639
But this one we never found a place that I really wanted to tell him

1025
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:36,735
The perfect opportunity last year the Ford Motor Company

1026
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,271
Play big news in Detroit

1027
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,319
And they said they were going to buy and renovate

1028
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,343
Michigan Central Station

1029
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:47,999
It was like a big train stations were like Grand Central Terminal type train station

1030
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,023
Central

1031
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,071
Much taller in downtown Detroit

1032
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:55,935
Yeah it's really visible when you're coming in on the highway it's in like one of the most visible

1033
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,471
Tallest structures on the side of the Sun

1034
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,287
Baste still in Detroit

1035
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,055
Bought this

1036
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:06,943
And suddenly there is all this news around the fact that they're going to come out do this big press conference

1037
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:11,039
And explain to the city what their plan was for this old building that have been

1038
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
Deserted for so long

1039
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,367
Big press conference

1040
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,903
Someone anonymously approach

1041
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,183
The Ford Museum

1042
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
With this

1043
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
Surprising artifact

1044
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:25,375
It was this big round antique clock that used to hang really prominently on one of the walls of the station

1045
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,399
Let's face it

1046
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,703
Train passengers needed to know the time

1047
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,727
Show the clock

1048
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:30,751
Puge

1049
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,567
It's been gone for very long time

1050
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,127
He couldn't believe it when a secret approach with me

1051
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,919
To get that clock back

1052
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:42,015
Somebody must have really loved it and loved the train station cuz I took very good care of it

1053
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:46,879
So somebody stole this gigantic clock from the train station and then they returned it when they heard

1054
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,415
That the transition can be renovated

1055
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:54,815
Yeah it's pretty remarkable and we don't really know much about the person who returned the clock and then maybe they just took it

1056
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,143
Get to try to help preserve it maybe they were in the original Thief

1057
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:04,799
It's possible they bought it or found it on eBay or inherited it only really know for sure is that

1058
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,079
They carefully wrapped it up

1059
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,895
And then told the folks at the Ford Museum where to find it

1060
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:13,247
Play me where to buy it like they left it somewhere and they like

1061
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:18,623
Like along side of the side of a building their pictures of this you can see it like he just kind of wrapped it up in like

1062
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:25,023
Strapped it in Fahrenheit

1063
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,815
The clock but bring a couple guys and a Truck

1064
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:33,215
Wow it's felt so inspired to give it back and then I think this is sort of a Civic icon

1065
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,799
Carlos this stunning massive Bozarth structure

1066
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:40,639
It was designed by the same Architects as Grand Central terminal in New York

1067
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,479
Mdid originally was that it would be the Grand Central of the Midwest

1068
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,783
Wood handle all this passenger and Freight traffic

1069
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
And be kind of you know

1070
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
Is landmark in the city

1071
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
Sleepy puppies

1072
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,695
It's filled with all these beautiful details.

1073
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
Marble walls

1074
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,767
Vaulted ceilings copper skylights

1075
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
And it's cute

1076
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,143
18 stories tall so there are restaurants and shops and below

1077
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,679
And then office spaces above

1078
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:09,055
And so but obviously it's on hard time swimming wrong with the Michigan Central Station

1079
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,359
Well a lot of things arguably but

1080
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:15,711
The rise of the car definitely help drive it out of business

1081
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,271
We're driving out to the suburbs in the city itself

1082
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,551
Anesthesia

1083
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,575
Found Odysseus

1084
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,367
At first the office has cleared out

1085
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,951
And then the shops and restaurants that closed down and then finally in the 80s

1086
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,487
The ticket booth shut down

1087
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,279
And basically the whole place was

1088
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,863
They just abandoned it was left empty at that point

1089
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,167
Yeah and there was talk over the years

1090
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:38,239
Tearing it down but it had this statuses

1091
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,007
Is landmark

1092
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,031
And that

1093
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,567
Protected from Demolition

1094
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
You know they came up with

1095
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,383
Attempts to try to reuse this like

1096
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:49,247
Ideas to turn into a police station or a Convention Center or even a casino

1097
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,783
And none of those panned out

1098
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
So the building just kind of

1099
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,855
Insulting changing hands

1100
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,135
And the owners

1101
00:47:55,391 --> 00:48:01,535
Before Ford finally did do some work on it like they drain the basement and they added some new windows and they put up a security fence

1102
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,887
Obviously that must have happened after the clock was stolen

1103
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:12,287
Yeah yeah they definitely were aware that things are disappearing from the building and I had to put a stop to that

1104
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,639
Explore it but

1105
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,431
Along the way hundreds of artifacts

1106
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,991
So the clock is really just one piece

1107
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:27,391
Is the bus there is lots of little things taken from the story about imagine over the years yeah a really large bees that took you to

1108
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:32,255
But definitely one of many things and returning it actually started this kind of bigger movement

1109
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,815
Because once Ford have the clock in hand

1110
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,399
They were able to put out a call and say hey it looks my return this clock

1111
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,935
If anybody else has stuff

1112
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:46,591
Maybe you can bring it back too and you won't get in trouble no-questions-asked leave it on the side of a building

1113
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,871
It works

1114
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:51,711
Doesn't the people have now come forward to offer up old station artifact

1115
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:56,319
Plaster medallions light fixtures

1116
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:02,719
Yeah in Fort actually has a wishlist to they want back things like the ticket window grills elevator transom

1117
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,255
And all other clocks

1118
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,047
Spiritual years

1119
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,839
And basically you know anything that

1120
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:14,239
That is sort of considered critical to the historic character of the building right in what are the other planning to restore it as it was

1121
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,031
Really plan to do with all these artifacts

1122
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:20,895
Well something's will probably go back into the building and others will end up in local museums

1123
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,687
Acai benefits

1124
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
What is that

1125
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,503
Silly things can be used to model copy

1126
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,319
These two rights if you have one planet

1127
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,599
A bunch of other ones

1128
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,135
Renovated building

1129
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
Well that makes sense

1130
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,743
Who is the idea that this thing is going to be like a

1131
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,511
Passenger

1132
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:42,911
Train terminal again or is it something different for tired snowhead

1133
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:47,519
Sir famous International design firm to help them build out

1134
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,799
A new campus

1135
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,335
The calling at the

1136
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,359
Corktown campus

1137
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,919
Could be the center for Ford to develop

1138
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:58,015
Autonomous vehicles and other urban road related Technologies

1139
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,111
Central area where they can do like actual on the road testing

1140
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,415
And the station itself is going to be

1141
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,207
The heart of this

1142
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,791
Repopulate actually restaurants

1143
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,559
Coin shops

1144
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:15,423
And above their going to be offices but also condos now is that for

1145
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,751
Some of the people at its partner organizations up into the

1146
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,519
B spaces

1147
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:25,151
Have you seen pictures of the artifacts and and the renovation at all

1148
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:28,223
And it's sitting outside wrapped up

1149
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:32,831
And there a lot of historic photos that cannot show what was their what's missing and

1150
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:36,927
Ford's plan for what this building is going to look like when they're all done with this campus

1151
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,743

What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

1184

I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

Actually if I'm being honest

1187
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,855
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

1188
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,135
Nothing

1189
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:49,535
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

Was found dead in my private gym

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

1192
00:52:56,447 --> 00:53:00,543
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

1193
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,567
Now

1194
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,615
