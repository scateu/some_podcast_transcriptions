1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
This is 99% invisible

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,072
I'm Roman Mars

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,888
This past fall

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,496
200 people gathered at the Explorers Club in New York City

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:15,360
The building was once a clubhouse to feigned naturalist's and explorers

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,944
Now it's an archive of ephemera and Rarities

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
From pioneering Expedition

8
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:24,832
Big trucks to the world's tallest mountains the North Pole

9
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,856
And the Moon

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,928
Woolly Mammoth tusks frame a fireplace

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,048
A menacing polar bear towers near The Landing with claws at the reading

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,072
And a cheetah

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,632
Rumored to have been shot by Teddy Roosevelt

14
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,912
Sits on a plinth

15
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,448
Just upstairs

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,776
The Gathering was an honor of a new Expedition

17
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,800
Wanted search

18
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,336
Not a single animal

19
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
1000

20
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,664
Best reporter Caitlin Swanson

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,736
The club was hosting a biological senses

22
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,552
An ecological survey so difficult

23
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,856
So complicated so taxing

24
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,160
But it has never been attempted before

25
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,952
And may never be attempted again

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
It is

27
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,304
A really big

28
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,584
Project

29
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
Like no I don't think

30
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,168
We've ever been involved in

31
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,448
A project of this scope

32
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,984
In our lives

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
It's like

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,568
Moving a little a small alarm me around

35
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
This is Jamie Allen

36
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,408
The census was his idea

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,944
And when he started

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
It was a small operation

39
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,856
But now Jamie is merely the tip of a vast pyramid of census related personnel

40
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,648
Including a logistics chief

41
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,696
Chief cartographer of veterinarian

42
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,280
An epidemiologist a specialist from the fish and wildlife service

43
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
And of course

44
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
The web team

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
And that's just

46
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,632
The core staff

47
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
Below them are the

48
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
The foot soldiers

49
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,752
The volunteers who must go out into the field

50
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,776
And do the actual

51
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:53,152
Counting 300 plus volunteers counting 700 hectares I remember hundred meter

52
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
+ 3000

53
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,760
Plus sheets of paper that we have to it's

54
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,064
Yeah Avast filings

55
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,600
Multiple office

56
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
And a team of hundreds

57
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
All for the sake of answering one question

58
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,768
I want to know how many squirrels are in Central Park

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
Squirrels

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
They're counting at squirrels

61
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:20,032
Dates October 14th 2018 time

62
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:25,408
526

63
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,456
On a chilly Sunday evening

64
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,992
I'm following stew

65
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,808
One of the Central Park census volunteers

66
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,344
Around the parks in Northern NJ

67
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,160
Run hide for Eastern gray squirrel

68
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
Which is like the squirrel

69
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,768
It's what you'll find in just about any American city

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
But especially Central

71
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,120
So we need to be on the 10th down there okay

72
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
Well I'm going to

73
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
Absentia

74
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,544
Following is we we had off the path

75
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:57,920
Over fences in through tile brush

76
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,248
We're slowly making our way to his designated area

77
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,040
Hectare 38e

78
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,392
Hectares are plots of land that measure a little less than 2 and 1/2 acres each

79
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,024
The job of a census volunteer is to count all the squirrels they can find within their assigned hectares

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
And only

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
Verisign hectares

82
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,192
Although this doesn't stops you from getting incredibly excited by every squirrel

83
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,056
Don't tell anybody you know in my hector

84
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
Buck

85
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
See you later

86
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,944
After every hectare in the park has been surveyed

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,344
All the data will get plugged into a wildlife counting formula popularized by the great mid-century Danish Amir

88
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
Squirrel biologist

89
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,648
Monthly car

90
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:44,768
If only will account for squirrels that were double counted and ones no one managed to find

91
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,608
And then finally spit out a number that the world has been waiting for

92
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
The squirrel abundance number

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,520
The total population of eastern gray squirrels in Central Park

94
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
Give or take

95
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,896
At which point you would be totally justified in asking as many do

96
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
What precisely is a point

97
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
And knowing the squirrel abundance number

98
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
What they're saying is like

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
You're counting squirrels like

100
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
Squirrels have a specific

101
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Contacts

102
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
In people's minds

103
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,791
And it's to be ignored like it's assumed I think that

104
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,863
Because they're so common we know everything we need to know about squirrels

105
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
But it's true

106
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
The very fact

107
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,263
But no one has bothered to do a Central Park Squirrel census before

108
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Together this most

109
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
Basic of data points about when the most common animals in our landscape reviews I kind of societal blind-spot we have in

110
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,223
Regards to squirrels

111
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
For a long time now

112
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
We're taking them for granted

113
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
Including the story

114
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
Where all this world came from the sky

115
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:53,119
Girls we see in our cities and towns are so everyday so ubiquitous so

116
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Just

117
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
There

118
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,983
That is easy to assume they've always been there

119
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
But the truth is

120
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
They haven't

121
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
Mid-nineteenth century

122
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
You could walk

123
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,431
To a place like Boston or Philadelphia

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
Manhattan

125
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
And you would not see a single squirrel

126
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
This is Etienne Benson

127
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,135
He's a historian of environmental science at the University of

128
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Pennsylvania

129
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,231
And he says the cities of the early nineteenth century

130
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255
We're effectively

131
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Querulous

132
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,839
These were animals you could only see if you left

133
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399
And then even perhaps left the farm

134
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
Rachel went deep into the woods

135
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,287
And it was only when you went deep into the woods that you would have a chance to see something

136
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,871
Like a squirrel infect squirrels were considered so elusive

137
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
The very wealthy

138
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,943
I'd like to keep them as exotic pets

139
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,039
In 1856 an article in the New York Times described

140
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
A one-touch pet

141
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
Escaped from its owner's home in Manhattan

142
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,671
And when it was discovered in a tree

143
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
A crowd of people gathered in amazement

144
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
Trying to lower it down

145
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
Eventually the crowd grew so large and rowdy

146
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
The police

147
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
Had to forcibly disperse

148
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,215
So how do these eastern gray squirrels

149
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
These are exclusive Woodland creatures

150
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
Make their way into urban spaces

151
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
Well for starters is Etienne

152
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
They didn't

153
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
At least not on the road

154
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,783
What was so fascinating to me was to find out that they have been intentionally introduced

155
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
The squirrels that we all take for granted as we

156
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
Walk to the park

157
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
On our way to the gym or the office

158
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,487
Are only there because we put them there

159
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
They were deliberately brought into cities

160
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
And fed

161
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:27,839
And shelter

162
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,959
The first city that we know of to introduce squirrels was Philadelphia in 1847

163
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
Like many East Coast cities of the mid-nineteenth century

164
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,335
It was already a highly Urban environment

165
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
People urine for a taste of the wilderness

166
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,943
That the squirrel was seen to embody

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
They were captured in

168
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,527
The Wilderness brought into the city

169
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
And placed on a single tree

170
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
Almost as if they were animals

171
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
In a menagerie or a zoo

172
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,743
The tree was in the middle of a small public

173
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,815
Square and it was equipped with a wooden shelter and offense

174
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,631
So the squirrels could stay safe from the elements

175
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,215
And any would-be predators in their little squirrel home

176
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,775
A few other cities like Boston

177
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Replicate

178
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
First the number of squirrels

179
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
With teeny tiny

180
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,455
Philadelphia started out with only three

181
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,247
Think of it as a trial run

182
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
Only this first trial run

183
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
It went terribly

184
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,927
When I started working on this topic I thought okay you introduce a few squirrels into an urban

185
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
Park

186
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,255
In a few years you're going to have 2002 Scrolls no problem

187
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
At the very beginning

188
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,351
They were essentially incapable of Survivor

189
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,703
The cities of the 19th century just didn't have the kind of large Park

190
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239
An extensive tree cover we see

191
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,055
When you thought about Urban landscapes

192
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
Are very unfriendly

193
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,407
To an animal that required trees for food

194
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,735
In the classic storybook image of a squirrel

195
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
Always clutching in a car

196
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
And then that's basically true

197
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,903
Wild Squirrel requires deciduous nut bearing plants such as Oaks

198
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
In order to survive

199
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Without trees

200
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
If the city had to provide for

201
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:00,767
The squirrels

202
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,351
But the squirrel feed often proved to be either insufficient

203
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
Are nutritionally worthless

204
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,703
So those first squirrels either died off

205
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
Were killed

206
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Word opposites

207
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:17,919
In 1855 the reporter for the Boston evening transcript describe the introduction of squirrels

208
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
As quote

209
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,503
Absurd and reprehensible experiment

210
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
Which raises the question

211
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,647
Why are there no squirrels everywhere in American cities

212
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,231
I think it's more a model of if you build it they will come

213
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
Gabriel Willow is a nacho

214
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,071
Who specializes in animals

215
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Species that live in urban environment

216
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,215
Study nature and educate people about the natural world

217
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,263
Specifically in New York City

218
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
And he says that in the late 19th century

219
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,151
Green spaces like New York's were undergoing a transformation

220
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
Areas of open land

221
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,295
When's multi-purpose field used for everything from cattle grazing

222
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,343
Slaughterhouses in Malaysia training

223
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
Being transformed into

224
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
Spaces of leisure

225
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,463
And by the 1870s

226
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,279
$3 we're leaving behind small busy

227
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
P-Square

228
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
In favor of large

229
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Idyllic Park

230
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,423
And although they were designed for people

231
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
These new Urban Oasis

232
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,823
Just might be the best thing to ever happen to the eastern gray squirrel

233
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
The parks weren't just big

234
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,455
They were also designed to mimic the natural world

235
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,783
Take Central Park and Prospect Park in New York for example

236
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,831
Both designed by Calvert vaux

237
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
And Frederick Law Olmsted

238
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,439
Existing geology in hydrology

239
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:38,559
They took naturally existing small ponds or marshy areas and made

240
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
Lakes out of them

241
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
They also chose to

242
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
To keep the areas dramatic Rocky outcrop

243
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
Instead of blasting them away

244
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
That's been done with the rest of

245
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
How do you spread and so they were working with certain natural elements

246
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,175
These Natural Parks were filled with Hedges and lakes and streams

247
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
And lots and lots of trees

248
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Including

249
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,319
To the great Fortune of squirrels everywhere

250
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
Oak trees

251
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,183
Red Oak is very common white oak is very common pin oak is very common

252
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
There's a lot of acorns around

253
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
Everything a would-be squirrel residence

254
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Might want or need

255
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
It was in this

256
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
Oak dotted Acorn strewn landscape

257
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
Central Park in 1877

258
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,287
But a handful of eastern grey squirrels were introduced

259
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
For a second

260
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Trial run

261
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
And it was not landscape that the squirrels

262
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,711
Virtually exploded in population

263
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:33,599
By the turn of the century what had started as just a few dozen squirrels now numbered in the

264
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,927
Actually this is around the time that people just stop counting

265
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
I mean how could you with

266
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
So many squirrels running around

267
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,607
Guesses range from the high hundreds to over 5000

268
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
In Central Park & Beyond

269
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,495
Squirrels became a commonplace is fire hydrants and telephone poles

270
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
No the other Newfound accessories of the urban landscape

271
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,663
And is this new approach to Urban Parkland spread to other cities

272
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,223
So did the idea of populating them

273
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Squirrels

274
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,319
Eastern gray squirrels were introduced again

275
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,879
The place is like Philadelphia and Boston

276
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Unwelcome

277
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
Seattle Vancouver in San Francisco

278
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,791
Eastern Grays were also introduced overseas

279
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,095
England Italy in South Africa

280
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:22,495
It wasn't just the oak trees in these newly Lush environment that we're providing sustenance for the squirrels

281
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
At the time

282
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,103
People considered it their moral duty to feed them

283
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,455
Up until the early Twentieth Century the dominant

284
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
Way of understanding

285
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,319
The proper relationship between humans and animals in the city

286
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
Is it centered on charity

287
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
Is centered on the idea that humans

288
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
Have an obligation or responsibility

289
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,535
To create a friendly welcoming environment

290
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,583
For certain kinds of animals to flourish

291
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,423
PDL city was one that provided a home for good animals

292
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
And banish the bad

293
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
So if you go back even and read like

294
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
John James audubon's account

295
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
A bird species

296
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
He might talk about the bloodthirsty

297
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
Hardcore it's a

298
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Wiley

299
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,551
Raven and shoot Hawks and Falcons and Eagles

300
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
Because their predators because they were the other animals people

301
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Mean

302
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,975
Whereas other animals like pigeons and of course squirrels

303
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
We're considered peaceful

304
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
More than that they interacted with

305
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
The site of a non-domesticated animal

306
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Not only approaching you

307
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,239
Effectively communicating with you by soliciting food

308
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
Was a sign that civilized nature

309
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
So is only proper that you

310
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
Feed them

311
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,711
Estranged labor gave these wild animals and the residents who brought them into the city

312
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
A name

313
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
The more than human community

314
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
Stadium is to create a kind of

315
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,647
Fantasy world

316
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
In which

317
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
Every

318
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,767
Animal that is in the city is a living

319
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
Peacefully

320
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
With the others

321
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
At the Indulgence of the humans.

322
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
Around the place

323
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
Thanks for the more than human Community model

324
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
Urban squirrels live large

325
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
For decades

326
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,639
Nuts trees in humans feeding them extra food and killing off all their predators

327
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
They had it made

328
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,319
And in the case of New Haven for example there's even an article that I found that describes them as becoming so obese that they be

329
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
The fall from the trees

330
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
As the 19th century led into the 20th

331
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
And the squirrels were busy spreading out into

332
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,023
Suburban addicts in college campuses

333
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
No one stopped to wonder

334
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
If there could be such a thing as

335
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
Is too many squirrels

336
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
But as hard as it is to admit

337
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
There is no evidence to suggest

338
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,519
There might actually be

339
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Too many

340
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
There is an ongoing

341
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,247
Matthew Harper is an information security expert

342
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
With 20 years of experience

343
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,623
And he says when it comes to threats to the US power Network

344
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Forget to write

345
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Forget Russian hacker

346
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,023
Send the case of the utility infrastructure

347
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,095
Humble squirrel that's causing most of the issues

348
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:01,215
By some estimates one out of every five power outages in United States

349
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Are squirrel related

350
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
To be fair to the squirrel

351
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
They really start out with the best of intention

352
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
Squirrels need to build nests

353
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
And they usually build their nests

354
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Intrigued

355
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,295
They also build them in anything that looks like a

356
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
Like utility poles

357
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Transformers

358
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
And like all rodents

359
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
A squirrel's incisors

360
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
Never stop growing

361
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
Do they have to chew to keep them filed down

362
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,095
They mostly chew bark and branches and nuts

363
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
They also choose

364
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
Things like power

365
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
Inevitably

366
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Some unlucky

367
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Squirrel

00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Powerline

370
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,615
Or step onto exposed wires at the same time and

371
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Oh

372
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,199
Killing the squirrel

373
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Ensuring the system

Keep track of all those systems Schwartz Matthew runs website

00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,927
Which is a website which tracks

377
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
Squirrel activities

378
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,535
And attacks against the power grid

379
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
This is real

380
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
Cypress Grill

381
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:05,215
A big map marking the largest power outages caused by squirrels in the past 30 years

382
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
Take a year and you can find hundreds

383
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
Depends indicating squirrel incident

384
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Laid out across

385
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,383
Lower 48 in Canada

386
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,223
There's a drop-down menu if you want to see how much is caused by other animals

387
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
But don't bother

388
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
When it comes to power problems

389
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
It's mostly the squirrels

390
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
Can you give me some examples of

391
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,671
Squirrel related power outages

392
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
All right I'm just pulling it up now

393
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,535
Squirrel

394
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,935
Last year 2018 College in California xidan happened

395
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Cancel classes

396
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,615
Then in November of 2018 a single roving squirrel knocked out three substations in Upstate New York

397
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
Causing a string of power outages

398
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
For more than 12000 people

399
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
13 months

400
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,903
Another squirrel took at a polling station in Virginia on the day of the presidential election

401
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,999
Squirrel cut the power of an entire shopping mall in South Carolina

402
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
One week before Christmas

403
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,423
Taylor case in Canada back in April of impacted 55000 people

404
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
And those are just the big ones

405
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
In Austin Texas

406
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,847
Squirrels were responsible for over 400 separate outages

407
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Kids in 20s

408
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
15 alone

409
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
But the greatest

410
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,783
Rodent related outage of all occurred in December of 1987

411
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:27,903
In the last place you'd ever expect to find an electrocuted squirrel

412
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
That story and more

413
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
SS

414
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
Between the beats

415
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,055
Bongs and chatter of our devices

416
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,639
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

417
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:54,271
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

418
00:16:54,527 --> 00:17:00,159
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remembrall hearing that voice

419
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,951
Technology talk to us

420
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,255
It is a creation of Sonic trash

421
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,071
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

422
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,655
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

423
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
To make them more human

424
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
Turn the living room lights on

425
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Okay

426
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
Dim the living room lights to 50

427
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
80%

428
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Okay

429
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,343
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

430
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,159
Makes for a much more natural experience

431
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
Turn the living room lights on

432
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
Dim the living room lights to 50

433
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
Resent

434
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:45,727
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

435
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
About how are sounds gay

436
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
Is impacting our health

437
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

438
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,175
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

439
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,223
Right here on the 99.

440
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
It happened on December 9th

441
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
1987

442
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,743
It's kind of sad for me because I am a true animal lover

443
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
Member of the New York

444
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,095
That means you used to be one of those guys

445
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,911
ET yelling and screaming on the trading room floor

446
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
And it's simply this

447
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,239
Back in the day

448
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
Yell back in 1987

449
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,359
The New York Stock Exchange was

450
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
Everything to the world

451
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
Backbend in the 80s

452
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,551
Exchange control 85% of the global stock market

453
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
And search Raiders like Joe

454
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
They were the kings of Wall Street

455
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:40,511
We was a place to go we was so proud to wear all White badges with all numbers on it

456
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
And

457
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,815
Say we were

458
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange

459
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,239
But there was also another Exchange in town that was slowly chipping away at their market share

460
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Their biggest rival

461
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
NASDAQ

462
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,103
The NASDAQ with an automated

463
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
It ran on computers

464
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
It didn't need Floor Traders

465
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,759
And the Traders at the New York Stock Exchange

466
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
NBA trades in person by hand

467
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
He did it

468
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:11,999
SoJO still remembers the Glorious Day a rumor began to spread among the 4,000 traitors on the floor

469
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
For the exchange

470
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
We start hearing

471
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,863
Dennis extricated technical glitch

472
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:22,495
And yell by the time I got from one end to exchange the other might might have took about 30 seconds

473
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,823
Attic just Word of Mouth it just flies

474
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,383
Finally the electronic ticker tape

475
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,199
Scrolling along one of the walls of the exchange

476
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
Lit up with the news

477
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,759
Spend the ticket ape

478
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,343
The Turkey Thicket empresses flight across end

479
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
And we know

480
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
Their deepest

481
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
Darkest wish had come true

482
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
NASDAQ

483
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
FL

484
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,303
It was really a magnet it was a dream

485
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
And

486
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
The trading floor

487
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
Erupted

488
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
I mean you could ever Stephanie

489
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,031
482 minutes on December 9th 1987

490
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
NASDAQ was offline

491
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
Losing an estimated 20 million trade

492
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,991
And then we find out that it was a squirrel

493
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,111
A squirrel had chewed through a power line in Connecticut or NASDAQ tree with electricity

494
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,183
But it did not affect the New York Stock Exchange

495
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,535
Much to be Everlasting Joy of traitors like Joseph Sanju Amino

496
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,095
Should NASDAQ that's quarrel

497
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,143
That squirrel was Godzilla

498
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:27,007
To us on the New York Stock Exchange that little squirrel with Superman

499
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
Equation for

500
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,823
80 minutes

501
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
We were the Kings again

502
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
Set alarm for 2 a.m.

503
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,711
The score will pay the ultimate price you know for our

504
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,039
You hours of Glory that particular day

505
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,671
Squirrels have also been wreaking havoc overseas

506
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
In Great Britain

507
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,535
Eastern gray squirrels introduced in 1876

508
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,095
Quickly began to displace the native red

509
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Squirrel

510
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
Driving it to near Extinction

511
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,191
In the eastern gray squirrel might be

512
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
Acute

513
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,007
The red squirrel is super cute

514
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
Can Google it

515
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Is the love

516
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,615
And now there's only a few small pocket

517
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
Cuz the red squirrels left

518
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
In northern England and Scotland

519
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,759
This despite a massive eradication can

520
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
To keep the American Invaders out of

521
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
The Scottish Highlands

522
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
And you're up

523
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
They're officially an invasive

524
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Species

525
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,328
But even as American squirrels were taking out shopping malls and stock exchanges in invading foreign countries

526
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,144
The very things that allowed them to proliferate in the first place

527
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,448
We're slowly being taken away

528
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,008
Starting the mid-twentieth century

529
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,592
Ecologist Wildlife managers and park officials

530
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
Started to re-examine Americas

531
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
Approach to Wildlife

532
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,992
They began to argue that Predators like coyotes and Hawks

533
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,832
Should no longer be hunted for the sake of a more than human community

534
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,392
That starts get replaced with an i really different

535
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,768
Privacy ecological view in which we understand those relationships are predation essential

536
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,816
To ecosystem as a whole

537
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,864
In his new ecological model

538
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,472
The ideal environment was no longer one that correspondent two Notions of civilized

539
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
Versus uncivilized species

540
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
But one in which a variety of

541
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
Predator and prey alike

542
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Maintain

543
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
World population balance

544
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,736
With only minimal human intervention

545
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,344
It took a few decades for this idea to spread from the national parks into the city

546
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,160
But by the 1980s it had arrived

547
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
Along with the Predators

548
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:26,048
Which ecological reminded naturalist by Gabriel Willow

549
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,328
Is a wonderful thing

550
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
Coyotes

551
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,680
Are coming back on the road and we're not bringing them back

552
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:36,544
Ravens Ravens

553
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,104
The red-tailed hawk came back of its own accord

554
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,480
Other species we intentionally reintroduced like peregrine falcons and their thriving New York City

555
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,808
Has the highest population density of peregrine falcons in the world

556
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,392
For most of us the death of a few squirrels

557
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
Seems like a small price

558
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,976
Japan exchange for his Newfound biodiversity

559
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,792
Today there's no shortage of webcams

560
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,352
Set up by people who have discovered the Hawks Nest

561
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,400
Outside their 12th floor apartment Window

562
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,984
And while we've been busy welcoming the squirrels Predators back

563
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,264
I can do our cities

564
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,336
We've also begun to finally withdraw our charity

565
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:16,736
I think everybody should go check out squirrels they're pretty cool I'm Pro squantum squirrel

566
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:22,880
Gabriel and other natural has been feeding squirrels has no place in the new ecological model

567
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,184
Providing bread and other unnatural

568
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
Whole Foods

569
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
Can lead to a variety of

570
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,072
An acclimating squirrels to hand feeding

571
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,376
Can make them overly dependent on humans

572
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,448
And possibly pruned unstable population boom

573
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,520
None of which is ultimately good for the squirrel

574
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
Or the larger environment

575
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,664
Which is why 142 years after welcoming squirrels in

576
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,968
The fold of are more than human community

577
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
New York City

578
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,784
Is done giving hand

579
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Good morning

580
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,368
March 1st 2019

581
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,648
What time is 12:05

582
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
Fritz Recreation

583
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
This past winter

584
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
New York City Parks

585
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,792
Department held a hearing

586
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
For proposed rule

587
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
That would make it illegal

588
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,912
Defeat any wild animal in the park

589
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,472
Attended solicit comments regarding the

590
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Goodyear oil change

591
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
He's coming to become part

592
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,360
Gabriel Willow was there too

593
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,664
Although it didn't go down by the way he thought it

594
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
I didn't really expect

595
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,248
It to be quite eschewed

596
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:25,088
As it was in terms with almost everybody there was speaking against the regulations

597
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:29,440
Is criminal act that runs against the morals and rules of a civilized society

598
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,280
New York hospitals that the squirrels

599
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,864
Bishop doing the wild

600
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,192
The parks off the light

601
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,008
I don't know that I've

602
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
Encountered that many

603
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
Squirrel and pigeon

604
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,896
Ceiling fans in one place before

605
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:52,480
And I'll do the animals should be eating healthy food

606
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,016
They were not buying into

607
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,296
Ecological model

608
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:59,136
The parks are all are not nature there an artificial situation

609
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,952
We are part of your environment

610
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:07,328
When people Express concern that certain animals in certain Parks might starve

611
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
Gabriel

612
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,144
Tried to stand up for the hands off

613
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
Problem

614
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
But the Applause was tepid

615
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:27,552
Received founder and director of the wild bird fund

616
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
She was also against me

617
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,392
Take the proposed amendment to the rule

618
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,720
That's awesome in Chinese food

619
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,376
Exactly what effect

620
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,960
The blanket ban would have on wildlife populations is unclear

621
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,264
But regardless of the ecological impact

622
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,568
The biggest takeaway from the hearing

623
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,384
Was that the concept of the more than human community

624
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
That was still going strong

625
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,992
I'm here today as a voice for New York

626
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,040
Cities non-human residence

627
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,392
Because I see what's happening to our Wildlife Neighbors

628
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,672
As really

629
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
Truly tragic

630
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
The feeling that these animals

631
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,840
Our fellow citizens and should be treated with the same consideration

632
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
Has never fully gone away

633
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,264
It is not just about what we want it's about what the squirrels and all of the other than human beings

634
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
In our parks

635
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,848
Want to and they are constituents of New York City

636
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
I go to the park

637
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,176
People loved

638
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,712
Feed the animals in the park

639
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,016
On any park bench in any City

640
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,576
You'll see people throwing crumbs to the birds

641
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
And the birds approaching for more

642
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,184
It's one way we feel a connection to Nature

643
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,976
For just a moment

644
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,792
Both human and animal are doing something together

645
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,352
That shared experience between species

646
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,680
That's what the people that hearing didn't want taken away

647
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:53,056
Gabriel willow also believes that there is value in connecting with these animals

648
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,384
But he sees it as a reason not to feed them

649
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,432
I think people really

650
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:04,832
Crave a direct interaction and connection with nature and

651
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Please

652
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Go to the park

653
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
Observe wildlife

654
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,720
Feel that connection

655
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,512
You don't need to touch them you don't eat

656
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,072
To pet them you don't need to hold them you don't need to feed them like

657
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
It's actually more

658
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,168
Interesting and more valuable to stand back

659
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,216
An animal

660
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
Exhibiting amor

661
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
Natural behavior

662
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,872
What does grow long enough and you'll see it played tricks another squirrel

663
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,456
It's a squirrel carrying an acorn believes it's being watched

664
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,992
It will dig a hole

665
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,296
Pantomime putting the acorn in the hole

666
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,088
And then cover the whole back up

667
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,904
Although hiding the relay coordinates now

668
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,952
Just to throw its fellow squirrels

669
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:47,584
Squirrels have been seen carefully organizing their acorns by size and shape

670
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
Before they bury them

671
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,960
Biologists believe it's a mnemonic device that helps the squirrels remember

672
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
What they buried where

673
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:59,360
They have a specific call when I see a predator so if you learn a little bit of squirrel language

674
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,664
Like I know I know the hot call

675
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,224
So if I hear that I'll look up and often see a hawk

676
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,552
So for them to just sort of allow us to be there

677
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,088
But go about their

678
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
Day-to-day

679
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Life

680
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
Is so much more powerful for me

681
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:18,816
There's more than one way to connect to the animals with whom we share our cities

682
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,400
Whether it's listening to that yet being of coyotes in the middle of the night

683

Singapore webcam

684
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,472
For the hawk nest outside your window

685
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,800
Or counting all the squirrels in Central Park

686
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,664
In March Jamie Allen and the other team members of the squirrel census

687
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,456
Finished Gathering their data

688
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,272
They plan to reveal the squirrel abundance number

689
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
In June

690
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,904
Etienne Benson says he doesn't know how many squirrels are in Central Park

691
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,464
But he thinks he does understand

692
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,512
Why everyone is so eager to find out

693
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,048
You're one of the appeals of it

694
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
Criss cross answers

695
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376

699
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,008
It's scared of people

700
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,800
That the world around them

701
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:06,432
It's not the only inhabited by humans that it's it is this multi-species

702
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,456
Class

703
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,296
Can I think there is a need and a desire there

704
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:16,416
To know something about your neighbors but since this is a form of appreciation

705
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,000
A way of recognizing that the squirrels are there

706
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
And that

707
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
In itself

708
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
