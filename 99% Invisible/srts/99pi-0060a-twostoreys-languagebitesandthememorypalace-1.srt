This is 99% invisible

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,600
So earlier this month

24
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,952
We wrapped up the 99 percent invisible kickstarter fundraising campaign

25
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
And it was amazing

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,072
We had 5661 backers

27
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
Raised over a hundred and seventy

28
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
That was not what I was expecting

29
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,688
Huge show support for the program around the world it was the highest-earning

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
Federalism project in Kickstarter history

31
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:03,904
So we're gearing up for season 3 and it won't be long it's going to be in September so just a few weeks couple weeks

32
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:09,280
But I've got a few thousand envelopes to stuff and we got to get salmon pack and get everything

33
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,840
Working in order another word together

34
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,936
And rather than doing repeats or just making you wait for the new season

35
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,496
I'm going to prison stories from producers that I love

36
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,080
But who didn't actually produce these stories for 99percentinvisible

37
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
When you hear them

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408
I'm pretty sure you're going to figure out why I thought that

39
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,968
Be perfect for the show in terms of the subjects they cover

40
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
And why I thought

41
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,272
You love him too

42
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Our first

43
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Short story

44
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,832
Verity

45
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,160
Very short stories from Ireland it's a series called Language by

46
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
Language

47
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
Story

48
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
Doors opening

49
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,704
Have you ever wondered why in levels are floor in a building is called a story

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,056
Doors closing that's a word we associate with a narrative or tail

51
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,688
I'm actually it's not far off the origin of the word we associate with architecture

52
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,576
And it's used Texas back to the 14th century

53
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,416
The word story comes from the ancient Greek word

54
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
Astoria

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,976
Meaning account of events

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,584
And it's hurting hundreds architecture in the habit of decorating buildings

57
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
Stained glass

58
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,656
And stone carvings are sculptures

59
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,288
These carvings were on the outside of the building and they depicted actual stories

60
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,616
Ancient myths

61
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,920
Legends

62
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,248
And on churches and Cathedrals they often depicted Bible stories

63
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,808
So you can see where this is going

64
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,392
The higher the building the more stories that had

65
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,024
And eventually the word story was used to refer to an entire floor or level

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
First story

67
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,448
Language bites is produced by Colette kinsella sound design by Lachlan

68
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,288
The series was produced for and first broadcast on RTE choice

69
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
In Ireland

70
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,808
Are the extra pieces from Nate dimeo the memory Palace

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,696
They produced episode number 27 of 9 amps in the visible long ago but his connection with the show does not in there

72
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,303
They was one of the first people I called when I started 99percentinvisible because essentially

73
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,679
I want to do stories like he was doing on the subject of history but I want to do the about architecture and Design

74
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,031
So if you're already familiar with 9 episode invisible deal here they share DNA

75
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
The Memory Palace

76
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
This story is called Dam

77
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
This is the memory

78
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Anita Mann

79
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
1931

80
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
The height of the depression

81
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,927
People began hearing that you're going to be jobs in Nevada

82
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,255
Dunedin men there to build an enormous dad

83
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,815
That would be named after President Herbert Hoover

84
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
5000 man

85
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,167
Former Commodities Traders former Austin

86
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,751
Actor families in drove to the desert

87
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,919
Some of them leaving behind the plywood and scrap metal Shanty towns that were also named after Herbert Hoover

88
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:11,807
When they got there they found that there were jobs but that the houses in schools in movie theaters that were supposed to be there

89
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
I've been built

90
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,159
So they Hammerton post into the ground

91
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,231
And strung up some sheets that could keep the Desert Sun off

92
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
Kids and their wives

93
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
He went to work

94
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
96 of those men died

95
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,191
When the harnesses that fasten them to the canyon wall

96
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
800 feet in the air

97
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Snap

98
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,591
When the hearts are 50 year old man who are you still selling women's hosiery

99
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
Teaching geometry

100
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,711
When their hearts give out after working 10-hour shifts

101
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:45,599
130 degree heat chipping a mile long tunnel beneath a Desert Ridge

102
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
When others fell into wet concrete

103
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Young people now

104
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,791
Before they die then before the concrete set

105
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,887
New became a permanent part of a large Public Works project

106
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
But not long after they finish the Dan

107
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
Orange groves in alfalfa

108
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Fields

109
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
In baseball.

110
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
In whole city

111
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
Grow in the desert

112
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,247
There's a monument at Hoover Dam

113
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,807
32in normous bronze angels

114
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,391
That are supposed to embody the spirit of the man who designed and built the dam

115
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
American progress or whatever

116
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
But my favorite part of the monument

117
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
Everything but the whole damn damn

118
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,399
There's an article astronomical

119
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
Done in Toronto

120
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,823
Interesting texter that tells you that on September 20th 1935

121
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,639
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated to

122
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,223
The text goes on to explain that the chart on the ground

123
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
Does the precise alignment of Heaven

124
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,599
Exactly 856 when FDR spoke

125
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
The same moment that a flagpole

126
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695
It stands between the two angels

127
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
Beijing street at the heart of the Sun

128
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
Because they were sure we would

129
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
There's a separate section of the chart

130
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:08,031
But supposedly depicts the precise astronomical location of an Egyptian pyramid

131
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
When it was a line

132
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
Hoover Dam flagpole

133
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,175
With the Yonder star that the frankinson stone in Wiseman

134
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
Baby Jesus

135
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,015
Thereby ushering in the Christian era

136
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
I love it

137
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,647
Because it means it's so convinced where the makers of the Hoover Dam

138
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
It what these men had just built with so world

139
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
Sonu epic extremely awesome

140
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
Anna Paquin suffice

141
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
Survey designers chart

142
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,471
Working with astronomers at the Naval Observatory at the Smithsonian

143
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
Thousands of years from now

144
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
Even in an apparently post English world

145
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
When the text right there next to the chart

146
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
But somehow been rendered useless

147
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
Artcraft anyways

148
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,391
To be able to do the math and figure out the exact moment

149
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,719
When FDR had a clear in his calendar to say a few words

150
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,303
Now the 35th largest hydraulic

151
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,143
According to the state stores in website

152
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
The 9th best thing to do in the

153
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
Number 10

154
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:22,271
So that's the special 99percentinvisible for this week season 3 starts and very very soon but I thought this

155
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
Be more fun than

156
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,855
Playing a repeater waiting a month for new episode

157
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:31,231
Reporting new episodes a video episode a new website it's all coming this season M&M service

158
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
If you haven't done it already or this the first time your

159
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
During the show

160
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,215
Go download the 60-something previous episode of 99% invisible that are actually produced by me

161
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Girls shorts

162
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,543
They're Evergreen meaning the Third

163
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
Is timely now as they were when I made them

164
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Inderal

165
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
Good they're pretty good

166
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Is it by work I'm

167
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,527
Quite proud of absorb better than others but as a

168
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
There was a hole

169
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
All worth the time

170
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:05,535
Going to links to language bites and the Memory Palace on our website at 99percentinvisible. Org this program is a fraud

171
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,887
Kalw 91.7 local public radio in San Francisco

172
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,447
In the American Institute of Architects in San Francisco

173
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,407
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

174
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,223
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

175
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis talking to me in my

176
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:37,279
Wife is in another room in a hearing. Voice technology talk to us

177
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
It is a creation of Sonic trash

178
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:46,239
That's Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology
