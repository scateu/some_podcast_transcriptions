I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,936
Summer time in New York

24
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,984
Year is 1902

25
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,080
And II and wilhelm's printing company in Brooklyn has a

26
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,384
The problem that's producer Emmett Fitzgerald

27
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:24,992
They're trying to print the popular Humor Magazine judge

28
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,088
And it's really hot and there's a lot of humidity and they're having trouble

29
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,880
Getting the

30
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:35,232
Thanks to set properly on the page this is writer Stephen Johnson

31
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:40,096
Author of the book how we got to now he says the problem isn't so much the Heat

32
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
But the moisture in the air with warping the paper throwing the print out of alignment and so they hire a

33
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,800
Young enterprising engineer

34
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
By the name of Willis carrier to solve this problem and basically pull the moisture out of the air

35
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
Inside the printing plant and carrier developed the system that pumps air over cold metal

36
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
Coil

37
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,768
And it works it pulls moisture out of the air and the magazines are printed more efficiently and and that Banks

38
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Don't run

39
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
But

40
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,912
It has a side effect of as it's pulling moisture out of the air and also makes the air

41
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
A cooler

42
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
And so of course

43
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,800
Everybody wants to have lunch in the room with his new machine

44
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
It's like wow this is so nice

45
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
Because it's so much more pleasant

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,808
Carrier had invented air conditioner

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,184
And began to think that maybe his new technology could do more than just keep paper dry

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
Maybe it's

49
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,280
Something could actually be harnessed in the service or just human comfort

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
The first install system in textile Factory

51
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Tobacco plant

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,472
Other industrial workplaces that require low humidity

53
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,824
Is it really catches on in a very different

54
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,432
So before air conditioning the last place you would want to go

55
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
What's the crowd into a movie theater with a thousand other human beings on a day when I was 95

56
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
Degrees out right that would just be

57
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
Completely intolerable

58
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,488
The movie theaters really struggle to sell tickets

59
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
It's during the summer months

60
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,840
So carrier approaches a bunch of theater owners all around the

61
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Country with an idea

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
I'll install a new machine

63
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
That turns your place of business

64
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
Into a crisp

65
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
Cool Oasis

66
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,592
It won't be cheap but you'll make up for the cost in summer tickets

67
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
And that's exactly what happened

68
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:35,040
Peter owners advertise their chilled air and people came out to air condition theaters in droves

69
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,624
Yes you lucky people just sit back for a moment

70
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
Relax

71
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,952
I noticed the delightfully clean

72
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
Cool and refreshing

73
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,072
Atmosphere is scientifically air-conditioned theater

74
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
This advertisement

75
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
From the 1940s shows a bunch of

76
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
Theatregoers wearing fur parkas

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
Isis

78
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Ripping

79
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,616
Spinner

80
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:04,992
Suddenly movies went from being the last place you'd want to be on a summer day to being actually one of the nicer

81
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,600
And this whole tradition of having these big movies to come out in the summer

82
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Became pause

83
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
Summer blockbuster

84
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,488
But air conditioning would do a lot more than just

85
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Create the summer

86
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
Blockbuster

87
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
It would dramatically change what people in the United

88
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,887
It slipped in the design of our building

89
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
And homes

90
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,823
But the air-conditioning Revolution didn't happen all I want before World War II

91
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
Wealthy Elites had air conditioning systems installed in their Mansions but mechanically chill there was still seen as a

92
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,319
Luxury something to be enjoyed at the theater in your own home

93
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
Willis carrier wanted to change that

94
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,927
In a 1929 speech he said

95
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,047
Air conditioning and cooling for summer may become a necessity rather than a luxury

96
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
And we will look upon present times as marking the end of that dark age in which there was but relatively

97
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
Little cooling for human comfort

98
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,823
The big transformation for air conditioning

99
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,127
They really arrives after World War II

100
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,967
Is like so many stories of Technology really a story about

101
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
Miniaturization of

102
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,063
Something was really big and shrinking it down

103
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,367
Early AC systems were massive

104
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:18,207
Way too big for an individual home but by the late 1940s

105
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,815
Carrier and other companies were selling air conditioners that can fit in your window

106
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
But they were expensive

107
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
And it wasn't clear at first

108
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
That people would buy them

109
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
I think advertising

110
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
Play a huge role

111
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
In the increased use of

112
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
Air conditioning in the residential sector

113
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:40,991
And what's really interesting is that the advertising really played on the role of women

114
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
And their social status

115
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
This is Gail brager

116
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
She is an architecture professor at the UC Berkeley College of environmental design and an expert on thermal cup

117
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,327
If you look at the advertising in the 1950s a lot of them showed

118
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
Women dressed like

119
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
Beaver Cleaver's mom

120
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
With the pearls

121
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,495
And the gloved hands and

122
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
Dressed well

123
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,615
And it was really trying to associate on social status

124
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
With air conditioning

125
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
If you have air condition

126
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
You can live this life of leisure

127
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,831
And you wouldn't have to sweat with the toil of housework

128
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
Is that also played on the idea that

129
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
With air conditioning

130
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
Homeowners could take him

131
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
Control over nature

132
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
Mydesert 110 by day

133
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
Cool enough to need heat the same night

134
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,655
Here's an air conditioning commercial from the early 1960s that takes

135
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,751
Place in Palm Springs the maximum test for air conditioning

136
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
What system works best

137
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
Let's ask the owner of this desert show place

138
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
Miss Dinah Shore

139
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Hi

140
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
With my year-round gas air conditioning by arkla

141
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
I just touched the thermostat

142
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
Delightful Cooling

143
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
Uncomfortable heat in every room

144
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,671
Humidity control dust and pollen filter

145
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,975
My indoor climate is always perfect

146
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Is very compelling

147
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
The Advertiser

148
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,351
And I think that really played on

149
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,911
People adopting air conditioning more

150
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Into the home

151
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,543
In 1960 13% of homes in the United States had a c

152
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,615
By 1980 it was up to 55%

153
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
Today is close to ninety percent

154
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
In just a few decades

155
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,271
Is air conditioning went from luxury to necessity

156
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
Just as Willis carrier predicted

157
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,463
Has had a serious impact on how and maybe was profoundly where we live

158
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,279
All of a sudden there parts of United States that had

159
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Historically been

160
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,887
Really unpleasant to live in particular during the summer months

161
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,471
That's only because of these home air conditioning units

162
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Are now

163
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
Places to live

164
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,871
Population of States like Arizona and Florida

165
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Bloated

166
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,503
Adduction of of home air conditioning

167
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Really arguably one of the largest migrations

168
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,599
The people in the history of the night

169
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415
States moving from the north

170
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
To the South On To What We Now call the

171
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
The Sunbelt

172
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:05,887
If you could air condition your way through the summer than living in the middle of a desert or a human swamp

173
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
Was no big deal

174
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
In just 10 years

175
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Tucson

176
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
Went from 45 to

177
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
Some people

178
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
The 210,000 people

179
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
In the same decade

180
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
Houston almost doubled

181
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,807
And Florida during the 1920s had only a million people living there

182
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,647
But fifty years later there were nearly 7 million people in Florida

183
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,231
This Mass migration was so significant it changed the political

184
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,351
Increase population in States like Florida got more votes in the Electoral College

185
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,703
A lot of these new Southward migrants were conservative retirees

186
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
They tended to vote Republican

187
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,055
You begin to build this

188
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,847
Can a Republican

189
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,407
Sunbelt Coalition that didn't exist

190
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,759
And that Coalition is really crucial to Reagan's

191
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,319
Successful bid for the presidency in 1980

192
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,647
They were obviously a lot of different factors that led to Reagan

193
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,927
Can selection but

194
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
I think that

195
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:07,583
Had air conditioning not been invented Reagan might still have gotten elected but he would have required a different

196
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
Political coalition to make it pop

197
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,727
The population of the Sunbelt boom with the Advent of air

198
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,287
But it's not as if no one lived in these places

199
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
Before AC

200
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,871
Knows who did that developed lots of strategies

201
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
To beat the Heat

202
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,991
Including forms of vernacular architecture that were carefully attuned to the climate

203
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,855
Vernacular refers to traditional architecture that develops in a particular place

204
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,183
And it's often driven by local environmental conditions

205
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,255
If you look at traditional buildings in hot climate

206
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
Show me the elements are going to be

207
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Be different

208
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,631
If you're in a hot dryer hot humid climate

209
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
In the desert Southwest

210
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,239
Houses were traditionally built with Hefty material

211
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,311
Like Adobe and stone that can absorb heat

212
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,615
Is soaking up the heat during the day

213
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
Keeping it from getting inside

214
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,223
And then releasing it to the colder air

215
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
At night

216
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,063
Homes in the southwest also tended to have flat roofs

217
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:05,439
And small windows that can be closed up during the day and opened at night to let the cool area

218
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,815
However in the humid Southeast the vernacular architecture try to maximize shade

219
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
It was screened in sleeping porches

220
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Breezeway

221
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
It's between rooms

222
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:20,031
And cupolas in the roof to draw cool air up through the house

223
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,895
You tend to have much larger Windows much larger operable windows to the

224
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Tire

225
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
Passage to be opened up

226
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,271
You might have much larger shaded

227
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,599
Porches and balconies so there's a lot of outdoor living

228
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,439
And so you can you can look at the architecture and

229
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
It says something

230
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
About the place

231
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
On demand cold-air freed architects

232
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,143
The challenge of Designing a home that was unique

233
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
We Suited

234
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
The climate around

235
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
And as we got

236
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,311
More of a chemical systems and the power to

237
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Heat and cool

238
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,127
Buildings through mechanical

239
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
Call systems

240
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
Architect started relinquishing

241
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
Control

242
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
Oven bar mounts

243
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
Conditioning to the engineer's

244
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
Air conditioning systems were expensive

245
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,159
Home builders made up for the costs by cutting down on

246
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
Passive cooling features

247
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:14,303
And little by little the local Architectural Traditions rooted in the climate

248
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,119
Gave way too tightly sealed mass-produced

249
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Tractor

250
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
So a house in

251
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
The Southwest

252
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Might look

253
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,847
The same as a house in New Orleans which might look the same as a house in Minnesota

254
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:32,223
And whether you were in a hot humid hot dry or cold climate I think architecture

255
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,527
Really lost a sense of place

256
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,367
The rise of tract housing had to do with more than just Erica

257
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,719
It was influenced by the development of the highway system in the suburbanization

258
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
American Life

259
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
But AC enable the mass production of affordable homes that could exist in many different climate zones

260
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
Air conditioning didn't just

261
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,799
Change residential architecture it revolutionized the design of skyscrapers

262
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
Schools in office building

263
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,431
For air conditioning the only source of cool air with the outdoors

264
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,735
So offices usually have high ceiling

265
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
Lots of windows

266
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
People could open

267
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,111
And so all offices had at least one

268
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
Wall that was exposed to the

269
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,743
You might have Courtyards in the center of building

270
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,559
So that even the built those spaces that

271
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
Weren't on the street

272
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,911
Would have access to the air and light on

273
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
Inside

274
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:30,079
If you look at the floor plans of many mid-rise buildings from the early 20th century they often have these

275
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
Irregular shapes

276
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,663
It look like letters when viewed from above

277
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
So we sometimes

278
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
Just called them alphabet building

279
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,015
Thanks cuz they be in the shape of

280
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,319
E&H and I and O

281
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,183
But with air conditioning buildings could fill up the entire lot with offices.

282
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,511
Inside the core of the building nowhere near a window

283
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,583
Air conditioning also changed facade design

284
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,655
4AC address the issue of

285
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
Too much sun

286
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,519
By providing appropriate shadings or on a

287
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,871
Facades were carefully designed to avoid too much sun coming into a space

288
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:10,015
This is Lisa Hashem an architect who spent her career studying light in architecture

289
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,623
Discovered air conditioning all of a sudden we could have these continuous glass facades

290
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,159
Because we would solve the problem

291
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
With power conditioning instead of

292
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,095
Facade design or building design it was just Brute Force Power

293
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,423
Will air conditioner weigh out of all of these

294
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
Design it

295
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,615
Now this wasn't all a Bad Thing many modern Architects were happy to see the problem of thermal Comfort to the edge

296
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
It meant they could focus

297
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
Aesthetics

298
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
And so it was incredibly empowering

299
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,319
Architects to be able to relinquish that

300
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:51,487
With a c they were free to design the Sleek hermetically-sealed last hours that became Hallmarks of modern

301
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:57,375
It's safe to say that without air conditioning we would not have many of the Great modernist buildings of the 20th century

302
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
Oh absolutely not

303
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,055
But as a consequence the modern built environment in the United States is now totally dependent on air conditioner

304
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,151
A lot of our buildings would be uninhabitable in the summer without AC

305
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,503
And all that cool air requires a lot of power

306
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
We now use as much

307
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,111
Electricity for air conditioning as

308
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
We used

309
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,695
For all purposes in 1955

310
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
This is Stan Cox

311
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
Author of the book losing our cool

312
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,607
He says AC consumption has continued to rise

313
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
Vim 1993

314
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
The 2005

315
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:36,031
The amount of electricity used for air conditioning doubled Nationwide

316
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,847
One of the big reasons was that houses

317
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
We're getting larger

318
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,455
And virtually all of those newly constructed ones

319
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,039
Were getting central air installed in them

320
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,647
The larger the home the more space needs to be filled with cool air

321
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,487
It's crazy to think about it to me that

322
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Hohhot

323
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,071
Day here in Kansas

324
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
There are

325
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,655
3000 square foot houses

326
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
Being kept at

327
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
70 degrees

328
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,591
All day long and all the occupants are off it at work and school and so it

329
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,663
Not cooling a human being at all

330
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
In all that air conditioning might be keeping our buildings cool

331
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,551
Let's make in the outside world

332
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Hotter

333
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
The additional

334
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,695
Greenhouse emissions from Air Conditioning in the United States

335
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
Add up to about

336
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:32,095
500 million tons of CO2 equivalent

337
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Per year

338
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,447
He says that's more than the entire construction into

339
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,775
Including the production of materials like concrete

340
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
So what's up

341
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Very

342
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Significant amount

343
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,175
In fact in 2010 when Stan cockroaches book

344
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,015
He says the US was using as much energy for air conditioning

345
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,343
Has the entire continent of Africa was using

346
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,623
For all purposes

347
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,975
And all of these structures that require massive amounts of energy to key

348
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Keep cool

349
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
We've been

350
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
Boarding them to the rest

351
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
The world

352
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
Including really hot places

353
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
It's like Dubai

354
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,191
What American has been fantastic

355
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
Cost of boarding Dental design in art

356
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
Is making a brine Annex

357
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Sporting Good

358
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,359
However a lot of it architecture is non-responsive

359
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
To the conditions of The Middle

360
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
This is manit rastogi

361
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,551
An Indian architect and co-founder of the firm morphogenesis

362
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Space in New Delhi

363
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,903
He says that a lot of the buildings in Indian cities

364
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Is today

365
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:32,511
Look like they could be buildings in other City around the world

366
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,583
Sealed up glass towers that require a lot of air can

367
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:41,471
But India also have a long history of vernacular architecture design.

368
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
People cool

369
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,055
M Rastogi started looking back at some of the

370
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
These old buildings

371
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
And thought

372
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
We used to do this really well

373
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
Not so long back

374
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,015
Why are we building differently today

375
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,135
Rastogi has devoted his career to designing functional modern building

376
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
Borrow passive cooling techniques

377
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975
Traditional Indian architecture

378
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,023
And require very little

379
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Play Fanny air conditioner

380
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
Like it design

381
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
The Pearl Academy of fashion

382
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
So the Pearl Academy of fashion

383
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,519
Is on the outskirts of Jaipur which is essentially a desert climate

384
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,079
Went rastogi started working on the Pearl Academy

385
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,871
He looked at Old Indian buildings

386
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
In hot dry climates

387
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Inspiration

388
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
He studied Old Fort

389
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Sun Palace

390
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
The see how they stayed cool

391
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,831
And he was particularly impressed by a feature called the battle

392
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
Stepwell

393
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,695
Bellies are traditional Indian stopwatch

394
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
What's found in many old Palace

395
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:42,143
They're basically pools of water dug deep into the ground beneath the building and surrounded on all sides by descendants

396
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
Intricately carved

397
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
From Stone

398
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:50,591
The cool temperatures from underground combined with the evaporative cooling of the water to lower the temperature

399
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
Picture in the palace

400
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:56,735
Rastogi decided to put a modern take on this ancient architectural feature in his building

401
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,039
So we created about your step brother

402
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,087
Across the entire site

403
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
3 meters down into the ground

404
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,439
And we recycle all the water

405
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,255
Into that stepper condition allowed for

406
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,071
Evaporative cooling to come up and cool the side down

407
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,911
The top of the building is insulated using earthenware pot

408
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
And the sides of the building reboot

409
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,799
Locally manufactured jollies that keep the Sun out but let the light in

410
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:26,943
The Jolly is a traditional Indian architectural feature it's basically a lot of screen filled with all these

411
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
Any holes

412
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,783
What's that letting diffused sunlight without too much heat

413
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Let me put a whole life together

414
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,111
And when the project finished

415
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,671
We were getting temperature to 29 degrees

416
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,999
When the outside temperature was 46 degrees without air conditioning

417
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,071
In Fahrenheit that's 84 degrees inside the build

418
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,399
When it was 115 degrees outside

419
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
It's still hot

420
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,215
But doable

421
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:54,335
Turn office building that doesn't actually sound all that doable to me that sounds way too hot

422
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,711
Yeah I think so too but rastogi says that for someone used to living in Jaipur India

423
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
Pretty Pleasant temperature

424
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,807
He says thermal Comfort is relative

425
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,135
Standards for what constitutes thermal comfort

426
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
Is where I think the whole problem

427
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Sort of sick

428
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,815
Architects and Engineers around the world use thermal comfort

429
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:19,679
Set by the American Society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers

430
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
Historically the standard

431
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,567
Dictated a relatively narrow temperature window that all building should be kept

432
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:31,711
The only way to be certain that a building can meet that standard all year long is with lots of air conditioning and heating

433
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,039
But if you've ever worked in an office you know that some people are always hot

434
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Well others

435
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Katie

436
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
Are always cold

437
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
You will never

438
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,487
Achieve a static environment

439
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,767
Where hundred percent of

440
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,839
This is architect Lisa hatchimal

441
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,935
There's a huge amount of individual variation in what people

442
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Experience

443
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
And what they prefer

444
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,591
Are thermal preferences vary based on age and

445
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,639
And sex in the climate that were used to

446
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,199
But the whole goal of conditioning buildings is

447
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
How to create a static indoor climbing

448
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:09,599
One temperature that will hopefully be the least unpleasant the most number of people

449
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,391
Galebreaker cost

450
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,255
She and her team at UC Berkeley have developed new thermal

451
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
Allow

452
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
For a wider range of

453
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
Buildings

454
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,167
Breaker doesn't want to get rid of air

455
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
All together but

456
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,263
She thinks we can be more intentional about when and where we

457
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
Our

458
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
Environmental conditioning systems

459
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,871
Think about Heating and Cooling

460
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Spaces

461
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
Rather than Heating and Cooling

462
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,735
People says we don't need the key

463
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
Cool corridor

464
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
Words to the same degree as

465
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
The parts of an office worker

466
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
People spend most of their day

467
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,927
And she says we can save enormous amounts of energy

468
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,511
By letting the temperatures in buildings fluctuate over a wider range

469
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,839
And giving people more tools to heat and cool themselves

470
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,935
To do that it's going to take a combination of high and low Tech approach

471
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,751
A window that you can open right by your desk

472
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,287
Is a great personal cooling device

473
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
A sweater

474
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
It's a pretty good personal heating device

475
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,431
But also developing low-energy desk

476
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Foot warmers

477
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,015
And the chair I'm sitting in right now

478
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,807
You might see these dials

479
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,855
This is a heated and cooled chair

480
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
And this to me is

481
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,720
The ultimate form of a personal Comfort System we call it

482
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
PCS

483
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
Because we're all going to feel something different

484
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
And we could

485
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,728
Be sitting in the same environment but one person maybe feeling warm one person maybe

486
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
Feeling cool

487
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:35,104
And would you like to sit in this chair okay we're going to switch places

488
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
You going to stay the night for a while

489
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,296
People are getting more and more used

490
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
2

491
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
Heated seats

492
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
H&R cars

493
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
So why not have

494
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
Heated and cooled

495
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
H&R office that I'm going to Rich

496
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,024
Reach over internet

497
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Cooling

498
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,864
Okay and you should feel that pretty ugly

499
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
Yeah wow

500
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,704
It's blowing air

501
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,752
Cross your back your seat

502
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,824
Oh it's so nice that I have sometimes

503
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Had when my back

504
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,200
Reducing our Reliance on air conditioning

505
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,480
Is Austin frame as a loss

506
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
Giving up comfort

507
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,088
But neither deal-breaker morally to hedgehogs

508
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:22,976
Back in the seventies heschung wrote this beautiful little book called thermal Delight in architecture

509
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,328
And then it she argues that we should think about a perception of temperature as a sense

510
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,120
Just like any other sense

511
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
Temperature can causes

512
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
Discomfort

513
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
But I can also give us a lot of pleasure

514
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
Where the light

515
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,288
The feeling of a warm fire in the winter

516
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
Or Cool Breeze

517
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
Hot summer night

518
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,176
Or sliding back into your heated chair after a trip outside

519
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
She wrote about

520
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,088
How thermal experience could enrich architectural design add a new dimension

521
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,624
And it requires

522
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,696
Change it turns out the physiologic

523
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
The only way we can have that

524
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,144
Is to actually have some kind of variability in our lives

525
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,264
Deal breaker has done studies on thermal comfort in buildings around the world

526
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,056
And she's found that people actually prefer

527
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,848
Naturally ventilated building

528
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
Planes where they can open windows

529
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
I feel a little bit of control

530
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Over there around 10

531
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,248
Turns out that not only do you

532
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,784
Tolerate that you actually

533
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,832
Prefer a wider set

534
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
Of conditions

535
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
Today the average person spends

536
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,464
It's about 90% of their time indoors

537
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,048
And Gilbert doesn't think we should live so much of our lives

538
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
Thermal monotony

539
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,864
Imagine life

540
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
If we ate

541
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,168
The same food

542
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
Everyday

543
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,520
If we didn't have changing weather

544
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,080
And everything was the same all of the

545
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
Time

546
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,872
Beauty terrible

547
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,200
But that's essentially what we're trying to do in our building

548
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:54,368
Towards the end of my conversation with Gail I reluctantly offered to give her chair back should we switch

549
00:23:54,624 --> 00:24:00,768
Did you vacuum near me

550
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,728
I like my chair quite a bit

551
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,824
You should

552
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,808
Special things to architects

553
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:30,208
You have asked and I are going to talk about

554
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,280
Terrifying incoming missile false alarm in Hawaii

555
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
Between the beats

556
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,472
Bongs and chatter of our devices

557
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,056
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

558
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
If

559
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:52,480
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

560
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:56,576
All hearing that voice

561
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
Technology

562
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
He talked to us

563
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
It is a creation of Sonic trash

564
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,488
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

565
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,072
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

566
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,864
To make them more human

567
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
Turn the living room lights on

568
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
Okay

569
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,312
Dim the living room lights to 50%

570
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Okay

571
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:25,504
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

572
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
Mix

573
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,808
For a much more natural

574
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
Experience

575
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
Turn the living room lights on

576
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,696
Dim the living room lights

577
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
50%

578
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,048
We're presenting to

579
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,144
Special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

580
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

581
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,520
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

582
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,336
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

583
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Right here

584
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
We need to talk about something

585
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:03,392
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet

586
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
Size routine

587
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,208
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

588
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:12,608
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

589
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,912
Then it may be time to seek help

590
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:21,312
Go to oh my God. Info podcast we can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God

591
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,360
Infowars podcast

592
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Oh my God

593
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
Flash podcast

594
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
So a few months ago thanks in

595
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
Pretensions

596
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
With North Korea

597
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:34,624
The Hawaii Emergency Management agency started doing ballistic missile attack

598
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,672
But the other day

599
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
Someone was in the shade

600
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
Test alert

601
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,000
And apparently

602
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
Chose the wrong option from a list

603
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
A very confusing options

604
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
Easier to give

605
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,728
So at 8:07 in the morning

606
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
A message went out

607
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,288
Two cell phones in Hawaii

608
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,336
Ballistic missile threat

609
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
Inbound to Hawaii

610
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,408
Seek immediate shelter

611
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
This is not a

612
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
Within a few minutes

613
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,320
Officials knew it was a false alarm and started doing damage control

614
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,904
But natural Stand Down alert wasn't issued until 8

615
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
45

616
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
More than half an hour after it all

617
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,768
Okay so some officials in news outlets

618
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
Are calling to the prison

619
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
Set off the alarm

620
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
Three fire

621
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,376
Wall-E Touhou steam

622
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Colbert joked around about

623
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
But the opposite

624
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
The Agency Inc

625
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
Boy in question

626
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
Was reassigned

627
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,384
You keep him in that job

628
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
He's the one person

629
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
Planet Hulk

630
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,248
Will never ever make that mistake again

631
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,832
Do you know

632
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
Design Guru Don Norman

633
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
Also thinks

634
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
The focus is too much

635
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,072
The person whose basic argument is that if it's that easy to screw up

636
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
There's a design problem

637
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
Fax and I think it's safe to say that we

638
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
MPI

639
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
Are members of

640
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,496
Don Norman amen

641
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
And

642
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
Really there are a number of Zion

643
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,152
It was really easy to make this mistake and send out the alert

644
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,456
It's also too hard to retract it or issue

645
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Correction

646
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,040
And then there's this lack of detail on the method

647
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,344
Like where to find shelter

648
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,160
Oregon telephone numbers or links to websites that might

649
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,952
How people get update there more information

650
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,232
So people panicked

651
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
Many fearing the worse

652
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
Call loved one

653
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
I mean this is a very

654
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
High stakes

655
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
Design problem

656
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
A lot of solutions are being foot

657
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,032
Summit call producing more friction to the process to

658
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,080
Slow things down and help avoid accidents

659
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
Knocking balls adding steps

660
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,712
Options like they have right now

661
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,528
In favor of more clearly differentiated buttons

662
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
With you.

663
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
Different button sizes

664
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
Colors

665
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
All of the goal of making the

666
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,416
Test initiation

667
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,952
Easier and more obvious

668
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,232
When sending an actual alert

669
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
To already there fixing some of these issue

670
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,352
She was like creating a Panthers and out of Correction more quickly

671
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,144
From here on out a second step

672
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
Confirm again

673
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
Easy solutions

674
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
I think his Focus

675
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Too much

676
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,080
On human error

677
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
Retracting kneeler

678
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,640
After the fact

679
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176
Taking the design

680
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,504
It's totally true the process really

681
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
Amiri designer

682
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
From start to finish

683
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
And some of these changes

684
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,416
Are the words like having longer messages that also have emergency

685
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
Lynx

686
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
And numbers

687
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
Even though

688
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,536
They need to actually pass the system or offense

689
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
People are familiar with

690
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
Know how to react

691
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,912
During this accidental alert was discovered to

692
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
Number of emergency siren played

693
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,496
The wrong to Norge

694
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:34,848
Filled entirely filled both as a false alarm and as an actual

695
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:40,736
It's the rib Sunny ended up being a false alarm

696
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,040
But that still seems just unnecessary

697
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Westerly High

698
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,368
Yeah but I think we can all agree

699
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,136
That we need to Leo

700
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,464
Oh definitely that guy

701
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
I just hope

702
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
His name Never Comes

703
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
Me too

704
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
Alright thank you

Thanks
