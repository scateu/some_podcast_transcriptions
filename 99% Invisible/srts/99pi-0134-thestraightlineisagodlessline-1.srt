This is 99% invisible

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,288
Almost without fail an architectural Draft starts with one straight line

00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,568
Another

25
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,592
And another

26
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,176
Succession of clean orderly lines until eventually

27
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,968
A building emerges

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,320
And it makes sense that straight lines form the core of our built environment

29
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,904
The cost-efficient materials like wood and steel and pipes

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
Demonstrate linear units

31
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
LOL that's a bit of a tautology

32
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,864
But it's certainly easier to calculate structural loads on rectilinear surfaces

StraightLine dawnlod

So says producer Luisa back

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,128
Actually it's not my argument

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
It's disguise

00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
He was fully clothed

59
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,408
She looked out into a room full of Art Attack

60
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
And told them they were criminals

61
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,832
Planning lifeless rigid structures that restricted human creativity

62
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:11,488
The time has come for people to defend against it from find my Uber chemical structures like is enough

How to speak

He made one building in the US

95
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,703
A winery in Napa Valley

96
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,055
Is architecture is festooned with golden orbs in onion domes

97
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
Zigzagging tiles

Trees that grow out of apartment Window

99
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,711
Dreamed of creating indoor Moss

Mini architectural circles dismiss Hunter Vasquez work as catch

105
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,863
They look like buildings from dr. Seuss or Pee-wee's Playhouse or any number of children's cartoons

106
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,935
I actually got them built

107
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,495
And to him they weren't ischemic

108
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
Real

109
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
People live in his belt

110
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,663
Just trying to reframe what the built environment can be

111
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,223
To reimagine what architecture is

112
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Supposed to do

113
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
Today architect

114
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,391

The city where I was born

00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,119
MacBook is in what used to be communist East Germany

120
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,727
And it's one of those cities full of endless grids and straight line

121
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
It's rows and rows of

122
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,127
Gray's soviet-style apartment blocks in postwar Arkansas

123
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,919
Until

124
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,991
You walk onto the Main Street in the city centre

125
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Unaccounted

126
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Huge

127
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
8 story tall

128
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
Castle

129
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,415
In this Castle is bright bright pink

130
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
Salmon pink

131
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,511
And it's decorated with brown tile

132
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Squiggles

133
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,351
Like big ceramic Vines creeping up the

134
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Pinkwall

135
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,471
They're almost 900 Windows of all different shapes and sizes

136
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,567
And 150 different lollipop looking columns

137
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
Hold up the building

138
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
Dance floors

139
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
On the roof

140
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,967
Eight golden spheres rise triumphant

141
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,551
Like sons of the doll homogeneous block

142
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Around them

143
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,927
Parts of the roof slope all the way down to the street and it's covered in trees

144
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
This is why even though

145
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
The building is mostly pink

146
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
It's called the green Citadel

147
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
President of monster bull crap

148
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,679
With what to make of this gigantic

149
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Treetop

150
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
Salmon pink

151
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Castle

152
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,055
Everyone has different opinions about it

153
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
Including my grandpa

154
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
Who live about a 20 minute walk

155
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Jack from the Beanstalk

156
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
$2 in my pocket

157
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,015
I talked to them about it the last time I went back to his

158
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
And I understand.

159
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,999
My grandpa says he thinks it looks like a monkey

160
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,559
Things you don't see nothing hours

161
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
I asked him why

162
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,167
Any grants about the colorful facade and wavy surface

163
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,983
It just doesn't fit Adam you're the fattest

164
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
At my grandma she likes

165
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
In fact

166
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
She like to live in

167
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Ebates

168
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
The same as I do

169
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
It's so typical

170
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Instrumental

171
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,319
What does my grandmother describes it

172
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Quotes

173
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:25,439
The 40 communist years we lived in the same concrete high-rise

174
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,535
And here is an apartment building that represents the unique

175
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Each president

176
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
And who never realized

177
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
In my opinion she says

178
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
It should be more buildings like

179
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,007
Too bad he passed away

180
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:45,919
Plants of the green Citadel began in 1996 after the fall of the Berlin Wall

181
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,015
Hunter Vassar died in 2000 while at Sea on the QE2

182
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:55,135
The green Citadel was completed five years later percent of the green Citadel

183
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Covered in grass

184
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,975
In the building has 100 PSI called

00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
Free tenant

186
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,559
Trees that were planted into

187
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,375
Special rooms inside of people's apartment

188
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,727
And his ideas about how to incorporate Flora into buildings

189
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
Didn't stop

190
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
With plants and trees

191
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,871
When did father was also really into mold

192
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,455
Like the kind of mold that grows in the back of the fridge

193
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
Animal

194
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
Exhibits unusual characters

195
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,671
David moss grows over to give it the changes

196
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Open house

197
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,511
Together with mushrooms and vegetation

198
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,815
Life moves into a dollhouse

199
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:39,679
And it's delightful at Hunter Bowser's warped and kaleidoscopic buildings are

200
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,983
The exaltation of mold

201
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,543
Is where he and I part ways

202
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
At least we know we didn't suffer from allergies

203
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,455
Instead of TV is it better to watch nature Grovyle

204
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,783
And grow out of human control

205
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
For instance in the case of

206
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
Spontaneous

207
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,975
Oh boy was big on manifestos

208
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
He had another one that he called

209
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
And I am not making this up

210
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
The holy manifest

211
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
Every time but use the flush toilet

212
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,239
Rethink it isn't hygienic accomplishments

213
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
Button factory violet

214
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
The laws of nature

215
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,687
We pray before we eat in Boise Grace afterwards

216
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,015
But we do not pray Vanquish

217
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,879
Everything taking humans away from nature or any of our

218
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
Natural processes

219
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,487
Was an affront to Hunter Vassar

220
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,863
So his buildings were designed to keep us more in touch with our disgusting organic reality

221
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,935
If we do not treasure hours

222
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,751
And if we do not transform it into hummus

223
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,871
In honor of Cottontail belt will lose all right to be present on this Earth

224
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,455
Hummus is the part of the soil that's rich and dark with organic matter

225
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
Moon opposite had proposed

226
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,879
To plan natural urine purification systems and compost toilets in his building

227
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:09,535
Although his investors wouldn't back indoor compost toilets in the green Citadel when Louisa was last in Germany

228
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
She talked her way into the building

229
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
Is it the shower that he put in

230
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
For the bathroom they use

231
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Is blue tiles as a rim

232
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
And also knows

233
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
There's no straight line

234
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
None

235
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,383
I visited a bathroom in the green

236
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
Citadel

237
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
I didn't see any composting toilet

238
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
I didn't even see anymore

239
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
What I did see though

240
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
We're crazy pattern

241
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
Do you have

242
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,487
Round corners all over the apartment there are no

243
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Sharp and crisp

244
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Furniture

245
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,119
Nicole Zendaya and her Partner's apus

246
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,423
Austin live in the green Citadel

247
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
Set with two bathroom

248
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
First one with the top and one with the

249
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
Just a shower

250
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
The bathroom tiles are

251
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
Staggered and slightly shift

252
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
It's sideways

253
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,687
So that they don't line up and call them

254
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,015
In some places there tells a diagonal

255
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:07,135
A shattered and their fragments put back together to form a unique mosaic-like pattern

256
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
They showed me around their play

257
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
Are you see this is a different kind of window

258
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,279
It opens up all the way in

259
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
I got that

260
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
Round on top of it

261
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,935
Now we'll get into the parts of Hunter vossers Manifesto Bladen worldview that is

262
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,007
Blissfully free of mold and excrement

263
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,823
And appeals to our sense of individuality

264
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,639
Set the goal was to construct

265
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Creative life

266
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
Style for the people who live

267
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
And worked in and around

268
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
The green Citadel

269
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,087
He designed the building to encourage residence

270
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,391
Individuality to shine Ford

271
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719
And it wasn't just in terms of how we build

272
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,303
Part of it with the rules that governed

273
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,911
Apartment house tenant must have the freedom

274
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,959
Julion Alvarez

275
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:58,335
And as far as his hand raised to change the outside walls of his feelings

276
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,919
When is the second curridge residents to lean out of the window

277
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:06,015
And paint the facade around them any Colour and design they want

278
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
He called this concept

279
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Ben Stein

280
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Play Store

281
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
Right of window

282
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
Chainsaw Transformer is outside his searching as far as his arm

283
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:23,167
So that from 584 Bay Street everyone can see the eclipse in Miami

284
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
Who distinguishes himself

285
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
From his neighbor

286
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Then

287
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
The other place

288
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,639
When he says prisoners he's referring to you and me

289
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
Betty White

290
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,223
Clothes are your second skin your home is your third

291
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:41,855
If we choose our own clothes why shouldn't renters choose the colors for the outside walls

292
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
At least around the window

293
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,231
Hunter monster believe that residents painting their Windows their homes

294
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,047
Would be a form of Their Own self-expression

295
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:55,423
He wasn't explicitly demanding that residents clean out their windows and paint the borders around them

296
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,727
But he was hoping to design and environment

297
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,799
I would encourage them to do it of their own free will

298
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,199
I asked Sebastian and Nicole the green Citadel residents if they thought about taking them up on his right of window idea

299
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,783
We didn't but technically the righteous there

300
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,343
A trip hanging out the 4th floor

301
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,183
Of your window to try to change something I'm not going to do that

302
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
I'm having a hard time cleaning the windows

303
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,351
So far only one person has taken hold of us up on the right of window here

304
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
And the modifications were pretty minor

305
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
And now residents need to apply to claim their fence to ride the building manager told me that he hasn't received a c

306
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:38,431
Single application from anyone else requesting to paint the exterior facade around their window

307
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
To exercise their fence.

308
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,391
We took a quick pull here in the office and both Sam and I would be a little too intimidated to haphazardly paint the out

309
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,463
Outside of our window on an already amazing building

310
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,279
Avery would be leaning outside to paint on day one

311
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:58,399
And Katie would be out there on a window washers rig painting up a storm in a hot minute

312
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,543
I definitely love the right window idea even if I wouldn't necessarily participate

313
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
But it also feels a little like

314
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
Forest fun

315
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,039
Like being required to take a day off of work to play wacky games their co-workers and a company retreat

316
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,367
Or audience participation that stick

317
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
Dinner theater

318
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,231
We're having a pop album appear automatically on your phone

319
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,351
It's mainly fun for people designing the experience

320
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
Stop the irony in all of this

321
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
When did Father fought against architectural Doctrine

322
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,519
So that people could be free to

323
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
To express themselves

324
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Loneliest

325
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
She wanted them to

326
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,943
In many ways in addition to being brilliant objects of Art

327
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
Underbosses buildings were like concept car

328
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
High fashion

329
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,855
Three wheeled car with a bubble roof for

330
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,439
6ft tall fur hats are not meant for the mass Market

331
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,023
The radical concept smooth Norm forward

332
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,583
You certainly do not want house for the mall

333
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
You really don't it's terrible

334
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,447
But just try to find an urban s these days

335
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
Who is not all for green roofs

336
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,871
And that's what the big talking naked speech-giving Manifesto Riders of the world

337
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
R4

338
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
99% invisible with Bruce's sweet by Louisa back with Avery trufelman Sam Greenspan Katie mango

339
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
Go and me Roman Mars

340
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:48,735
We are project of 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco and produced in beautiful down

341
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,807
Downtown Oakland California out of the offices of arcsin

342
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,391
We check in with on so many of our stories

343
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,999
I think as a reaction to Eastern European Soviet Bloc style architecture

344
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
It makes a lot of sense

345
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,095
Well I want to see this become the norm probably not but

346
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
I think it's always healthy to have a variety of things

347
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
This is about

348
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
A city who has the

349
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,823
The foresight to say yeah these are pieces as architecture

350
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Are important

351
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:21,759
I shudder to think at the number of little mistakes we would make if we didn't have Adam and Daniel in the whole crew dark sign

352
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
It's right next to us to answer our questions

353
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Thanks for being there guys

354
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
Between the beats

355
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,791
Bongs and chatter of our devices

356
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,375
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

357
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
If

358
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:43,007
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

359
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:48,895
Talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remedy for all hearing that voice

360
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
Technology talk to us

361
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
It is a creation of Sonic trash

362
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,807
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

363
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,391
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

364
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
To make them more human

365
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
Turn the living room lights on

366
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Okay

367
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
Dim the living room lights to 50

368
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
2%

369
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
