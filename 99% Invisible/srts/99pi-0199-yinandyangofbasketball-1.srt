125 years ago

45
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,992
We tried everything to keep them quiet

46
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Something had to be done

47
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
One day I had an idea

48
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
Call the boys to the gym

49
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,256
Divided them up into teams of nine and gave him a new soccer ball

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
I showed them to Peach basket side nailed up at each end of the gym

51
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,960
I told them the idea

52
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
Into the opposing team speech path

53
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,104
Eleven Sports don't have such a definitive

54
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
But this one.

55
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
I blew a whistle

56
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
The first game of basketball begin

57
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,320
That day in 1891 James Naismith

58
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Invented basketball

59
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,440
And what role did you have for your new game

60
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Dr. Naismith

61
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
Well I didn't have enough

62
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
That's where I made my big mistake

63
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
The boys began text

64
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Kicking it

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
Punching in the country

66
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,728
They ended up in a free-for-all in the middle of the gym floor

67
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,336
In subsequent weeks Naismith would go on to make more rules for the game

68
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,712
Some of those are still around today like the one that says players can't run while holding the ball

69
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
They have to dribble a

70
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,368
Rule but it design decision that he made back in 1891

71
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,440
That continues to define the way the game is played

72
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
He had to decide how high

73
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
To hang the peach basket

74
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
That's Cari Champion she's an anchor at ESPN and host of the be honest podcast and she's going to help us tell

75
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:24,800
Story today Naismith chose to hang the peach basket at 10 feet above the porch floor

76
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:30,432
There was a running track that went around the court at that level but otherwise the decision was pretty random

77
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
And just a little higher or a little lower

78
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
And everything would be different

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
That arbitrary decision

80
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,928
To put the basket at 10 ft

81
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,024
Cause the game of basketball to take shape around the tallest players

82
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,816
But it happened gradually

83
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,912
In fact in the beginning the game was played by shorter less imposing players

84
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
In the very early days of the game

85
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,264
People didn't really have a conception of

86
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
Height having really

87
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Any importance

88
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
Mets writer and journalist Andrew High School

89
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
It's a lot of the other hiscores

90
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
Very early days guys were like six foot tall

91
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
It was not until

92
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
A few decades in

93
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
That

94
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
Team started recruiting

95
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
Really tall guy

96
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
Send at the time they were sort of

97
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
Refer to often is goon

98
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,768
Nowadays if you play a little rough or dirty you might be called a goon

99
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,119
Back then big men were sometimes called goons just because they were big

100
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,775
The first so-called going to have a major impact on the game was a big white dude named George Mikan who played for the mini

101
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Fabolous Lakers

102
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,103
From 1948 to 1956

103
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,967
He was a 6-foot 10 monster who wore big round spectacles when he played

104
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,367
Notice the comparative size of referee Ackman

105
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
Mike and towered over his opponents

106
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,767
Ambrose scoring records with his strength and accuracy

107
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:04,895
Mike and with such a force they actually had to change some rules in the game to offset his advantage

108
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,479
For example the rule against goaltending came about because it might

109
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:14,879
Goaltending is the active catching or batting away another player shot as the ball is on a downward passport

110
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Basket

111
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:20,767
Mike and was so tall he could just stand under the basket and SWAT away Shots by the other team

112
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
Goaltending was banned in 1945

113
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:29,983
But rule changes didn't stop George Mikan or his fellow big man from dominating defensively and offensive

114
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:35,103
You start to sing people saying like it's too easy to score like they actually were really sort of disgusting

115
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
They thought this should be a Triumph

116
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,943
To get the ball in the hoop not something that happen

117
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
170

118
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:46,623
The ease with which these super-tall players could put the ball in the basket was alarming people

119
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,695
The traditionalist didn't like the way the game was going

120
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,743
But they had no idea

121
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
What was about to hit them

122
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Bad dog

123
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Sometimes called the slam dunk

124
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
The first one in organized game happened in 1936 but donkey didn't really get going in basketball

125
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
Until the 1960s

126
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,247
Amanda traditional is

127
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
They hated the duck

128
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,879
But not just because it was a new unconventional way to put the ball in the basket

129
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
The dump became political

130
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
The chi year

131
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,511
Is 1966

132
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
That's Matt Andrew

133
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:32,191
My name is Matt Andrews I teach American history of UNC Chapel Hill and I have a particular Focus

134
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,239
Champs Sport and Society

135
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,543
So it was in 1966

136
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
In the NCAA champ

137
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Texas west

138
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
With an all-black starting five

139
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
Easily defeat Adolph Rupp

140
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
All white

141
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,159
This win by Texas Western against Kentucky was a big deal in the college basketball world

142
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,743
Kentucky was one of the last major college teams in the country

143
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,047
It still didn't have any black players

144
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,863
The coach of Kentucky for the guy named Adolph Rupp

145
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
Mini

146
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
Butte him as a racist

147
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,775
According to the sports correspondent Frank Deford who is in the Kentucky locker room that night

148
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,359
The language rap use against the Texas Western players

149
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,663
Send a chill down his spine

150
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,943
And there was this moment

151
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
Right at the beginning of the game

152
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
Where Texas Western David Lattin gets the ball

153
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
And makes a move toward the hoop

154
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,903
The defender in front of him is Pat Riley

155
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,999
He going to win nine NBA titles as a player coach and executive

156
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
In Latin

157
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Flies over him

158
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
While he's like six foot for stockli belt

159
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
In Latin just

160
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,959
Rises above him and slams The Ball

161
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,175
Texas's Victory and Latins dunk were seen as Direct

162
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
Challenges to the establishment

163
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,783
After all this was 1966

164
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,831
There was a lot going on in America

165
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,391
Black Panthers have become invisible force

166
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:01,279
In Oakland the Panthers had armed and organized themselves to protect their communities from brutal racist police

167
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:05,375
How many white Americans were worried a Revolution was about to take place

168
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
Black Power

169
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
Was this new evocative free

170
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,055
So that the failure to pass the Civil Rights bill

171
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
Racism because of black power

172
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,151
Isn't because of the students

173
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,479
What's so interesting about this phrase is it's

174
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,319
Lack of specificity no one is exactly sure what black power

175
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
Adidas contact

176
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:31,743
Comes the duck and it seems to be black power manifest on the basketball court

177
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
The dunk

178
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
Is

179
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
Physical

180
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
Donk is

181
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,727
Forceful you know when you lay the ball in your laying the ball in but when you dunk

182
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,263
You're doing it too

183
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,847
Someone and at a time when so many white Americans

184
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
AR

185
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,431
Uneasy with the Specter of black

186
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
Violence

187
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
The dunk

188
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Becomes

189
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
Suspect

190
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:00,927
Been to scare people like a tall frap even more comes a player called Lew Alcindor

191
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,327
You later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and become one of the most exciting and famous players in the history of the game

192
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,655
But in 1967 he was a young man

193
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
7 feet 2 inches tall

194
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,311
And already tearing up the college game with his vicious dunks in fast movement

195
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,127
Alcindor surrounded by white shirt

196
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
Unstoppable

197
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
So the NCAA

198
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:31,135
Betsy National Collegiate Athletic Association made a decision the only way to stop this guy with to get rid of the thing

199
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
Being heated best

200
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
The slam dunk

201
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
In 1967

202
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,279
They banned the dunk

203
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
And for 10 years

204
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
There's no dunking in college basketball

205
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,983
Lew Alcindor AKA Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who's not happy about this

206
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,639
In fact he explicitly said that the only reason for the band was because they were scared that black guys like him we're going to take over the

207
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,199
The game although he was much stronger words

208
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
Regardless

209
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
The slam dunk was done

210
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,087
In college basketball was sent back in time for 10 years

211
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,159
Basketball was in a bad place

212
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:10,047
The NCAA administrators had made an arguably racist decision to ban the slam dunk

213
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,607
Meanwhile in the professional League the NBA

214
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,679
Players can still dunk but fans were losing interest

215
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
Here's Andrew heysel again

216
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
This is

217
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
For the NBA

218
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
Considered like V

219
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Low point

220
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Of the week

221
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,919
They're all of these pieces written about how

222
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,991
The game is dying and nobody wants to watch in this all these

223
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
Questions about why

224
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,087
Naismith original accidental design decision

225
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
To put the basket at 10:50

226
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,231
I didn't Berkeley given us this beautiful and exciting slam dunk

227
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,119
But it also caused the professional game to revolve too much around these super tall players

228
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,703
The game just got jammed up around the net

229
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
People weren't passing as much

230
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,591
They just hand the ball to the giant guy and he'd stand under the basket

231
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
Trying to put it in

232
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
This had the effect of slowing down the play

233
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:03,551
And that slowness was draining the game of its excitement basketball

234
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,367
People suggested a lot of fixing

235
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
No backbone

236
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
Contacts backup

237
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,975
A smaller basket a bigger ball

238
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,047
A smaller ball I know scoring Zone around the basket

239
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
And even a hike app

240
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,167
Another group of coaches called for the hoop to be raised to 12 ft

241
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
None of those changes caught on

242
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
And then

243
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
This guy comes along

244
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,871
We feel that those people who are not

245
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
Under contractual

246
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
Navigation to

247
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,551
To remember George Mike the original NBA goon 6 foot 10 inches tall

248
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
Big round specs

249
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:41,951
Will a 1967 he was working as a travel agent in Minnesota or used to play

250
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:47,583
When you get a call from a couple of guys asking if you want to head up a new professional basketball league that would compete

251
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
With the NBA

252
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,447
What was old NBA friends have to say about his new job

253
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
Good luck

254
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,639
I mean it really was just started making up that you go on

255
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
It was

256
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
Simply what

257
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
Get an idea

258
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
And let's see what we can do here

259
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,855
That's Terry Pluto who wrote a book about the founding of this new league

260
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,647
They called it the Ada

261
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,951
The American Basketball Association

262
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,511
And George Mikan became its first commissioner

263
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,095
They were trying everything to get fans we engaged in a game

264
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,679
Sometimes they featured Cow Milking contest for entertainment

265
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,727
And1 half time show in Indiana

266
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,031
About the wrestling bear called Victor

267
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,847
Beautiful Brown

268
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
There looks to be

269
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
That he weighs at least five

270
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,015
Most of their ideas didn't stack

271
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,855
A lot of times good ideas are like that they're one of 12 things at

272
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
People suck

273
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,207
To the wall in and out of the 12-1 became really good

274
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,023
One helped a little bit and the other 10 are almost embarrassing

275
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,839
In this case one of the ideas was really good

276
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,679
In fact it's the design solution that arguably saved basketball

277
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,007
In the secret star of the story that were telling right now

278
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
The three

279
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Point

280
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
Shot

281
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
So all you Sports

282
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
Smithfield we're all worth 2 points

283
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,023
But the aviators Innovation which they actually borrowed from an earlier defunct we

284
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,071
We should draw an arch line

285
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,375
About 22 feet away from the basket

286
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
In any shot made from behind that line

287
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Was now worth

288
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Three points

289
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
The ABA was trying to please the fan

290
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,103
Fans get excited when they see a 3-pointer

291
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,663
But they can also go and practice the shot at home

292
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,063
It's more egalitarian that's Ramona Shelburne senior writer for espn.com

293
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
If I practice hard enough

294
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
Don't have to be the most athletic guy in the car

295
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
I don't have to be

296
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,535
An incredible dunker it's it's something that when fans watch it they think I can do that too

297
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,191
In 1976 the NBA merged with the ABA and three years later they brought in

298
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
At first it was about pleasing the fan

299
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,079
But they slowly came to realize something about the three-point shot

300
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
When you study if you shoot

301
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
35% on 3-pointers

302
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
And you shoot

303
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
45% on 2 point

304
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Just break it down

305
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831
It makes so much more sense to

306
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,879
Build a team around 3-point shooting because

307
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,183
You're going to score more points and that's them

308
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Point of the game

309
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,023
And now some teams have decided that the way to win

310
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
Is to concentrate

311
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
On three point shot

312
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,143
When NBA first introduce the 3-point shot

313
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
Games featured

314
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
Only a couple of 3-point attempts

315
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
This season

316
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,311
It's more than 10 times bad

317
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,663
And if there's any team that's demonstrating the value of the 3 point shot right now

318
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,223
It's the Golden State Warriors from California

319
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
And Mister Steph Curry

320
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Hurry

321
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:07,775
You don't know who Steph Curry as he's about six foot three so he's short by NBA standards but this hasn't stopped him from being the

322
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,103
Star of the team end of the whole NBA

323
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,431
I think every kid growing up an American I was trying to be Steph Curry

324
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
He is

325
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
Skinny and

326
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,575
Doesn't seem to have anything physically dominant about him

327
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,879
And yet when you watch him play He's Alive

328
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,695
Curry can hit 3-pointers for Golden State

329
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
From really anywhere he likes which makes it hard to defend against them and balances the influence of the big men

330
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,655
Because of their guys like her who can score from

331
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Anywhere

332
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,495
Then the 7-foot guys have to move away from the basket

333
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
Weather most useful

334
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Could have been

335
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,199
And once you allow players to score an extra point from shooting further out the game spreads out

336
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
You got a whole new game

337
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,295
The game has changed for the better

338
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
Is no doubt about it

339
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
That's former Indiana Pacer Jerry Harkness

340
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,463
Harkness was a player in the NBA and the ABA

341
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,255
Because the game is exciting

342
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
The game

343
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
Is running shoe

344
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Quickness

345
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
Defense

346
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
Opening the game up

347
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
Making it more grass

348
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:12,799
But even though the 3-point shot has had a balancing influence some traditionalists

349
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
Still don't like it

350
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,151
Penile leakage basketball

351
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,247
And like a circus sort of thing you know when we have a 5 point shot

352
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
7 point shot

353
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183
Stop doing that sort of thing. Just old school that San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich

354
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,535
Speaking to ESPN about Steph Curry's Golden State Warriors last year

355
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,887
What Popovich is saying kind of Echoes what people said about the dump 50 years ago

356
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
That it's a trick

357
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,215
A departure from the fundamentals of basketball

358
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
And I kind of agree with Coach pop

359
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,591
But even Popovich seems to think that the 3-point shot is here to stay

360
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:52,735
Do certain degree you better embrace it you going to lose and every time we want to Championship 3-point shot was a big part of it

361
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,855
Instead of Designing the beautiful powerful dunk out of the game we designed a counterbalance

362
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
The 3 point shot

363
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,951
And now the game is more inclusive than it's ever been

364
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,047
You got these little guys I can shoot bombs from anywhere on the court

365
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
And there's still room for the big guys close in

366
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,191
The three pointer and the dunk and become the yin and yang

367
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
A basketball

368
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263

369

The 10-foot tall basket to dunk

370
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
The 3 point shot

371
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
But then again the game wasn't

372
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
Carefully designed in the first place

373
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,783
Really it came about because all James Naismith wanted

374
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,087

379
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,351
