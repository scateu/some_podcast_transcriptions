Every house is haunted

This is 99% invisible

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,936
Future of Architecture is the

25
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,472
The future of the human race

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
Jordan 1

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,312
It's a matter that has a future

28
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
It is

29
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Architecture

30
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
Betty's architect Frank Lloyd Wright

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,808
Who never shied away from making Grand statements about

32
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
Or himself

33
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:34,976
And I've been accused of saying I was the greatest architect in the world and if I had said so

34
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,024
I don't think it would be very

35
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
Aragon

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,680
Ray believe that the buildings we live in affect the kind of people we become

37
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
Hey sweetheart

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,496
The Comfort we seek

39
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,592
He said that he could rebuild the entire culture of the United States

40
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,896
He claimed that he could change the nation

41
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
By changing its architecture

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,224
I didn't say that

43
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
And it's true

44
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,600
Amazing but I could do for this country

45
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
And a big part of his

46
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
Plan

47
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
Is philosophy

48
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Proposed building system

49
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Was called

50
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,536
Usonia

51
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
Mets reporter Avery truffelman

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
If you're like you Sonia what's that

53
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,448
Listen to part 1 of the story that's the last episode of the show

54
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,288
This is part 2 and I'll make a lot more sense after part 1

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
But to summarize

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
Usonian homes were simple but beautiful custom homes design to exist in harmony with a

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,016
Natural landscape around them

58
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,672
Wright had hoped to make these homes inexpensive enough to be affordable for middle and working-class Americans

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,512
The first usonian home cost $5,500

60
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,304
About 85 Grand today

61
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,192
Right built it for journalist Herbert Jacobs and his wife Catherine in Madison Wisconsin in 1937

62
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
And many would come after it

63
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,800
No none managed to be as expensive as the first one

64
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
But there are usonian houses in Alabama California Illinois Massachusetts Virginia Pennsylvania and

65
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,808
Beyond

66
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,048
Nowadays usonian houses maybe seen the Countrywide

67
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,632
You'll know when you see one

68
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,168
Long low

69
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
Parts of the very Earth

70
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,520
You can practically hear the house posting

71
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright

72
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,664
But that old timey announcer actually doesn't have a quite right

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
They're not all designed by Frank Lloyd Wright

74
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Towards the end of his life

75
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,064
Brightwood become preoccupied with a large Commission

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,856
Things like the Marin Civic Center

77
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
Guggenheim

78
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
He would have less time to focus

79
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
Guess I'm his vision

80
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
Are you Sonia

81
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
But rights ideas

82
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:49,120
About living in harmony with nature using organic materials in a modern way

83
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
And creating a fordable

84
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
Democratic housing

85
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,752
Had inspired a new generation of Architects

86
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
So much so

87
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,616
That they would go on to found an entire community

88
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
Based on writing and principles

89
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
Turn right on usonia Road

90
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
Nestled in leafy Hills near Pleasantville New York

91
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
About an hour north of Manhattan

92
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
The little village called usonia

93
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,232
All the homes have low flat roofs

94
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
They're tucked away into the trees

95
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,095
So you can hardly see them on our summer days

96
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
It almost looks like some sort of Star Wars planets

97
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,703
Fit for Suburban Ewok

98
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
There's no big welcome sign

99
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
The gift shop for lease

100
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
In the middle of a community

101
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
There is a black

102
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
Usonia homes

103
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,295
Is a Cooperative was founded in 1944 by idealistic young families to pursue the dream of owning a modern affordable

104
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
Go home in the country following World War II

105
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:47,231
The Cooperative was started by a couple of right disciples when studied at Frank Lloyd Wright School Taliesin

106
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,279
Most notably a man named David hanke

107
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
And although right would be involved with the project

108
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
It was hankin who guided it

109
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
As the black says

110
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,727
This land was acquired in December 1946

111
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
An April 1947 Frank Lloyd Wright

112
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
Supervising architect

113
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
Something unique site plan

114
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,455
Beside plan put 40 some houses on circular properties

115
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
Without fence

116
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
So that the property boundaries would flow into each other

117
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,135
Homes wouldn't be on little square plots with white picket fences

118
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
David Hinton and his family look for other similarly minded people who could come and join their community in investing in

119
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
Among those idealistic young people

120
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
Was Roland rides

121
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
He and his wife had just been married in 1950

122
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,055
We had no money we had no children we were both only children

123
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
We wanted to

124
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,151
Play Darude Sandstorm a family

125
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
And we heard

126
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
From a friend

127
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
That does a

128
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
Community in Northern Westchester

129
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Let's

130
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,623
Building affordable homes supervised by Frank Lloyd Wright

131
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,183
This building project had a communal mortgage

132
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
They would pay for the houses together

133
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,559
On land they all owned for cooperative

134
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
Let's take a look

135
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
Curious

136
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
I wake him up here

137
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
And they were already

138
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
Henry 11 homes that were

139
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,871
Nearest nearing completion or beginning to be occupied we were welcomed with open arms and the enthusiasm of the people

140
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
We're here and talking about their project

141
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
Was infectious and we were we were hooked

142
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
We decided that will join the community

143
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,599
But it wasn't all a big romantic adventure

144
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
It was a real risk

145
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
First of all first with redis

146
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,279
Nothing these days it's called mid-century modern

147
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
But the architecture then was red

148
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,727
Meaning these homes were so strange looking to the larger world that the people who chose to live in them where

149
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Seen as radical

150
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,055
And in some ways they were

151
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
Some of them were Lefty Jews from the Bronx

152
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,663
Socialist ideals about land ownership

153
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,223
The true cooperatives that we were

154
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
Was Radical

155
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,599
Operators in the sense that no one owns their house

156
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
Yes

157
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
Also this was a Financial Risk

158
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,975
Since the houses were not as cheap as they were supposed to be

159
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,791
They supposed $5,000 cost

160
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
What time that it was not a realistic number

161
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,703
During and after World War materials and labor became more

162
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Expensive

163
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
In the building of usonian homes involved

164
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
Special skills

165
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,663
Custom fixtures and the house has ended up being double or triple their price estimates

166
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,479
The Riley's house was over twenty Grand

167
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
But the members of usonia

168
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,391
Would not be deterred we were determined to go forward with this we were all very optimistic

169
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,231
Pill with occasionally to see these house under construction

170
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,279
You got to come and see you in the same to you

171
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
When Rowland and his wife signed up for the community

172
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,727
They thought they'd work with one of the Taliesin graduates to design their house

173
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
Not the master himself

174
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,591
We didn't dream of a project Frank Lloyd Wright's I mean really

175
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,175
Who who is 31st

176
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,015
But Frank Lloyd Wright did in fact want to design Rowlands

177
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
They met up in New York

178
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
And they exchanged letters and ideas about the

179
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,671
Roland went out to see right at Taliesin

180
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:02,559
Who is the real person you could talk to him you could exchange a joke I mean people people don't don't see him that way

181
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
But

182
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
There there was

183
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
Roland was 26

184
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
Wright was 83

185
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
Come on rolling sit down

186
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,543
You're my client I'm your architect

187
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,615
I'll redesign your house as many times as I have to

188
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,919
Until I was satisfied all of your needs

189
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
You have to speak up

190
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
But you don't you'll take what you get

191
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,623
Roland's house would be one of three and usonia New York that Frank Lloyd wright-designed himself

192
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,207
About five years after the rise Lee's moved in when rolling is wifey

193
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
A kids

194
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,535
Frank Lloyd Wright added an extension to their house

195
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
In fact

196
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,959
Roland is the last living owner of a Frank Lloyd Wright usonian home built specially

197
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
For him

198
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
And he still lives in it

199
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,311
I came to realize

200
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
After some years living here

201
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,223
It did not been a day in my life when I didn't see something beautiful

202
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,831
Even the terrible days that occur in every life

203
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,415
The house is completely usonian

204
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
With simple carport

205
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
Sumptuous wooden walls that almost

206
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,095
Glow and one big main room in a tiny kitchen

207
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:13,983
It almost feels like you're outside because it has these big glass windows with long roof overhang

208
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,567
Draw the eye out towards the thick forest of trees

209
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
Just outside I feel included his

210
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,919
Had an effect on me

211
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
In many many ways

212
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,295
The neuroscientist say that that kind of sense

213
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
Reduces stress and that is

214
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Good for you

215
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
Good for your love

216
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:36,511
And maybe good physical health to I'm 92 years old I'm pretty good shape for 9

217
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,071
Keto diet review that

218
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
Partly I mean

219
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Who knows

220
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
I'd like to attribute that

221
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
To the experience

222
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
Beauty around me

223
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
For most of my life

224
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
Which is quite remarkable

225
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
Is Roman season

226
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,991
Frank Lloyd Wright's idea that better architecture could create a better way of life

227
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:02,111
Has been entirely true we could depend on each other if there was a problem or a need

228
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
The kids will

229
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,463
Do all the all the adults by their first name

230
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,559
Used to say that children growing up here at 50 aunts and uncles and usonia

231
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,959
The first 40 Years of usonia New York only 12 of the 48 houses change pans six of those

232
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,263
Go to Next Generation members of the community

233
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
There are only two divorces

234
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,639
I have the joke I could pick and decide who get the house

235
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,247
But life started to move at different Paces for people living in usonia

236
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,319
Suddenly they weren't all new young families

237
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
Are all groups of people in different phases

238
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
With different needs

239
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,303
And when it was time for homes to change hands perspective buyers were thrown off by The Cooperative nature of the village

240
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,399
In the first Decades of usonia members didn't own their homes

241
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,447
We decided very reluctant

242
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
2

243
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,031
Grant title to the individual home sites

244
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
To each member

245
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
While retaining all of our

246
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Common land

247
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Azure co op

248
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,479
And that made a big difference that suddenly people

249
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Wellington

250
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,623
If you're not Roland reisley and your house Wasn't custom-built for You by Frank Lloyd Wright himself

251
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,695
Usonian houses can be a bit of an adjustment

252
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,279
Today most of the homes and usonia New York have been expanded

253
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,631
Any and all new additions have been built in a usonian style

254
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:22,239
Using local materials flat roofs big glass windows and radiant sensibilities

255
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
They have to be built that way

256
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,127
While the outsides are not Landmark they are governed by the board of usonia

257
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
The insides are not at all

258
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,503
This is Evan Kingsley he's one of the newcomers to usonia

259
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Relatively

260
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,647
He's been there since 2003 but I think for the most part those of us who have chosen to move here

261
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
Are really sensitive to the aesthetic of the

262
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Interior

263
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,327
But there's one specific part of the Interior that has changed in a lot

264
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Of the usonian homes

265
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
We've completely redone the kitchen

266
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,799
As was the case in most usonian homes the kitchen in Evans home was this little Alco

267
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
Very efficient and very

268
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
Mary Toney

269
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,223
Right never realize that the whole family might actually want to hang out in the kitchen

270
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,319
Nowadays it's as much a place to gather at the living room or the dining room

271
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,927
Evan is added new tiling and appliances and expanded his kitchen

272
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,583
But not by much closet space away and we gain I don't know maybe 10 in

273
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
Is there that's all that we gained

274
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
I'm doing that

275
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,263
There are a smattering of usonian homes throughout the United States

276
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,079
Some design by write-in some by his apprentices

277
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
But all following the same basic principles

278
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
And like Evan kingsley's home

279
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,015
Many of these other usonian houses are hard to modify

280
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,367
Because they're often governed by Boards were trying to preserve them as historic

281
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
Pieces of architecture

282
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
And also

283
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,999
Donors themselves want to make sure they keep within the principles of the house

284
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,047
You have X number of cabinets

285
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
You don't have cabinets

286
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Up at the top

287
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
They weren't

288
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
Put there in a few good atom

289
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Youku

290
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:04,127
Violate the principles

291
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
That's Betty and John Moore

292
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,295
They live in Wisconsin in the house called Jacob's to

293
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:15,647
It's the second usonian house that Wright designed for that journalist Herbert Jacobs

294
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,207
Yeah well you want to make sure that

295
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
You

296
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,071
Can adapt to the house because it's not going to reject teeth

297
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
You aren't going to

298
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Change it

299
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Much

300
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,471
Like most usonian homes Jacobs to add a carport

301
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Big windows

302
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
An open-plan

303
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
In concrete floors with a heating system

304
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,127
The floor is nice and cool nails

305
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
When are you come downstairs

306
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
Fairfield is nice and warm

307
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:44,831
I mostly wanted to play that clip because I love how Betty and John actually complete each other sentences

308
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
Betty and John's house needed a lot of attention

309
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,927
Which is why it was on the market

310
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
Four and a half years before they bought it

311
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
Everybody wanted to look at it

312
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,583
Is it curiosity but nobody wanted to live here

313
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,655
If they're really not for everyone

314
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,751
The reason they sit on the market sometimes for so long is because

315
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
People consider them

316
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
A difficult

317
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:11,455
Living pets John eifler an architect in Chicago who has restored a number of lighthouses

318
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,759
Including usonia 1

319
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
Reserve them

320
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
You sometimes have

321
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Modify

322
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
In order to make them more level

323
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,279
But even experts like eifler have a tough time keeping track of how many usonian homes exist

324
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
So how many are there

325
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,143
I don't know

326
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:34,495
I've heard numbers ranging from 27 to 140

327
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,103
It all depends on your definition of what an authentic usonian house is

328
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
You could consider usonia

329
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
.

330
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,199
Frank Lloyd Wright's life

331
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:48,063
Period in American architectural history which would include the houses by the apprentices

332
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,879
Or just a general architectural style

333
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
Depending on your definition

334
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,743
The number of usonian houses continues to grow

335
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,071
In 2013 a new usonian house was Bill

336
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
On the campus

337
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,375
Florida Southern College

338
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,191
It was a design of Rights from 1939

339
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,495
But constructed 74 years later

340
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
All according to Wright's plans

341
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:15,199
Usonia certainly never came to pass in the way that Frank Lloyd Wright originally envisioned

342
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
With every American living in an affordable

343
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
Custom home

344
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
In fact

345
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:24,671
Elements of the usonian home ever evolve into something else entirely

346
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:29,279
So it is kind of true the boat that usonia directly influence the development of the Rancho

347
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
Without a doubt

348
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
I think so

349
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:37,727
Ranch style houses are all over the country and nearly every suburb

350
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,543
They are horizontal close to the ground

351
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,823
One story

352
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
They have an open floor

353
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
With few walls

354
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
So it's not hard to see the similarities

355
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
G70

356
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,039
Ranch homes are generally less inspired

357
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:55,135
I don't have the elegant details and they're made with standard materials

358
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:01,023
Right might not have been pleased the concepts of usonia I got absorbed into

359
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,607
Essentially the epitome of cookie cutters Suburban housing

360
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,703
At least these houses really were affordable for the middle class

361
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
Unlike all the usonia

362
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
Houses after usonia 1

363
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
Every war

364
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,615
