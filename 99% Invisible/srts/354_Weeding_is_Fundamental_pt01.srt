1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,048
This is 99% invisible

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,328
I'm Roman Mars

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,448
There's a common complaint that people don't read book

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,984
But the truth is

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,032
Print book sales are up dates.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,616
Since 2013 sales of physical books have increased

7
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,640
Every year

8
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,968
The first people attributed to the rise of adult coloring books

9
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,528
But even as their popularity has dwindled

10
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,064
Book Sales have risen

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,344
I'm talking about

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,648
Physical old fashioned books

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,696
Paper Pages Boulevard

14
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,488
We love them

15
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,328
The great Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges once said

16
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,888
I cannot sleep unless I am surrounded by books

17
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,680
And I kind of agree

18
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,472
Best reporter Pierce County

19
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,264
Although he's not normal

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,032
Hoverboard

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,336
I'm a graduate student in creative writing

22
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:51,200
And for the past two years I taught fiction writing to undergrads at the University of Virginia

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:55,552
I assign a lot of reading but mostly it's in the form of photocopy pages

24
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,856
But don't worry The Print Shop pays for the rice

25
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't want to force my students to buy too much but I always make sure I assign at least one physical book

26
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,560
I always try to pick something that's beautiful

27
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:11,936
When was the nice font a lovely page design a pleasing paper grain an intriguing cover

28
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,752
Don't get me wrong the words inside matter too

29
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,592
But I think it's important for my students to have an object that accentuates

30
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,640
The pleasure of the physical act of reading

31
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,200
It's something that would hold onto after the class attendance

32
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:27,808
I personally caused hundreds of pages of radio scripts and recycling bin every month

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
But I would have a really hard time throwing away

34
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,696
What's the pages have a spine

35
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
It's like they have

36
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Seoul

37
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
It would feel wrong

38
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,840
Like you're spitting on knowledge itself

39
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
It's so hard

40
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
To get ready

41
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
Set up box

42
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,728
This is a story about books

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
And

44
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,776
Brace yourself

45
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
How to get rid of them

46
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,104
And in the words of REM

47
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
It starts with an earthquake

48
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,504
Just go in the background and we zoom into kilo stick

49
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
Fart

50
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,112
It was the most Bay Area sporting event imaginable

51
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,928
The Oakland A's were playing the San Francisco Giants

52
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,976
The 1989 World Series

53
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,072
Coming into the third game on October 17th 1989

54
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
The A's were in the lead

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,448
They won the first two games

56
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
And he fails to get Dave Parker

57
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,824
But just as the third game was about to kick-off

58
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,504
The TV broadcast cut out

59
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
When the signal came back

60
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
It was no longer a baseball

61
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:41,536
This is Cheryl Jennings on the channel 7 news room as you may have noticed our power was knocked out

62
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,840
Is the early minutes of the Loma Prieta earthquake

63
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
Race track near Santa Cruz

64
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:52,288
This was the first major earthquake ever to be broadcast live on national TV

65
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
An elevator in shelter

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,200
Part of the Bay Bridge has been destroyed their fires falling buildings widespread power outages

67
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:04,064
It all there were 63 deaths and almost 4000 injuries

68
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
But this is a story

69
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,696
About what happened to the San Francisco Public Library

70
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
After this earthquake

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,048
And because of this earthquake

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,168
The library suffered a lot of damage

73
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
Especially on the higher floors

74
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,520
So one of the things about an earthquake is

75
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,848
Daily effective it is intensified the higher up you go

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
On the upper levels of the library

77
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Fluorescent cave

78
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,016
Jason Gibbs was a new library in there but he couldn't go to work

79
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
For two months after the quake

80
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
It was too dangerous

81
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,440
He says bookshelves would collapse sideways or falling on their faces

82
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,488
And books lie in piles everywhere

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,304
Like the books have been tossed around by

84
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Some

85
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Angry Forest

86
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,424
No one was injured at the San Francisco Public Library

87
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
But the earthquake

88
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,264
Dumped half a million books on the floor

89
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
Even after 2 months of repairs

90
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,920
The post earthquake situation in the San Francisco Public Library was still pretty bad

91
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,736
Library management determines the stacks weren't safe

92
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,296
And designated a new room for public browser

93
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,880
Librarians curated a selection of books that they thought the public would most likely

94
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
And those books went in that room

95
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
But they realized along the way that

96
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
Not every book was going to

97
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,559
To fit in other words

98
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,911
Even this window down selection of books was too large for the available space

99
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
They need to win it down even more

100
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,287
Earthquake just happen we don't have this shelving anymore

101
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
We need to make space

102
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
That's

103
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,919
A reasonable thing to do if you approach it in a thoughtful way

104
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,991
Biggest libraries do get rid of books

105
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
All the time

106
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
Earthquake or not

107
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:45,951
Put simply there are so many new books coming in every day and only a finite amount of libraries face

108
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,047
Practice of freeing up library space is called

109
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
Wieting if you think about it if it sounds ugly but it is a really good description

110
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,287
Mikkeller she supervises teen services at the Oakland Public Library

111
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:04,127
Avery Chapman went down the street to visitor and see how she weed

112
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,503
You have to weed your garden for like the flowers to grow

113
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:16,159
Reading is not just about holding the book in your hands and ask yourself if that book spark Joy

114
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
Specific guidelines

115
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,279
We're not just randomly grabbing books at the shelf and putting them in the trash

116
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:26,911
Tell her in many other Librarians at libraries all over the world with ourselves using the same set of guidelines

117
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
Excellent acronym

118
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
M u s t y

119
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,079
Is for misleading

120
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:40,223
Are factually inaccurate a little broken

121
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
So beat up

122
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:46,367
Indication it would love for sure so

123
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
New copy of it

124
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,207
If it hasn't been checked out in the last 3 years I would probably consider

125
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
Esper superseded

126
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,071
Buy a new edition or much better book

127
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:59,935
This is like an old manual for Windows 98 or an outdated travel guide

128
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
These are the kinds of books to get shredded

129
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,823
The last two letters rt for trivial and why

130
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
Your collection has no use for this book

131
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,431
Because I really want that musty acronym to work

132
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,503
Does last to the T in the Y

133
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
Trivial and your library has no need for this book

134
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
These are the tricky ones

135
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,415
They're not necessarily statements of fact

136
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,951
Their judgments of value

137
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,047
What's trivial to me might be very important to you and vice versa

138
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,655
But even hear these judgment calls are made by Librarians who specialize in the relevant section

139
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Based on circulation

140
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,031
You just have to trust that you're Librarians are doing their best for the public

141
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
We want to be able to keep

142
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,359
Bringing you the most relevant

143
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,383
Most current

144
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,943
Information in the only way to do that is by having

145
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,759
To do it so the only way we can do that is by

146
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
Sometimes

147
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
Withdrawing the things that are not as though

148
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,183
Although some sections according to the library guidelines are

149
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
Generally self weeding

150
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
In other words

151
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
They disappear

152
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
How people feel

153
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,863
Certain sections of the library at 10 to disa

154
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
If you're more than other

155
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
Books about marijuana the Bible

156
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,263
They called are probably the biggest ones I can think of

157
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,567
But for the sections that do have to get weed

158
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,127
Weeding is generally a touchy subject

159
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,199
The reason why is probably already clear to you

160
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,783
People don't like the idea of books being thrown away

161
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
We like la

162
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
Perhaps no one loves books more

163
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
The librarian

164
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,583
There's a part of you that just winces every time you have to remove a book I need a legal books are dear to us

165
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,143
Hardy Weinberg sure has a librarian is

166
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
To get over that a little bit

167
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,751
Yes reading is normal and necessary

168
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,151
But after the 1989 earthquake the San Francisco Public Library started weeding and unusual

169
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Amount of books

170
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223
The Librarians were told to move quickly

171
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
And I didn't use musty

172
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
Or any sort of comprable system

173
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,463
The Librarians were ordered to go through each collection book by buck and insert a slip of paper into each

174
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
Green yellow and red

175
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,815
Green metal bucket been checked out that

176
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,399
Yellow metal bucket been checked out in the last 2 years

177
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,495
And red meant it had been over two years since somebody had checked out that

178
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
And the read books

179
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
We're the ones that were

180
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
In potential Danger

181
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
Danger because management had decided

182
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
At the Redbox

183
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
Had to go

184
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,807
Compared to the careful consideration of musty

185
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,367
The system of the green yellow and red card

186
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
Prices of rather blunt instruments

187
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
It's really not the only measure

188
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
Weather somebody is borrowed at

189
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Within the last

190
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Period of time

191
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
Felt rather arbitrary

192
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:40,191
And it wasn't really clear where the red card books were going to go or if they would ever be used again

193
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
And json gives us a

194
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
For example

195
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
The art and music collection

196
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,871
The discarded books got sent to an abandoned Hospital owned by the city

197
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
Because there was nowhere else to put them

198
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,735
Even battle-hardened Librarians like Gibbs

199
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,295
Stop the wedding was happening too fast

200
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,623
You had Librarians and different sections weeding furiously

201
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
And not really communicating with

202
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
Are the consequence

203
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Lots and lots of books

204
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
Swirl remover

205
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
From the library

206
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
And no one quite knew how many

207
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
Because no one was

208
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
Keeping track

209
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
It was

210
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,215
Ultimately I think a weakness of management from the top

211
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
Jason Gibbs is a pretty even-keeled guy

212
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
But that's a diplomatic way of saying that

213
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
The problems began with the

214
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
The head librarian

215
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
A man named

216
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
Kenneth Dowling

217
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,759
We're going to hear it to you could be visiting the public

218
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Library

219
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
Without leaving your home

220
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
Since this is the years leading up

221
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
The 1989 North

222
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:36,511
The San Francisco Public Library was starting to rethink its whole approach the books

223
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
The new little thing

224
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
Call the internet

225
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,447
Imagine plugging a computer like this one into any telephone in the world

226
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
And being able to search

227
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
Any library in the world

228
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,103
And a big part of this pivot was when in 1987

229
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,943
San Francisco hired Kenneth Dowling as its new city librarian

230
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,991
San Francisco city librarian

231
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:03,391
Kindling must make sure that two million people have access to 18 million books and other information on a limited

232
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
Stalin was all about the internet

233
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,047
Did recently published a book called the electronic library

234
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,887
In which he argued that technology was changing the way people use information

235
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
And therefore changing the role of librarian

236
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
This is a clip

237
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,031
Internet web world

238
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Uwell

239
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Collapses time

240
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Classes distance

241
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
And is clamped

242
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,759
If it sounds unremarkable not to mention a bit quaint

243
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
Keep in mind that Dowling

244
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
Wisin all this stuff

245
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,111
As early as 1984

246
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,927
He certainly understood at an early stage

247
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,743
What the internet was going to do for communication

248
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,863
But there was a flip side to dowling's Visionary concept of digitally net

249
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
Worth library

250
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,727
Some people felt that Dowlen had a distressing lack of concern

251
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Starbucks

252
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
There was a sense that

253
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
When it came to the

254
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
Physical collections he didn't

255
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
You just didn't have any interest

256
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,271
Dowling was also overseeing the design of a new main library for the city of Sanford

257
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Francisco

258
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
Which would complete his vision of the library of the future

259
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:11,999
The city is building a new 100 million dollar library that is wired for computers as well as television

260
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
This new library would have

261
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,071
Twice as much space as the old one

262
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,143
But a big chunk of that face wasn't going to be for shelving books

263
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Instead

264
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,239
Much of the library's interior was devoted to an atrium

265
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
In the middle of the building

266
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,847
We should rise 86ft to a conical glass roof

267
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,711
Lots of librarians worried that this big empty Atrium wouldn't leave a lot of space

268
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
4 books

269
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:37,599
The Atrium was evidence that books were not the sole priority of this building

270
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,183
And darling wasn't going to let a good crisis go to waste

271
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,023
Earthquake was a perfect excuse to do what he wanted to do anyway

272
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,119
Shrink the physical collection before the move to the new space

273
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,215
Gallons Administration started sending books to landfills

274
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,007
In the days after the quake

275
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,055
Books are being sent out by the truckload

276
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
Several times a week

277
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,895
This is not normal Library practice

278
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
27 librarian

279
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
Sign a petition

280
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,527
Asking Kenneth Dowling for the weeding to stop

281
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
But that didn't work

282
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
To Jason Gibbs and his colleagues

283
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
Decided to do something

284
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,951
In any institution you have a variety of

285
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
People there are some people who will just

286
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Kind of

287
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,839
Do whatever they're told their other people

288
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,167
Who feel like they have a higher calling to the profession

289
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
Gibbs and Librarians from several other departments

290
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
Felt that Higher Calling

291
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
They banded together and call themselves

292
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
The gorilla Library

293
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
Gorillas like the

294
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
Freedom fighter

295
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,039
Fighting for the freedom to not put little slips of red paper on books

296
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,087
Against the orders of management

297
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,951
Let's just say that we did not withdraw books because they had circulated

298
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,511
We we we generally held onto the collection

299
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,095
Jason says that other Guerrilla librarians

300
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
Snuck into the stack

301
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
Replaced

302
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
Lips with green ones

303
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
Thereby designating the book

304
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
The circulating book

305
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
I'm keeping it in the collection

306
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:05,663
The gorilla Librarians wanted to determine exactly how many books have been weeded and how many have been dumped

307
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
But nobody had any idea how many books are being taken away

308
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,063
And there was a risk that they'd never be able to find out the magnitude

309
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
This massive clearing

310
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
Because Kenneth Dallas

311
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
Decided

312
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Get rid

313
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,463
Of the physical card catalog

314
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
Those files full of index cards

315
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
Chronicling

316
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Buck

317
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
Card catalog is an artifact

318
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
But I will not

319
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:31,519
Supportive use of the card catalog is a working technology to help people find books anymore

320
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
It's not

321
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,079
And most of the library in the world

322
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Know that

323
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
And have moved on

324
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
He was right about the

325
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,991
Already at that point more than 90% of the nation's libraries

326
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
A computerized

327
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
Tarot card catalog

328
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,903
Earthquake itself allow the San Francisco Public Library to modernize their catalog

329
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,951
With the disaster relief money they were Gray

330
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
The library was able to get electronic catalog soft

331
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
So now logically

332
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
Delon wanted to get rid of the physical card catalog

333
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Which the library has stopped

334
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
Stop dating in 1991

335
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,775
San Francisco's old card catalog was not moved

336
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
To the new library

337
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,871
It is locked up and in accessible to the public

338
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,175
But this move to get rid of the old card catalog

339
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,223
Cause of surprisingly intense out

340
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Cry from the gorilla librarian

341
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,087
It wasn't just a matter of nostalgia or personal preference

342
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:22,719
Physical card catalog said exactly what was in the library before all the arbitrary weeding

343
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,535
If a book was red tagged and we did

344
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,351
It wouldn't be registered in the new digital system

345
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,423
It would be no record it ever existed

346
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
At all

347
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,007
Cancel the old card catalog was more than just

348
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
Card catalog

349
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
Card catalog is evidence

350
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
Evidence of a purge

351
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
To get to the card catalog

352
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
The Librarians pulled out their secret weapon

353
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
Nicholson Baker

354
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,367
I'm Nicholson Baker and I am a writer of

355
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
Books fiction nonfiction

356
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
And I became for a

357
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
Brief period of time

358
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
A library activist

359
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
Bigger is a writer of novels in essays

360
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
Celebrate the minutiae of daily life

361
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,823
Any 1994 Baker. National attention for a New Yorker article

362
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
Call about the disposal of physical card count

363
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
Has become increasingly common

364
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
How much upset Baker

365
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,295
A lot the San Francisco Public Library had a very ornate

366
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
Beautiful

367
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Card catalog

368
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,439
That feeling that you have when your fingers would dance over the little cardboard

369
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,487
Pieces and and you could tell

370
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
A subject

371
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,071
That was popular because the tops

372
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
We're darker there's all sorts of

373
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
You know tricks to

374
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
We're just

375
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
The gorilla Librarians reached out to Baker for help

376
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
But now it was 1996

377
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
And the new library was nearing completion

378
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
The Lost Books

379
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,455
Evidence only by their locked away card catalog

380
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,759
We're teetering on the edge of disregard

381
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,343
In their email to Nicholson Baker the Librarians wrote

382
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
You are the only one

383
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
Can save it now

384
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
Part of me thought of goddesses

385
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Just going to catch

386
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Complicated

387
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,071
The time Baker was living just across the bay in Berkeley

388
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,375
So we made a formal request

389
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
To inspect

390
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
The card catalog

391
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
Can a felon deny that request

392
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,775
So Baker sued the library

393
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
For access

394
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
To the card catalog

395
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,871
Never Sue anything

396
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,175
If you can avoid it and don't Sue kleiber

397
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,503
This lawsuit took a while it was a bit of a mess

398
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,599
But it automatically classify the card catalog is a public document

399
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
Now the library had to keep

400
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,719
And then Baker and the gorilla librarian

401
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
Got to work

402
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
In secret

403
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
You know you can imagine this with

404
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Kind of

405
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,655
Mission Impossible music on yes please

406
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,287
The gorilla librarian snuck into off-limits areas in the library

407
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,335
They took away books that were going to be destroyed

408
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
In other words

409
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
They stole them

410
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:56,063
The Gorillaz stockpiled hundreds and hundreds of library discards in their homes and their cars and their offices and

411
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
Lockers in boxes

412
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,415
All in the hope that they would someday be returned

413
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
Tool Library

414
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,999
Nicholson Baker stole books to

415
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,815
I was driving back and forth across the Bay Bridge

416
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
Car

417
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,167
Full of books that I had actually

418
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Found in

419
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,007
This place that was the deselection room

420
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
Baker ignored the staff only sign

421
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
And walked right into the deselection room

422
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
The basement storage

423
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
All the places

424
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
It's where the sfpl restoring books

425
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,807
He picked up a bunch of books that had no match in the online catalog

426
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
Real treasure

427
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
They had stored all these you know

428
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,951
2017 Century very valuable books and stuff

429
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,255
Baker along with the historian

430
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,327
Begin comparing the online catalog to be physical

431
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
Car catalog

432
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
As a cross reference the two lists

433
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
It turned out

434
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
Got a lot of books

435
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Books were missing

436
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,775
Way more than anyone had expect

437
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,359
Let me tell you what an opening-day celebration today

438
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,199
At last in April of 1996

439
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,503
The new main library opened its doors

440
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,319
With Panache

441
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,719
Nothing less than a parachute jump into Civic Center with the man holding the symbolic key to the new library

442
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,279
And weather in may of 1996

443
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
About a month after the library open

444
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,887
The gorilla Librarians organize an event

445
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
Anna Library Auditorium

446
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,007
Or Baker delivered a speech stating what he had found

447
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,615
Baker contended the Dowlen was responsible for a massive destruction of books

448
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:30,271
The systematic removal to a landfill that at least 200 thousand volumes

449
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:35,391
Set it right there in the library itself and

450
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
How to get really startled people

451
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:42,303
The phrase that got Baker the most attention was when he called this Mass disposal

452
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
A quote

453
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,631
Hate crime directed at the pass

454
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
This relate

455
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,983
Set Library management

456
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,799
Kind of minor dustup in san francisco

457
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,895
Where did began to spread that Baker was writing another story for the New Yorker

458
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,711
One specifically about this whole weeding to buy

459
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,063
So the president of the library commission road to the New Yorker zaditor at that

460
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,879
Attempted to kill the Peace by discrediting Baker

461
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
It didn't work

462
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,231
And Baker's article came out in October of 1996

463
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
It was called

464
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
The author versus the library

465
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,703
Current New Yorker article called it the Great Book Purge climbing more than 100,000 rare and one-of-a-kind book

466
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
Sprawled the job

467
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,055
And then things got a little out of hand

468
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
The library hit back

469
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
Condemning Baker

470
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
Accusing them of

471
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
Hate crime

472
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
I'm saying that he misunderstood the problem

473
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:36,319
They also tried to discredit him because of some bad Matthew have reported

474
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
It turns out

475
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,927
One of the Guerrilla Librarians had messed up the measurements

476
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
The old library shelves

477
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,767
In fact the new library

478
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,303
Had much more space for boy

479
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Turn the old one

480
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,143
It was a very bad area was very embarrassing

481
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,983
Although it didn't change the fact of a library had taken so many books to the dump

482
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,287
Then both side started logging into

483
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Tell tell each other

484
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,127
Has the local and national press piled on

485
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,943
One paper compared Baker to the Unabomber

486
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,247
It was basically an analog Twitter

487
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,087
I wasn't prepared to be part of it I didn't know that

488
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
I was

489
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
Getting into that

490
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
Times of battle

491
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
It was really ugly

492
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,279
And even from gorillas librarian Jason Gibbs a stamp

493
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,095
The whole Wheaton controversy got a little blown out of

494
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
Proportion

495
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,911
Probably was not as

496
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:26,239
Horrible is Nicholson Baker made it out but it was horrible enough

497
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,335
Meanwhile the new library itself had already been built

498
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,895
And it was judging from the influx of visitors

499
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
A success

500
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,223
The charges and counter-charges fly

501
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,319
Three times as many visitors stream for the doors of the new library

502
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,391
Indication that some book-lovers welcome the chain

503
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:51,327
Some of those books saved by the gorillas Librarians and boxes and lockers were transferred back into the collection

504
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,911
All the books and Jason Gibbs Department are in music made it back

505
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,471
He says that many of the other books did

506
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
They stayed gone

507
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
And many of them

508
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,055
Probably got the scar.

509
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,639
Nicholson Baker says he still has some of the Booksy stockpile

510
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,455
Given the painful experience of the controversy

511
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,015
The library wasn't really interested in resolving them

512
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
What is the end of the day

513
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,879
The controversy wasn't only about what to do with old books

514
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,440
It was a debate about what books are

515
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
Are they beautiful objects that week

516
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,280
Can smell and touch and collect

517
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:26,400
Or are they Eternal sources of knowledge accessible to everyone in The Ether

518
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
And it's both

519
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,752
In a given research Quest

520
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,800
You and I might want to

521
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
Find out what is in a book

522
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
In the fastest

523
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
Well nowadays it

524
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
It cements miraculous

525
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
Sometimes

526
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
You want

527
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:46,112
The words sometimes you want more than the words you want the words laid out on the page

528
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,928
Clearly Nicholson Baker can see dalian

529
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
Perspective

530
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,024
The baker maintains that we shouldn't give up on the printed page

531
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,352
His argument and the public battle around it in the 90s

532
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,192
Was a big reason why the San Francisco Public Library totally overhauled

533
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Collections

534
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
They made it a policy

535
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,848
But if a library branch is considering weeding the last copy of some book

536
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,432
They must send a copy to a subject specialist

537
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,736
Who will decide if it can be weeded or not

538
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,784
And for the books to do have to go

539
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,880
The San Francisco Public Library develop the community redistribution program

540
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,184
To make sure the extra copies of popular book

541
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
Bugs can live on somewhere else

542
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
We

543
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
Distribute them to schools

544
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,328
City colleges in prisons

545
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
Strangely enough

546
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,192
One of the biggest changes to the modern practice of weeding

547
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,496
It's something that kind of down on himself

548
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,776
Help establish

549
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
Online communication

550
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
Between Library

551
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,384
Ideal World

552
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,944
You might want to have every book that we just

553
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
Don't have the Shelf space for every book so either you

554
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,832
Rely on somebody else's shelves to hold the book

555
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:53,440
Some Library spell musty with an i and an e at the end instead of a y

556
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,256
For misleading ugly superseded

557
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
Trivial irrelevant

558
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
Or elsewhere

559
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,656
Like if a copy of the book is at another Library nearby

560
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:08,288
Jason Gibbs at the sfpl and Sharon McKellar across the bay at the Oakland Public Library

561
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,848
Can now communicate with each other instantly

562
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:14,944
So they can share book space and make different volumes available to readers in both cities

563
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:19,040
And this has huge implications for what gets we did and why

564
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
In this respect

565
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
Kenneth Dallas

566
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
Was very right

567
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,648
He certainly

568
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,232
Failed in terms of managing the collection by the

569
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
Succeeded to the extent of

570
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
Bringing us

571
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Set ceiling

572
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,888
Into the wider network of libraries online

573
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:40,288
And it's still because of Baker's 1996 lawsuit the San Francisco Public Library has kept the old card catalog

574
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,080
They're legally required to

575
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,128
The card catalog was a way of

576
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
Holding onto the memory

577
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,224
Of a quarter of a million books that they've gotten rid of

578
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
Those cabinets full of cards

579
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
Are still there in storage

580
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:57,952
Practically barricaded in by all kinds of other supplies but I'll go down and visit every now and then

581
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,744
Just to say hi

582
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
No just just to know it's there

583
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:09,216
After the Sweden debacle Nicholson Baker became even more vested in philosophies and practices of Arc

584
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,288
And went on to publish a book that touched on all this

585
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
Call double-fold

586
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,920
It looks at these event in the much broader context of the digitization of Libor

587
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,784
And this book is now commonly assigned in masters programs in library science

588
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,600
We read the Nicholson Baker book in library School

589
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,416
That Sharon McKellar again from the Oakland Public Library

590
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,488
She says that the debacle at the San Francisco Public Library

591
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
Has become a case study about weeding

592
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,840
Why we do we need and how we should we eat and

593
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
What could be done

594
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
How to do it well

595
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,448
What to avoid in all that kind of

596
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,032
And when it's done well with care and consideration

597
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
Waiting isn't so bad at all

598
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,176
For me reading is fun at the chance to really touch the books and

599
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,480
See how they're doing and see what people are interested in

600
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
That's what all this comes down to

601
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
It's what people are interested

602
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
Reading isn't just about what the cut

603
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
It's also about what to keep

604
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,232
It's about what the public wants to read

605
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,048
Your voice does matter and

606
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
We're maintaining a collection

607
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,888
For the public and for the people who use it

608
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,472
Until every time you check out a book from the library

609
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
Your Casanova

610
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,568
Your local librarian roving the stack

611
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,640
To keep this title in circulation

612
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
For everyone

613
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,200
To read

614
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,768
Coming up more radical librarian doing good in

615
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
This time

616
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
On horseback

617
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
After this

618
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
Between the beats

619
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,984
Bongs and chatter of our devices

620
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,568
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

621
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
If

622
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:55,200
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

623
00:25:55,456 --> 00:26:01,088
Talking to me and my wife is in another room in a kid is another remembrall hearing that voice

624
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,880
Technology talk to us

625
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
It is a creation of Sonic trap

626
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,000
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

627
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,584
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

628
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,632
To make them more human

629
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,472
Turn the living room lights on

630
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
Okay

631
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
Dim the living room lights to 50

632
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
2%

633
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Okay

634
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,272
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

635
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,320
Makes for a much more natural

636
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Experience

637
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,136
Turn the living room lights on

638
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,208
Dim the living room lights

639
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
50%

640
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:46,656

Is impacting our health

643
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,032

655
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,152
Preserve some part of our cultural heritage

656
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:34,784
And when we were producing our story this week about the preservation of the sfpl book collections

657
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,344

For the Smithsonian

717
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,400
One County would start a pack horse Library

718
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,936
Another County would hear about it

719
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
They would want one

720
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:38,592
Been that Community would ask the WPA2 let them hire carriers

721
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,432
Many of them were women between 25 and 35

722
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,760
There weren't people coming in from outside to

723
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,600
Take jobs from people who were in the community they were local women

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:40,288
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
