1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
This is 99% invisible

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,328
I'm Roman Mars

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:09,984
On this so we tell stories about what we make and what it says about

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,752
Does human

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:14,080
But we never write those things on a 5-star scale

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,408
The anthropocene reviewed is here to correct that oversight

7
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,944
I love the show

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,320
By John Green he's the author of best-selling books like the Fault in Our Stars and Turtles all the way down

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:30,720
Kelso make some of the best stuff on YouTube with his brother Hank today we're going to be sure two of my favorite episodes of his new

10
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,280
Podcast that I think will be of particular interest

11
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:37,888
To an IPI listener have an interview with John about a lot of things like

12
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,960
Sports and Marine telepopmusik as an adult

13
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,752
I think you're really going to like it

14
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:47,104
After I got done talking with John I just felt good all day about life

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,872
Is great

16
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
But first

17
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,432
Here's an episode

18
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,224
The anthropocene reviewed

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,880
Hello and welcome to the anthropocene reviewed

20
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,184
A podcast where we review different facets

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,744
To be human centered planet on a five-star scale

22
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,328
Today I'll be reviewing a 17000 year old painting

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,376
And the Taco Bell breakfast menu

24
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,752
Let's start with the painting

25
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,152
So if you've ever been or had a child you will likely already be familiar with handstand

26
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,736
Cancel the first figurative art made by both our kids

27
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,552
Somewhere between the ages of two and three

28
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,136
Play children spread the fingers of one hand out across a piece

29
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
Paper

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
And then with the help of a parent

31
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,488
Trace their five finger

32
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:41,632
I remember my son's face as he lifted his hand and looked absolutely shocked

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,680
To see the shape of his hand

34
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
Still on the paper

35
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
A semi permanent record

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
Himself

37
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:52,128
I am extremely happy that my children are no longer three

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,968
And yet to look at their little hands from those early artworks

39
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,272
Is to be inundated with a strange

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
Soul splitting Joy

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Those pictures

42
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,392
Remind me that they are not just growing up

43
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
But also growing away from me

44
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
Running toward their own lives

45
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,120
But of course that's meaning I am applying to their hand stencils

46
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,936
Complicated relationship between art

47
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
And its viewers

48
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,288
Is never more fraught than when we are looking deeply into the

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
In September of 1940 and 18 year old mechanic named Marcel Ravi. Was walking his dog robe

50
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,784
In the countryside of Southwestern France

51
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
When the dog disappeared down a hole

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,488
Robot eventually returned but the next day Robbie. Went to the spot with three friends to explore the whole

53
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,048
And after quite a bit of digging they discovered

54
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
Cave

55
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,120
With walls covered with paintings

56
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,704
Including over 900 paintings of animals

57
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,264
Horses Stags bison

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,312
It also species that are now extinct

59
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,104
Including a woolly rhinoceros

60
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,432
The paintings were astonishingly detailed and Vivid

61
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
With red yellow and

62
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,040
Black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments

63
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,344
That were usually blown through a narrow

64
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,904
Tube possibly a hollowed bone

65
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
Onto the walls of the cave

66
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
But eventually be a stamp

67
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
These artworks

68
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,584
At least 17000 years old

69
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,912
To the boys who visited the cave that day

70
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,240
We're so profoundly moved by the art they saw

71
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,544
That they camped outside the cave

72
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
Protected

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
For over a year

74
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
After World War II

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
The French government took over protection of the science

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
And the cave was open to the public in 1948

77
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,624
When Picasso Celtic cave paintings on a visit that year

78
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
He reportedly said

79
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696
We have invented nothing

80
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,512
There are many Mysteries at let's go

81
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,328
Why for instance are there no paintings of reindeer

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,912
Which we know where the primary source of food for the Paleolithic

83
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Humans who lived

84
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Cave

85
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,776
Why would they so much more focused on painting animals

86
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
Spin painting human forms

87
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
Why are certain areas of the cave filled with images including pictures on the ceiling that required the building

88
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
Scaffolding

89
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
How to create

90
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
What other areas have only a few faint

91
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,904
And with the painting spiritual here are sacred animals

92
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
Or were they practical

93
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,768
Here is a guide to some of the animals that might kill you

94
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:22,911
Aside from the animals there are nearly a thousand abstract signs and shapes we cannot in

95
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Interpret

96
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
And also several negative hand stencil

97
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,799
As they are known by Art historians

98
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
These are the paintings that most interests me

99
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,479
They were created by pressing one hand with fingers splayed against the wall

100
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
The cave

101
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
And then blowing Pig

102
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,855
Leaving the area around the hand-painted

103
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,951
Similar hand stencils have been found in caves around the world

104
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,767
From Indonesia to Spain to us

105
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
Australia to the Americas

106
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,631
To Africa we have found these memories

107
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,679
Of hands from 15

108
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Or 30 or even

109
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,007
40000 years ago

110
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:04,127
These hands pencils remind us of how different life was in the distant past

111
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:10,527
Amputations likely from frostbite are common in Europe and so you often C- hand stencils with three

112
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
Eeyore for fingers

113
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
And life was short and difficult

114
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,439
As many as 1/4 of women died in childbirth

115
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,023
Around 50% of children died before the age of

116
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Define

117
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:26,143
But they also remind us that the humans of the past whereas human

118
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
As we are

119
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
Their hands

120
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
Indistinguishable

121
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
From hours

122
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,383
These communities hunted and gathered and there were no large caloric surpluses

123
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,015
So every healthy person would have had to contribute to the acquisition of food and water

124
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
And yet somehow

125
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,623
They still made time to create art

126
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
Almost as if art

127
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Isn't optional

128
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
For humans

129
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:56,351
We see all kinds of hand stenciled on Cave walls children and adults

130
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,167
But almost always the fingers are spread

131
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Like my kids

132
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:07,615
But it's fascinating and a little strange that so many Paleolithic humans

133
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,943
You couldn't possibly have had any contact with each other

134
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,759
Created the same paintings the same way

135
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
Paintings that we are still make

136
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,975
But then again what the lascaux art means to me is likely very different from what it meant to the

137
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
People who made it

138
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,351
Some academics theorized that the hand stencils were part of Hunting Ridge

139
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:34,751
Then there's always the possibility that the hand was just a convenient model situated at the end of the wrist

140
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
To me though

141
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
The hand stencils at Nesco say

142
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
I was

143
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Ear

144
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
They say

145
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
You are not new

146
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,807
And because they are negative prints surrounded by Red pigment

147
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,647
They also look to me like something out of a horror movie

148
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439
Like ghostly hands

149
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
Reaching up from somebody back

150
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
They remind me that

151
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
As I was Walker Road

152
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
All history

153
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Is current

154
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,447
The lascaux cave has been closed

155
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
The public for many years now

156
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,567
Too many contemporary humans breathing inside of it

157
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
Led to the growth of mold

158
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Enlighten

159
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
Which is damaged some of the art

160
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
Just the act of looking at something

161
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Can ruin it

162
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
I guess

163
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,599
But tourists can still visit an imitation cave

164
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
Called Wesco to

165
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
In which the artwork

166
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
Has been meticulously recreated

167
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
Humans making fake cave art

168
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
To save real cave art

169
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,399
Mayfield like Peak anthropocene Behavior

170
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:41,055
But I have to confess that even though I am a jaded and cynical semi-professional reviewer of human activity

171
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,383
I actually find it overwhelmingly hopeful

172
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,455
Bed for teenagers and a dog named robot

173
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,039
Discover the cave with 17000 year old hand prints

174
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,367
That the cave was so overwhelmingly beautiful

175
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,439
The two of those teenagers devoted themselves to its

176
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Protection

177
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,791
Annette when we humans became a danger to that caves

178
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
Beauty

179
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
We agreed to stop going

180
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
Moscow is there

181
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
You cannot visit

182
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,007
You can go to the fake cave we built

183
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
NC nearly identical hand stencils

184
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
But you will know

185
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
This is not the thing itself

186
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
But a shadow of it

187
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
This is a handprint

188
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
But not a hand

189
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
This is a memory

190
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
Did you cannot return to

191
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
All of which

192
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
Makes the cave

193
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,023
Very much like the past it represent

194
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,095
I get the hand print stencils at Glasgow

195
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
4 and a half Stars

196
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,335
Exigo a listener to this podcast named Steven

197
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,943
Emailed me to ask if I would consider reviewing the Taco Bell breakfast menu

198
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
Good idea

199
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,087
Albeit one that would require me to eat a fair bit at Taco Bell

200
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:02,207
Which is a fast food restaurant chain with over 7,000 restaurants around the world

201
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
That was founded by a Marine Corps veteran

202
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
Glen Bell

203
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,375
Glenn did not start out as a Taco Guy

204
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,727
After serving in World War II he returned to his native Southern California

205
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,287
To seek his fortune in the burger business

206
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,151
Aranda restaurant in San Bernardino called Bells Drive-In in 1948

207
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
Is business did okay

208
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
But across the street

209
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,319
A family-owned Mexican restaurant called the mitla cafe

210
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
Whistling

211
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
Lots of tacos

212
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,463
Including its famous hard shell tacos

213
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:41,119
Bellwood off and eat at the mitla cafe and then go back to his Hamburger Stand and try to reverse-engineer those

214
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Popular tacos

215
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,191
But you can never figure it out

216
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,287
So eventually he became friends with the family that owned the mitla

217
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
And they showed him the recipe

218
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,151
Bell started making tacos soon thereafter

219
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:59,807
Side note the mitla cafe was the setting for an important moment in American history in the early 1940s public

220
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,135
Pools and other services were segregated in San Bernardino

221
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
Latinos couldn't swim at the pool

222
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
Or sit in certain sections of movie theaters

223
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,559
Some businesses had whites only signs

224
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
And many schools were segregated

225
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,167
In a series of meetings held at the mitla cafe

226
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:20,031
Latino church and Civic leaders developed a plan to sue the city of San Bernardino

227
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
And they won

228
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:27,711
In fact the case Lopez versus II was cited by the Supreme Court and its famous Brown versus

229
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
Board of Education decision

230
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,807
The found segregated schools to be illegal

231
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,671
Will return to Taco Bell momentarily but one last note about the meatball Cafe

232
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
It's still open

233
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,303
And today is run by the fourth generation of the family who founded it

234
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:48,959
I've eaten there actually and it will not surprise you to learn that their tacos are vastly in calc

235
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,775
Superior to Taco Bell tacos

236
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,615
Taco Bell isn't really in the business of being

237
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Good

238
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
It aims to be

239
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Good enough

240
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
Inconsistent

241
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
And inexpensive

242
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:08,415
Right so of course the recipe for Taco Bell tacos was stolen by a white restaurant owner from a local Center for Latino community

243
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Unity and activism

244
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:14,303
But the owners of the mitla cafe never publicly expressed any resentment toward Bell

245
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,143
One member of the family Irene Montano magnanimously set of him

246
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
He was a self-starter

247
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
And he did push those tacos

248
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,847
Indeed after opening the first Taco Bell in Downey California in 1962

249
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,199
New franchises of Taco Bell spread rapidly throughout the West Coast

250
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,759
Back then the menu was extremely simple

251
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:38,367
Tacos tostadas burritos Frijoles and chili burgers

252
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
And everything

253
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
Cost $0.19

254
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
Around the box safety in today's money

255
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
People loved it

256
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
By 1967

257
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,607
They were 100 Taco Bells

258
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
And they were 868

259
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,959
When Bell sold his company to PepsiCo

260
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
In 1978

261
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
425 million dollars

262
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
Selling Taco Bell Glen

263
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,431
Pursue the true passion of his life

264
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,503
1/4 scale model train Adventure Park

265
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
Call Bell Gardens

266
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
Bell was a lifelong model train enthusiast

267
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
But the park which had no rides that weren't quarter scale model trains went bankrupt after a few years

268
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
I mention all of this

269
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
Because I think it's important to understand

270
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
Glen Bell was not

271
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
Like

272
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,495
Passionate about Mexican food

273
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,567
He saw an opportunity in the marketplace

274
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
And he filled it

275
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,503
I'm not trying to bash Taco Bell I've had many enjoyable meals there in my younger and less nutrition Orient

276
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Today's

277
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
And per dollar spent

278
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,415
Taco Bell offers more caloric energy than almost any other restaurant

279
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
A Big Mac at McDonald's

280
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,559
Two Rivers about 1.45 calories per Penny spent

281
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
A Taco Bell beefy Fritos burrito

282
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:58,239
Offers an astonishing 4.26 calories per penny

283
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,895
Also I recently ate a Taco Bell beefy Fritos burrito under the guise of research for this review and

284
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,199
For about 5 minutes after eating it

285
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
I felt almost euphoric

286
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,575
It was flavorful and intoxicating mix

287
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,367
Crunchy and chewy

288
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
And strangely sweet

289
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,815
The beef was stringing the tortilla suboptimal and I suspect I would be horrified by a thorough accounting of the in

290
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,375
Environmental and socio-political costs of the

291
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
The beefy Fritos burrito

292
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,471
But still for those five minutes

293
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
I felt pleasantly

294
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
And entirely

295
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
Satiate

296
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,175
10 minutes after that of course I began to feel extremely unwell but

297
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,735
That might be down to my generally weak Constitution

298
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,783
Institution rather than any fault of

299
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
The food itself

300
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,391
All I'm saying is the Taco Bell is not

301
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Like

302
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,719
A mission-driven Institution

303
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
It seeks to turn a profit

304
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:59,423
And that's why I find it so fascinating the Taco Bell didn't serve breakfast until 2012

305
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,519
Burger King served its first breakfast in 1979

306
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,871
McDonald's introduce the Egg McMuffin way back in 1972

307
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,687
Maybe Taco Bell was late to breakfast

308
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
Because they didn't want to recreate

309
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
Actual Mexican breakfast food

310
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,367
Which is excellent but there's very little resemblance to the hash

311
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,927
Browns and cinnamon flavored donut holes

312
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,999
The Taco Bell eventually released as part of their breakfasts

313
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
Just menu

314
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:31,167
All of which goes to show again that Taco Bell as a company is not and never has been in

315
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
Twisted in Mexican food

316
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
Except for what could be

317
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
Efficiently appropriated from it

318
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:42,431
Which is why the taste profile of its breakfast menu more closely resembles that have Burger King

319
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
Did anything at the mitla cafe

320
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,527
I thought the donut holes were good

321
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
But it's hard to mess up fried dough

322
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,903
I found a grilled breakfast burrito Fiesta potato

323
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
To be

324
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
Like its name a bit overcomplicated

325
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
The stand out to me was the breakfast

326
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
French rap

327
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,655
Which wraps hash browns bacon eggs and cheese into a grilled tortilla

328
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
And that wasn't bad but

329
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,847
Mostly my Taco Bell breakfast was what Taco Bell's frantic and Relentless marketing campaign

330
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
Seem to fear the most

331
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
It was boring

332
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,783
I find it revealing that while there are Taco Bell's in Romania

333
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
And Australia

334
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
And Brazil

335
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
You won't find one in Mexico

336
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,487
Detroit twice in 1992 and 2007

337
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,863
But both times the restaurants face the same fate as Glenn Bells railroad Adventureland

338
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,447
You can add a valve to the end of every menu item

339
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,519
And you can make your catchphrase yo quiero Taco Bell

340
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,335
But if you can't sell your tacos in Mexico

341
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
Bank Mexican

342
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
I get to Taco Bell breakfast menu

343
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
2 Stars

344
00:15:54,111 --> 00:16:00,255
Chanel ears my interview with the creator of the anthropocene reviewed

345
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
John Green

346
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
When someone asks you what you do

347
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
What in the world do you say

348
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,263
I usually say that I work in educational video so that they don't

349
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,567
Ask more questions

350
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
But if I'm

351
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Feeling

352
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,991
A little more talkative I usually say that I'm a writer and a Utah

353
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,087
But I guess now I'm also a podcaster so I don't know what I do

354
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,647
How do you describe the anthropocene reviewed

355
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,463
Beatrice interviewed is show

356
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Where I

357
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Look at

358
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Different

359
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,143
Facets of the human centered planet and then review them on a 5-star scale

360
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
It started out as

361
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
I'd like a bit

362
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,007
It started out as a joke I had with my brother

363
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
Because of Yelp

364
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,127
And Amazon reviews and Goodreads that

365
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:54,527
Everything now is reviewed on a five-star scale and everything gets a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down a wreck

366
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807
Commander it don't recommend

367
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
And

368
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,159
What if we applied that reviewing

369
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
Framework

370
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
2

371
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
Like traffic cones

372
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,839
And that was the initial joke that I made with him or like argyle socks

373
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
And it goes like

374
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
It's good it's a funny bit

375
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,471
And so I think he ended up making a video

376
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
Where he use the bit

377
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
And then

378
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
I ended up

379
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,407
Writing an essay about diet dr. pepper and

380
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Canada geese

381
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,735
And at the end of writing is essays I was like

382
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,807
You know this isn't very funny and I kind of thought that

383
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
It was going to be a funny

384
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
Bing

385
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,415
But I like it

386
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,511
And it interests me and because I started out my career as a book reviewer

387
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
It felt

388
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,119
Kind of like going home to me in a way even though like

389
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
It is

390
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
Obviously

391
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,239
A little sticky to be reviewing

392
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
For instance

393
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,567
Colorado on a five-star scale

394
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:54,687
There is something about the value judgment thing that's inherent to reviewing

395
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
That interest me

396
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,551
Is it a healthy thing that we are reviewing everything and if I start scale

397
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
In the world

398
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,159
Yeah probably give it to Stars

399
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:10,047
I definitely understand the urge to make simple qualitative judgments

400
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
About

401
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
Experian

402
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
But

403
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,751
If you read one-star Yelp reviews or you read one star Goodreads reviews

404
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
I make a lot of times there's

405
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,151
Some missing of nuance to put it generously

406
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,479
But also if you read a lot of 5-star Amazon reviews

407
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
There's a lot of missing of nuance

408
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,831
Yeah you know sometimes I read reviews of

409
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Of my own book

410
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
I love you like

411
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
We both know it's not that good

412
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,487
Play

413
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,863
I wish it were I wish it were the book that you're describing and I'm so grateful that like

414
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,263
The book ended up in the hands of a reader so generous that they were able to make the book much better than the one I wrote

415
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
But

416
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
I do feel like it kind of oversimplifies human experience and it also gives us this constant urge to review Ave

417
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Everything we do

418
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,783
Like now it's difficult to have a meal

419
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,575
And not think about it in the

420
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
The context

421
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Of

422
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
A recommend don't recommend

423
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
Spectrum

424
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,487
And I don't know that I did that

425
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,767
Before the age

426
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Good night

427
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,119
So when I was talking to

428
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:22,751
My producer and editor on the show is news crispr Rubio is dude we were talking about which

429
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,079
Stories to do highlight of the anthropocene reviewed

430
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
I said

431
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
I think I want to do to

432
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
NOK paintings in

433
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
Taco Bell breakfast menu

434
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,783
And pennies and Piggly Wiggly

435
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,063
Coso4

436
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,111
I was like no no no those are two

437
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,719
So is that how you view them

438
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,815
Yeah I try to pair them in ways that make sense

439
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
Tumi

440
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,959
So for instance when I was writing about the cave paintings at lascaux

441
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:58,335
I wanted to also right about the Taco Bell breakfast menu in part because it seems

442
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,919
So different it seems like a huge contrast

443
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
But also

444
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Because

445
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,295
Really fascinated by the way that

446
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
People

447
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
Try

448
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
2

449
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,903
Make an impact

450
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,463
On the world or they try to leave

451
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:19,327
A trace of themselves and I was fascinated by the way that Glenn Bell

452
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,935
The founder of Taco Bell tried to do that and by the way that the

453
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,007
People who were painting the cave paintings at lascaux tried

454
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,287
To do that

455
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,639
I'm especially curious about the combination of Hawaiian pizza and viral meningitis

456
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,967
What made you choose this

457
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,319
Well some would argue that they're both forms of suffering

458
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,391
I read the viral meningitis

459
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,207
Essay before I wrote the Hawaiian pizza essay

460
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,767
And at the end of the viral meningitis essay

461
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,559
I was thinking about

462
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
Pal

463
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
There are all these

464
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:59,263
Phenomena in human life that are really resistant to language I think physical pain is the one that's

465
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,311
Perhaps most dramatically resistant

466
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
2 language

467
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,383
But for me there's also something about

468
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,431
Taste that's resistant to language

469
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
And

470
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:11,039
One of the reasons we fight I think about Hawaiian pizza

471
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
Is

472
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,903
Because we almost cannot describe to each other how it taste

473
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
To us

474
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,464
And so

475
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,768
I think some people say well Hawaiian pizza

476
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
Is amazing and your

477
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:29,216
You know obviously wrong to hate it and then the people who hated are like no no no no no you don't understand

478
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
How'd it taste

479
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
Tumi

480
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,616
And indeed we don't is it between May one of my pet peeves with

481
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,920
No basis whatsoever so it's not like

482
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,992
You know like I know I'm not necessarily right is I hate

483
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,064
When people use food words to describe other things

484
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,624
Like I hate it when somebody says that

485
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,696
Prose is delicious or something like that

486
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,024
All kind of makes me want to die

487
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,144
So goes the other way too like you can't use food words for other things you can use them only for food and there's not enough of them

488
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,984
Yeah well and even the food words that do exist

489
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
I don't know what they mean to someone else

490
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,128
Like I don't really know what Sumptuous means

491
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,456
Anyone who says that Hawaiian pizza is delicious

492
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
My definition of delicious

493
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,624
Doesn't include Hawaiian pizza and so I'm already I'm already lost

494
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,208
I have no way in and they can say oh it's a wonderful mix of

495
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Sweet and sour

496
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,816
And I understand what sweet and sour taste like

497
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,120
But that is not a wonderful mix of

498
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:35,776
To me until it's that personalization of experience and then the urge to share experience like we we all deaths

499
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Desperately wanting

500
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
Other people

501
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,640
To hear us and to hear our stories

502
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,432
Listen to know what our feelings feel like

503
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
And they can't

504
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,040
The temperature to show is literally everything on Earth

505
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,576
Kind of centered around

506
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
When humans

507
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
Orthodontist

508
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Species on Earth

509
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
Yeah kinda

510
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
And

511
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,512
How do you then choose things to talk about

512
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,328
I choose what to write about partly based

513
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
On

514
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
Wisner suggestions

515
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
So

516
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
Wizards can write in

517
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:08,800
And a lot of times they have a really interesting ideas or ideas about why something is in

518
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
Everything that I hadn't thought about

519
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
4

520
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,736
The Taco Bell breakfast menu is actually an example of that I've never thought about the Taco Bell breakfast menu until somebody wrote

521
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,040
To ask me to review it and then

522
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,856
I was like this isn't that interesting and

523
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:28,256
But then I fell way down the Glen Bell rabbit hole and ended up reading Glen Bells like self-published

524
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,304
Commissioned biography

525
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
And

526
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
At the end of that I was

527
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Totally

528
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
Fascinated by y Taco Bell

529
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,472
Didn't have a breakfast menu for so long

530
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
But I also have a running list

531
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,312
Topics that

532
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
I

533
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
Care about and I

534
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,432
Interested in and that I think I have a way into

535
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
Whether it's a story I want to tell about my life

536
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Or

537
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,320
Just a story I find really fascinating

538
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Like the cave paintings at lascaux

539
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,904
I learned about those

540
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
In my twenties

541
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:02,048
And I just spent a lot of time thinking about them and reading about them

542
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,608
And so I felt ready to write that

543
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,168
I mean each of these reviews

544
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:11,008
It becomes a small Memoir was that always your intention

545
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,104
Initially my idea for the show

546
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
Was that

547
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,664
I was going to be

548
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
Separate from the reviews

549
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,296
I would be like an authority on everything

550
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:28,672
I was going to be an authority on Canada geese and diet dr. pepper and cave painting

551
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,720
And the Taco Bell breakfast menu

552
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,024
And who I was didn't matter because I was

553
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
The authority

554
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,376
And my wife read the first couple of essays

555
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
And she said

556
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,960
You know I don't buy you

557
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
As

558
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,824
Authoritative expert in the taste of dr. pepper

559
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,176
I just don't think I don't think you're a chemical engineer I don't think

560
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,480
That you're a professional taster

561
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
And

562
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,320
I'm more interested in what your relationship is

563
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,904
That's when it became more memory

564
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
And

565
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,768
I do write about myself and I do write really personal things about myself

566
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,072
But I'm very careful

567
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
To protect

568
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,680
The parts of me that I need to protect

569
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
If that makes sense

570
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
Because I wasn't always careful

571
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
About that

572
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
And

573
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,848
And now I feel like I have

574
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,456
When I was younger I wanted so badly

575
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
To be

576
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
No no

577
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
I think what I wanted was to have

578
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
People like me

579
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,208
For some reason I wanted especially for people who didn't know me well

580
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
To like me

581
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:42,144
And it just didn't seem like that was such an incredibly desirable outcome

582
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
To have

583
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
Strangers

584
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
Like you

585
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,080
When versions of that started to happen to me I almost immediately

586
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,616
Recognized

587
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
That

588
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
What I

589
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,456
Thought it would give me

590
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,064
Was not what it was giving me because I never felt and I still don't feel

591
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Likes

592
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
Strangers Like Me

593
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
I feel like they

594
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
Like

595
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
A

596
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,792
Construction that is only tangentially related to me

597
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:13,120
I'm obsessed with this thing Keanu Reeves said once

598
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
He said I love Keanu Reeves a lot

599
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,008
Someday I might someday I might write it Keanu Reeves and

600
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
La piscine review

601
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Review

602
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,872
That one time Keanu Reeves in an interview said

603
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
I'm Mickey Mouse

604
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,968
They don't know who's inside the suit

605
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
And

606
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,320
When my work started to become more publicly known

607
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
That's how I felt

608
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,416
I didn't really feel like people like me I feel like they like Mickey Mouse

609
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,464
I was inside the suit

610
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:42,560
But I think the difference between Keanu Reeves in me is that Keanu Reeves

611
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
Knew who he was

612
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,656
He knew who is inside of the suit but I kind of didn't

613
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
Do you find it when you

614
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,312
Because you listen to a lot of podcasts and I assume

615
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,848
Before that or maybe

616
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:01,248
Listen to a lot of public radio and stuff when you find like a little tidbit of personal knowledge like when Terry Gross Road

617
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,296
Feels something to little about herself

618
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,624
Does it fill you with delight the way it fills me with delight

619
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:13,536
It does it does especially when Terry Gross does it

620
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,632
Because I've been listening to Terry Gross for like 25 years so

621
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Winter growth

622
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:23,520
Shares even the smallest detail about her life I am completely

623
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,592
Oh I love it it's such a good feeling I just like I hope

624
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Oh

625
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Well that

626
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,456
That's always what I think to myself

627
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,784
Describe the piles of CDs on something like oh my God

628
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,112
Chest hours navigating yes

629
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,416
Now I could picture the entire home

630
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
Are we one of these

631
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,744
Learn about you overtime

632
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
And when I think they

633
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
Fun is

634
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,680
And I don't know if I would anticipated this app from reading your books and

635
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,216
Other things in from Blood Brothers

636
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
But you love sports

637
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:01,920
Or certain Sports I mean my growing-up experience was that the people who love sports were the people who

638
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Who hated me

639
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:08,576
Ipf the same that these are not linked

640
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,160
Traits that you've decoupled them for me in these ways that I found really

641
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,696
Profound and so

642
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,744
You talk about penalty shootouts work

643
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
I know your

644
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:20,608
Love of AFC Wimbledon and in an Indy 500

645
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,400
Could afford me as a subject

646
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
The fact that you love

647
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
Indianapolis 500

648
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
I think that you could assemble the parts

649
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,568
Of your character

650
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
And

651
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
I could construct a version of you

652
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
That would hate the internet

653
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
500

654
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,552
Well yeah and it passed me did hate the Indy 500 in Panda past me did hates

655
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:43,904
Sports there's a lot of my first novel Looking for Alaska that something like I hate

656
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
Sports and I hate people

657
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
Two players

658
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:53,120
Support or participate in any way in the sports industrial complex and that was taken right

659
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,936
Get out of my high school self

660
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,312
I I would watch people care about sports and I would just think to myself

661
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,336
This is

662
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,360
Actually

663
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,896
The dumbest thing

664
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,992
That you can do with what Mary Oliver called your one Wild

665
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,552
Precious life like this is the worst

666
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Possible

667
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Way

668
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,624
For you to use

669
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,648
Use your resources

670
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,000
I've heard anything in adulthood if not to judge anyone else

671
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,840
West you become them

672
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:32,544
In the fullness of time you will become all of the people that you claim to revile

673
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
I think what I love about

674
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,896
Sports is actually the same thing I love about going to

675
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
Church which is

676
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,200
Not

677
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:43,808
Much to do with the extensible topic at hand buttons

678
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
Instead

679
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,392
The pleasure and joy that comes from

680
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:51,744
A bunch of people who otherwise might not have a lot in common orienting

681
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,792
There's love in the same direction

682
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
And I think there is a lot of value in that

683
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
And

684
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,728
I think what I like about sports's is the community aspect of it

685
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
Which is

686
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,312
Why I enjoy the Indy 500 so much

687
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
Much because it's

688
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,104
Huge

689
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
Gathering

690
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,944
All kinds

691
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,736
Of human being

692
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
And

693
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,856
The sport to say that its secondary would be an over stay

694
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
I mean there's no place

695
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
In the Indianapolis 500

696
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
Seating

697
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:29,376
Where you can see all of the Indianapolis 500 so it can't possibly be about the sport because you live

698
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,912
Literally can't see the sport

699
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
From inside the stadium

700
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,544
It has to be about something else and I think what it's about is

701
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,616
Tradition and shared experience

702
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
And being

703
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
In a community

704
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,992
I think really like in the end sports are about being

705
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,272
Sing together

706
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
I found in my life and I

707
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,112
I sent this in your life is that

708
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
You spent

709
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,160
A good section

710
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,976
Commune your life being defined by the things you hated

711
00:30:55,232 --> 00:31:00,352
And then you took a hard pivot enjoying being to find more by the things you loved

712
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,960
Do you know why and how that happened in both you and I

713
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
I do not

714
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
No

715
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,848
When I was a teenager

716
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,944
If you'd asked me to say like 10 things about myself

717
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,016
I would have told you 10 things that I hate it

718
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,808
I would have told you about

719
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,344
What I was supposed to

720
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,416
I would have told you about what I thought was

721
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,256
Stupid and embarrassing and ridiculous

722
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,072
About The Human Experience I would have told you like

723
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,400
How deeply I reviled the Spice Girls

724
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,936
Who by the way

725
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,520
Need good pop music

726
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,104
I think I got fed up with it I got fed up with irony I got

727
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,384
Fed up with sarcasm

728
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,224
I got fed up with this urge to create distance between

729
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,016
Myself and emotion

730
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,856
I wanted to be cool and I thought that to be cool was to

731
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
To be distant

732
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,928
And then I stopped wanting to be cool

733
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
Because

734
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,768
To be cool this to be a form of cold

735
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:05,376
And I don't want to be distant from emotional experience

736
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,192
I think the risk of that is that it

737
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,520
They make you into a sentimentalist it may make you

738
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,336
Intuit some sort of like cheesy

739
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,384
Version of yourself

740
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,944
For me if that's the cost

741
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
Having

742
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
Tyrannize

743
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,088
Emotional experiences

744
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
It's worth

745
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
The cost

746
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,720
It took me a long time to like be okay with

747
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
That urge

748
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Within Me

749
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
I just think that

750
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Ironic

751
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,400
Detachment

752
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
Is

753
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
The single most

754
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,984
Overrated

755
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,800
Characteristic and human being

756
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:49,920
I like emotion I like to feel things I like to feel them intensely

757
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:54,528
And I like to be able to ask big questions without

758
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
Creating a lot of distance

759
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,600
It's between myself and the question

760
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:04,256
If you were to review other things near life the science Sports in the Spice Girls what are some of the things that

761
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
Had the most change

762
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,096
1 * or 0 stars to 5 stars

763
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,144
Oh that's interesting

764
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,960
Oh I mean the biggest one is marriage

765
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,752
I mean my

766
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,080
My 17 year old self thought that marriage

767
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
Which was

768
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
The

769
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
Stupidest

770
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,688
Institution

771
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,968
The human turd ever

772
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,248
Steve dove

773
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
End

774
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
I thought

775
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
Love being married

776
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:32,928
That guy was crazy I really really

777
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,976
Really love being married

778
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,560
I think the institution of marriage has gotten a lot better since I was

779
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,864
It's gotten a lot more inclusive

780
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
It hasn't

781
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
Gone

782
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,216
All the way to where it needs to be throughout the world but

783
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,240
I think that's one

784
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
In general

785
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:53,152
Pop music I was very dismissive of pop music when I was younger and

786
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,528
Now I listen to a lot of pop songs like you know that song Old Town Road by Lil Nas X

787
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,880
It's been mentioned a few times but I actually haven't heard it but I I've heard good things

788
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:07,488
I genuinely recommend that you listen to it it's a good song is it good enough

789
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:13,888
Tab my kids play at 40 or 50 times a day everyday no but it's very good I've also gone

790
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,656
One from

791
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,728
One star to five stars on

792
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
Genre fiction

793
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
Like mystery novels romance novels

794
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,616
I love a good romance

795
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,920
I used to think that

796
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:30,272
If they all end the same way and they're so cheesy and they're just wish fulfilling

797
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
Well

798
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,136
Shut up like what's wrong with wish fulfillment

799
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:38,976
Like what when did we become opposed to fulfilling wishes

800
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,584
I can go on that I've

801
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:50,240
If anything I got I probably know too critical of my high school self because that means it like in the next 10

802
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:55,360
10 years I'm going to become my high school self again so that the so that I have to like cease being critical toward him

803
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,200
The thing about my high school self and I don't know if you were like this

804
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
This is that I was very

805
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Dismissive

806
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,344
Pop culture looks like large swath

807
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
High culture

808
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
.

809
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
My

810
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:16,096
Hatred of them is just super embarrassing like the quintessential example from my life is that

811
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,912
When I was a teenager I hated The Great Gatsby

812
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,192
I thought it was

813
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,496
I wrote a paper that I still have

814
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,776
That I should destroy

815
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
Before I die but

816
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,872
I wrote a paper that I still have

817
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,712
In which I called The Great Gatsby a bunch of Rich Yankees with Yankee

818
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
Key problems I grew up in LA

819
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,528
Contact

820
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,320
End

821
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,624
Like the lack of understanding

822
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,184
In that characterization of The Great Gatsby

823
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,744
Is a reminder that like

824
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,584
One-star Goodreads reviews are not necessarily

825
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,400
Reflective of the quality of a

826
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:56,032
Also like I'm so glad that my high school self did not have access to

827
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,824
Twitter

828
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:02,176
If he had like I would still be living with that and people would be like

829
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,224
Yeah this guy hates The Great Gatsby

830
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,784
And thank you

831
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,832
Making me born in nineteen

832
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
When you see

833
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:17,536
The things you make interacting with the world and the image I have in my mind is

834
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,328
Ant-Man reading

835
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,912
Fault in Our Stars in Bad Company

836
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,984
What are the moment of delight for me

837
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,824
But when you see your things that you make

838
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,152
Interacting with the culture of the world how does it make you feel

839
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,968
When it's things like

840
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,528
Ant Man reading the Fault in Our Stars

841
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
It's

842
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,368
Just like a wonderful delightful unexpected MoMA

843
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,392
And

844
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,696
That one in particular was fun because I was

845
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,720
With my son

846
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,000
In the movie theater

847
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:53,120
And he likes it out loud add that's your book and I was like I don't know

848
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:57,216
Did you know that was going to happen and I was like no how could I have known as.

849
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,520
You know called me to clear it

850
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,872
I would have thought they called you to clear it actually

851
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
They didn't

852
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,200
Or at least if they did they didn't call me that

853
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,016
But to be honest it can get

854
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,296
Overwhelming

855
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,344
I can get a little like

856
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136
Scary somehow

857
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
Yeah I don't know how

858
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
How to say it

859
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,512
Scary remember right when the Fault in Our Stars movie

860
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
Timeout

861
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Because it was

862
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,096
For a few weeks like fairly

863
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,632
Close to the center of

864
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,168
Us pop culture

865
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,752
Like a people were saying things about it that I thought were really

866
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,288
Kind of unfair

867
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,336
In the way that we always

868
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
Are judging

869
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
Popular

870
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,920
Cultural

871
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,944
Phenomena

872
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:45,344
I've always felt like if something becomes very popular there must be something at least a little bit wrong with it

873
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,136
It was weird and uncomfortable

874
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,416
To be in that position

875
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:52,000
But also things like having like a Saturday Night Live sketch or something made out of

876
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
If your works at

877
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,816
Paradies your work I get away it

878
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,096
It's fine and

879
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,400
I thought the sketch that they made was very funny

880
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
But

881
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,520
Yeah it was hard just not to feel really like kind of overwhelmed by it in a little like

882
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,312
Almost an urge to shut down

883
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
You know I don't think it's

884
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,640
It's a coincidence that I didn't write a novel for like 6 years

885
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
After that book came out

886
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,504
I've been interviewed on TV. Only a couple of times a handful of times

887
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,576
And I've never seen any of them I just can't

888
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,600
I don't want to know

889
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,672
I don't want to know if I felt bad about it I don't want to know

890
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:26,816
I just want to know it's hard now I mean you know obviously these are like

891
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,608
Incredibly

892
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
Rarefied

893
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,192
Problems that I am extremely grateful to have

894
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:36,288
You know like I definitely had a moment there where I could have chosen

895
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,568
A path

896
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
That I didn't

897
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,616
Choose

898
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:45,760
Like we could have moved to LA and or New York and and gotten lots of work and there were lots of opportunities in

899
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
What I

900
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,832
Kind of chose to do was to

901
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:54,208
Come back here to Indianapolis IN to work on making crash course our educational video series better and

902
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,744
Winter work on

903
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,792
The stuff that I wanted to work on

904
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,376
That was supposed to lower profile but also that I had more

905
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
Control over

906
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,728
Cuz I think part of what was so disorienting about that experience

907
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
Aunt was

908
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,056
Losing some control over

909
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,336
Both my work

910
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,872
And on some level over

911
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Myself

912
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,968
Service like the way that myself was being portrayed in a magic

913
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,504
I'm really like

914
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,136
Interested in you deciding Tesoro pull back and do crash course and stuff instead of doing punch up on

915
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,976
Some scripture something you know it's not because

916
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,000
Uibe

917
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:32,096
The stain for those things it's just that no not at all know it's kind of like

918
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,632
Well I got my thing

919
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
I need my things break

920
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,520
Can I tell you my favorite joke I'm sure you've heard this joke but you never heard me do it

921
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,544
So

922
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,848
A moth walks into a

923
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:46,944
Microsoft Office do you know this joke I don't I don't know if I don't know it from that set up

924
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
All right

925
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,064
DeNiro a podiatrist office and

926
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,392
The podiatrist that's what seems to be the problem off in the mall says

927
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,672
Doc if only there were

928
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,000
One problem I mean you know my wife

929
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:04,096
Doesn't love me anymore Sasha's that she doesn't love me I don't even remember a time

930
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,376
When she did love me

931
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,704
My daughter has married a man who Midas

932
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
Spies

933
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,520
Who despises me

934
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,104
My son is a wretched failure and to be honest

935
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,200
When I look at him all I see is a reflection of my own failures

936
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,504
I just don't know how to go on dock

937
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
I don't know

938
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
I don't know

939
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
Do you know

940
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,208
And the podiatrist says seems like a very serious problems

941
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,744
I'm a podiatrist

942
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,536
What brought you here today

943
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
And the moth says

944
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,352
Show the light was on

945
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,240
I love that joke

946
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,544
Because like the joke

947
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:49,408
Is that mobs are stupid and they just go where the light is on

948
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,528
But the other thing about the joke is that

949
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,320
Almost all the time

950
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,416
Humans also just go where the lights on

951
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,720
And so

952
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,768
I really love

953
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:11,680
Moments where humans don't go where the light is on and I really try and my own life thinking hard about

954
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:16,288
You know am I doing this because I want to do it or am I doing this because the light is on

955
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,920
So how would you rate our conversation on a 5-star scale

956
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,456
I mean from my side

957
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,040
4 and a half stars but I'm more worried about how you would rate it now I'm nervous

958
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,088
I could be getting in the moment but

959
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,624
I'm thinking Solid 5 stars

960
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
I don't mean to be

961
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,720
What are those Amazon reviews that you're skeptical of fight

962
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,000
Wheel of Life

963
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
It's been great.

964
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:52,640
After the break John Green reviews the Piggly Wiggly

965
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:57,247
And he just lays into the penny honestly is the angriest I've ever heard him

966
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,039
More anthropocene reviewed

967
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
After this

968
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,583
Here again is the anthropocene reviewed

969
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
99 percent invisible

970
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,447
Hello and welcome to the anthropocene reviewed

971
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,751
The podcast where we review different facets

972
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,311
It's a human centered planet on a five-star scale

973
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,895
My name is John Green and today I'll be reviewing pennies

974
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,967
Distensible form of currency here in the United States

975
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,527
And the grocery store chain Piggly Wiggly

976
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,023
Let's begin with the American penny

977
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:46,655
Which is worth 1/100 of the US dollar and is almost as old as the nation itself

978
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,983
The first US penny was minted in 1793

979
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,775
It was made of copper

980
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,055
Wait about half an ounce

981
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,639
And with the size of a contemporary $1 coin

982
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,967
Which come to think of it is a useless comparison

983
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:05,087
Since nobody uses one dollar coins even though their adoption would save the United States hundred

984
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
Millions of dollars per year

985
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,207
But we're not here to review the two star $1 bill

986
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,743
We're here to review the penny

987
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,327
Which since 1909 has featured the profiled face

988
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,631
Have US President Abraham Lincoln

989
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:22,239
The penny was actually the first US money to be stamped with a president's face

990
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:28,127
Many of the u.s. is Founders including George Washington felt it would be to Monarca Colton

991
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,919
Coins featuring us leaders

992
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:36,575
In fact the u.s. mint Act of 1792 explicitly stated that one side of copper coins

993
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
Should State the denomination

994
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,159
And the other side should have a quote

995
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,463
Impression emblematic of Liberty

996
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:48,095
Today's pennies weigh about a fifth of what the eighteenth-century ones did

997
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,399
And while they're still coated in Copper

998
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,215
Pennies are now over 97% zinc

999
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,495
Which is cheaper than

1000
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
10 copper

1001
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,799
But even so

1002
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,871
Every $0.01 coin minted in the United States

1003
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:03,455
Cost 1.82 cents to create

1004
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,271
Last year the US Mint lost

1005
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,831
69 million dollars

1006
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,855
Minting pennies

1007
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,671
That would be annoying but forgivable

1008
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,975
Is penne served a purpose in our economy

1009
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,999
But they don't

1010
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:20,607
Money is supposed to facilitate the exchange of goods and services which

1011
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,143
Penny's manifestly

1012
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,423
Failed to do

1013
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,751
You can't use them in vending machines are parking meters

1014
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:32,127
And if you attempt to use them to purchase goods or services you will often be met with resistance

1015
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:37,503
And for good reason I mean it requires over 2 lb of pennies around a kilogram

1016
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,063
To purchase a single gallon of gasoline

1017
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
And yet every year

1018
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:46,207
The US Mint makes more pennies than all other coins combined

1019
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,279
Not because we use them so often to buy thing

1020
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,327
But because we don't use

1021
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:56,959
We store them in jars or leave them in the terrifying Netherworld of our cars

1022
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,983
Center console

1023
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,543
And we throw them away by the million

1024
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,079
Because panties

1025
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,871
Do not work as

1026
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,639
Currency

1027
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:09,759
There are many arguments in favor of the continued production of the penny

1028
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,063
I just don't find any of them convincing

1029
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:16,671
Some argue for instance that in a penniless World prices might go up

1030
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,743
And that those price increases would disproportionately affect

1031
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,791
The poor who are more likely to use

1032
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
Cash in transaction

1033
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:27,423
But in fact eliminating the penny would not increase prices

1034
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:33,311
We know this because many nations have already retired their Penny equivalent without any problem

1035
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,359
From the Netherlands to New Zealand

1036
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,711
We would simply begin rounding prices to the nearest tenth of a dollar

1037
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,759
Instead of the nearest hundredth of a dollar

1038
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:46,111
Assuming we had the common sense to also eliminate are $0.05 coins

1039
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,135
Each of which cost

1040
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,159
Point to send

1041
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
Instrument

1042
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:53,023
If anything this system would benefit those who use cash

1043
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,583
Because they would spend the same amount of money

1044
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
But no longer have

1045
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
To deal with pennies

1046
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,703
Which are so easy to receive as change

1047
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
And so difficult

1048
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
To spend

1049
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:09,407
People often resort to cashing out their small denomination coins by a coin counting machines like Coinstar

1050
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,967
Which charge an astonishing 12

1051
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
Percent fee

1052
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:16,063
For the privilege of turning your pennies and nickels

1053
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,367
In the money you can actually spend

1054
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,159
Other defense

1055
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:24,767
Size of the penny that it honors Lincoln or that it's somehow limits inflation

1056
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,047
Are just absurd

1057
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,935
None of the countries that have eliminated one cent coins have seen a corresponding rise in inflation

1058
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:38,335
And why would Abraham Lincoln want to be the face of a coin that is worth -69 million

1059
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
Dollars per year

1060
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,407
The whole thing is ridiculous

1061
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,711
But then again

1062
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:48,063
Righteous indignation at the ongoing existence of the penny

1063
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,343
Is also

1064
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:56,255
69 million dollars represents a tiny fraction of the US federal budget

1065
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:00,351
Like we spend about 68 million dollars on the military

1066
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
Per hour

1067
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,447
We have much bigger problems than the penny

1068
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:10,079
The United States is one of the only Nations that have seen life expectancy decline in the past 2 years

1069
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:13,663
Despite the fact that we spend more on Healthcare than any other country

1070
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:19,295
Are massive economic inequality is inhibiting economic growth and limiting opportunity

1071
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,575
Our political system

1072
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:24,159
Atoms are far too profoundly influenced by moneyed interests

1073
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,207
And eliminating the penny

1074
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
Will fix none of them

1075
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,327
But our failure to bid farewell to the penny

1076
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,911
Seems to me indicative of a larger political fail

1077
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,215
We cannot accomplish

1078
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,263
Simple and obvious things

1079
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,591
Because there is nothing to be gained politically

1080
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,871
By accomplishing

1081
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:49,503
Almost all of our political discourse is focused on issues that can score points

1082
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,783
And energized

1083
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551
Supporters

1084
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:56,415
Should the Supreme Court nominee be approved as an issue that can drive donations

1085
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,463
Should the penny be eliminated

1086
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
Is not

1087
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,303
In part because it's not very important

1088
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,119
And in part because it's not very device

1089
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:11,263
There is of course nothing surprising about the fact that Congress can't find the political will to eliminate

1090
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
Penny's I mean

1091
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,823
If Congress were drowning

1092
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,151
Struggle to pass the throw Congress something that floats at

1093
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,991
The US political system is complex by Design

1094
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,063
Change is supposed to be difficult to enact

1095
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,879
But I'm not convinced it should be this.

1096
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,439
In 1857

1097
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:32,255
The United States was only a few years away from a civil war

1098
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,815
I know 160 years ago

1099
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,351
Seems like ancient history

1100
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
But consider this

1101
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,935
Two of the grandfathers

1102
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,471
Of my grandfather's

1103
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,007
Fought in that war

1104
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
On office

1105
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
Besides

1106
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,359
I know history can feel settle

1107
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,895
But we

1108
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,687
The results of History

1109
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,479
Or anything but settled

1110
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,527
So right it's 18

1111
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
57

1112
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:01,439
Political divisions over slavery are such that a year earlier and abolitionist Senator named Charles Sumner

1113
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,999
Had been beaten with a cane nearly two

1114
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,767
To death

1115
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,071
In the chamber of the United States Senate

1116
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,375
Buy a pro-slavery Congressman name

1117
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
Preston Brooks

1118
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,935
Go by the way

1119
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,983
Would go on to be re-elected by his

1120
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:14,751
Constituents

1121
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,799
And yet even then

1122
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:21,151
Is the house divided against itself with learning but it could not stand

1123
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,455
The United States Congress passed

1124
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,271
The coinage act of 1857 into law

1125
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,063
Among other things

1126
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,367
The ACT eliminated the halfpenny

1127
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,439
Which has become too small a monetary sum

1128
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
To be worth minting

1129
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,999
At the time

1130
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,559
The halfpenny was worth about $0.12

1131
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,583
In today's money

1132
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,655
Tumi the ongoing existence of

1133
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,471
The penny symbolizes not only our inability

1134
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,007
Need to find common ground

1135
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,383
But also our inability to acknowledge the places where Common Ground already

1136
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,151
Exists

1137
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,431
In fact

1138
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:58,271
I think the only vaguely convincing case one can make for the penny

1139
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,063
Is that as a nation

1140
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
We all share it

1141
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,135
No matter where you're from

1142
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,695
Or what news Outlet you rely upon

1143
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,511
No matter your age or race or gender

1144
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,047
We can all agree

1145
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,863
That the continued minting of the American penny

1146
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,423
Is an absolute abomination

1147
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,751
Maybe it's worth 69 million dollars a year

1148
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,567
To have something that we can all dislike together

1149
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,895
And anywhere there is something kind of American

1150
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,687
About putting our best president

1151
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
On our worst

1152
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Bitcoin

1153
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,271
I give the penny 1 and 1/2 Stars

1154
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
In 1920

1155
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:44,351
My maternal grandmother's father was working at a grocery store

1156
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,655
In a Tiny Town in Western Tennessee

1157
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,703
Like all us grocery stores

1158
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,239
Is the beginning of the 20th century

1159
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,775
This one was full service

1160
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,847
You walked in with a list of items you needed

1161
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,383
And then the grocer

1162
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
Perhaps my great-grandfather

1163
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,455
We Gather those eyes

1164
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:04,063
Midway to flour or cornmeal or butter or tomatoes

1165
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,855
Wrap everything up for you

1166
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,647
And then charge it to your account

1167
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,487
You'd rather wait for the clerk to finish your shopping for you

1168
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:15,583
Or for a small fee you'd have your order delivered to your house later in the day

1169
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,631
Like almost all grocery stores

1170
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,959
The time my great-grandfather store also allowed customers

1171
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,495
To purchase food on credit

1172
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,287
Which the customer would then

1173
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,055
Usually

1174
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
Payback over

1175
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,591
4 time

1176
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:30,175
That's where it was supposed to be my great-grandfather's ticket out of

1177
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
Poverty

1178
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,735
But it didn't work out that way

1179
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,039
Instead the store closed

1180
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:40,415
Thanks in part to the self-service grocery Revolution launched by Clarence Saunders

1181
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,975
Saunders with the self-educated child

1182
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,255
Impoverished sharecropper

1183
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,815
Eventually found his way to the grocery business

1184
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,095
In Memphis Tennessee

1185
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,703
He was 35 when he developed the concept for a grocery store

1186
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,751
It would have no clerks or counters

1187
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,055
But instead of Labyrinth of Isles

1188
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,103
The customers would walk themselves

1189
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,151
Choosing their own food

1190
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,455
And placing it in their own shopping.

1191
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:11,391
Prices at Saunders self-service grocery would be lower because his stores would employ fewer clerks and also because

1192
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,183
Is he wouldn't offer customers credit

1193
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,207
But instead

1194
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,487
Expect immediate payment

1195
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,815
The prices would also be clear and transparent

1196
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:23,423
For the first time every item in a grocery store would be marked with a price

1197
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:26,495
So customers would no longer fear being overcharged

1198
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,519
By unscrupulous

1199
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
What's Grocers

1200
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,847
Sandra's called his grocery store

1201
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,127
Piggly Wiggly

1202
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,431
Why

1203
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,967
Nobody knows

1204
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,759
When asked where the name came from

1205
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,807
Saunders once answered that it arrived

1206
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,111
From out of chaos and indirect

1207
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,415
Contact with an individual's mind

1208
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,231
Which gives you a sense of the kind of guy he was

1209
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:52,351
But usually when he was asked why anyone would call a grocery store Piggly Wiggly

1210
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,631
He would answer

1211
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,935
So people will ask that very question

1212
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,543
The first Piggly Wiggly opened in Memphis in 1916

1213
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:04,383
It was so successful that the second Piggly Wiggly opened

1214
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,919
3 weeks later

1215
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,223
2 months after that another open

1216
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,271
Sandra's insisted on calling it

1217
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,063
Piggly Wiggly the Third

1218
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,111
Who win who stores the quote

1219
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,159
Royal dignity they are due

1220
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,719
He soon began attaching a catchphrase

1221
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,999
Storefront signs

1222
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,279
Piggly Wiggly

1223
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,815
All around the world

1224
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,423
Of course at the time the stores were barely all around Memphis

1225
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:31,007
But Sandra's business did grow phenomenally quickly

1226
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:35,359
Within a year there were 353 Piggly Wiggly

1227
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,639
Around the United States

1228
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,967
In newspaper advertisements

1229
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:42,527
Saunders wrote if his self service concept

1230
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,831
In nearly Messianic terms

1231
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,367
One day

1232
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,903
Memphis-shelby proud

1233
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Piggly Wiggly

1234
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,951
When a dread

1235
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,511
And it shall be said by all men

1236
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,351
At the Piggly Wiggly shall multiply and replenish the Earth

1237
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,911
With more and cleaner things to eat

1238
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,215
Another time he wrote

1239
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,287
The mighty pulse of the throbbing today

1240
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,335
Makes new things out of old

1241
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,615
And new things

1242
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,151
Where was nothing before

1243
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,199
Basically

1244
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,247
Saunders spoke of Piggly Wiggly

1245
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,831
As today's Silicon Valley Executives talk of their company

1246
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,879
We're not just making money

1247
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,927
We are replenishing

1248
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,695
The Earth

1249
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:25,535
Piggly Wiggly in the self-service grocery stores that followed

1250
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,815
Did Weller price

1251
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,607
Which meant there was more to eat

1252
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,447
They also change the kinds of foods that were readily available

1253
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,983
To save costs

1254
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,263
Send limit spoilage

1255
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,567
Piggly Wiggly stock less fresh produce

1256
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,591
Traditional grocer

1257
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
Prepackaged

1258
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,919
Processed foods

1259
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,199
Became more popular

1260
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,479
And less expensive

1261
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,527
Which altered American diet

1262
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:50,367
Brand recognition also became extremely important

1263
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:53,695
Because food companies had to appeal directly to Shoppers

1264
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:59,583
Which way to the growth of consumer-oriented food advertising on radio and the newspapers

1265
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,679
A phenomenon that Saunders understood better than almost anyone

1266
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:06,751
During the late nineteen teens and early twenties

1267
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:11,103
Piggly Wiggly was the single largest newspaper Advertiser in the United

1268
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,943
Of course lower prices and fewer Clerks

1269
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,271
Also meant that many people lost their jobs

1270
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,319
Including my great-grandfather

1271
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:25,439
There's nothing new about our fear that Automation and increased efficiency

1272
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,719
Will deprive humans

1273
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,487
Work

1274
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,535
In one newspaper advertisement

1275
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:34,911
Saunders imagined a woman torn between her longtime relationship with her friendly grocer

1276
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,727
And the world will prices of Piggly Wiggly

1277
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:43,359
The story concluded with Saunders appealing to a tradition even older than the full service

1278
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
Chris grosser

1279
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,919
With his protagonist saying

1280
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:50,783
Now way back many years there had been a Dutch grandmother of mine who had been Thrift

1281
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:55,647
The spirit of that old grandmother asserted itself just then Within Me

1282
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,671
And said

1283
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,951
Business is business

1284
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,767
And charity and alms are another

1285
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,327
Whereupon are Shopper Saw the Light

1286
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,119
And converted to Piggly Wiggly

1287
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:10,751
By 1922 there were over a thousand Piggly Wiggly stores around the u.s.

1288
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,823
And shares in the company were listed on the New York Stock

1289
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,151
Saunders was building a 36

1290
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,711
Thousand square foot mansion in Memphis

1291
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:22,783
And headed out the school now known as Rhodes College

1292
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,087
But the good times would not last

1293
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,671
After a few Piggly Wiggly stores in the Northeast failed

1294
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,975
Investors began shorting the stock

1295
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,535
Betting that it's price would fall

1296
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:38,399
Saunders responded by trying to buy up all the available shares of Piggly Wiggly

1297
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,679
Using borrowed money

1298
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:42,239
But the Gambit failed spectacularly

1299
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,031
And Saunders lost control

1300
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,055
Piggly Wiggly

1301
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,079
And went bankrupt

1302
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,407
His betrayal at Wall Street short sellers

1303
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:55,807
Presaged contemporary corporate Titans just as his Reliance on big advertising and Hyper efficiency did

1304
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,623
Saunders with my many accounts of bully

1305
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,159
Verbally abusive

1306
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,439
Cruel

1307
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:04,255
And profoundly convinced of his own genius

1308
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,583
After losing control of the company he wrote

1309
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:12,191
They have it all everything I built the greatest stores of their kind in the world

1310
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,519
But they didn't get the man that was father to the idea

1311
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,335
They have the body of Piggly Wiggly

1312
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,615
But they didn't get

1313
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,383
The soul

1314
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:24,479
Sounders quickly developed A New Concept for a grocery store

1315
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,039
This one would have Isles and self service

1316
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,319
But also Clerk

1317
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,367
In the meat department in the bakery

1318
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,183
Basically a contemporary supermarket

1319
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,999
In under a year he was ready to open

1320
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,071
But the new owners of Piggly Wiggly took him to court

1321
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:42,399
Arguing that the use of the Clarence Saunders name

1322
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,703
In relation to a new grocery store

1323
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,263
Would violate Piggly Wiggly's trademark

1324
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,287
In patent

1325
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,079
In response

1326
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:53,407
Saunders defiantly named his new grocery store

1327
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:57,247
The Clarence Saunders sole owner of my name store

1328
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:01,087
Perhaps the only business name worse than Piggly Wiggly

1329
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,623
And yet

1330
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,183
It succeeded tremendously

1331
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:09,535
And Saunders made a second Fortune as sole owner stores

1332
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,559
Spread throughout the

1333
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:15,167
He went on to invest in a professional football team in Memphis

1334
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:19,263
Which he named the Clarence Saunders sole owner of my name

1335
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,287
Tigers

1336
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,311
Really

1337
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,359
They played the Green Bay Packers

1338
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:26,687
And the Chicago Bears in front of huge crowds in Memphis

1339
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,247
And they were invited to join the NFL

1340
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,807
But Saunders declined

1341
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,599
Because you didn't want to share Revenue

1342
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,391
Or send his team to away game

1343
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:40,767
He promised to build the stadium for the Tigers that would seat over 30000 people

1344
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,559
The stadium he wrote

1345
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,863
Will have skull and crossbones

1346
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,167
For my enemies who I have slain

1347
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,215
But within a few years

1348
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:52,031
The co-owner stories were crushed by the depression

1349
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,079
Football team with out of business

1350
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,871
And he was broke again

1351
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,711
Meanwhile thesaurus body of Piggly Wiggly

1352
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,271
Was faring quite well without Saunders

1353
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,855
By the supermarket chains height in 1932

1354
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:09,439
There were over 2500 Piggly Wiggly's in the United States

1355
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,999
Are even today there are over 600

1356
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,535
Mostly in the south

1357
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,839
Although like many grocery stores

1358
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,911
Is there struggling under pressure from the likes of Walmart

1359
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,191
And Dollar General

1360
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:23,519
Which can undercut traditional grocery stores on price

1361
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,591
Partly by providing even West fresh food

1362
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,871
And fewer Clerks

1363
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,919
And today is Piggly Wiggly's to

1364
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:34,015
These days Piggly Wiggly ads tend to focus on tradition

1365
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,295
And the human touch

1366
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:39,391
1 North Alabama Piggly Wiggly TV spot from 1999

1367
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,671
Included this line

1368
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,463
At Piggly Wiggly

1369
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,999
It's all about friends

1370
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
Serving friend

1371
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,863
A call to the kind of human-to-human relationship

1372
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,935
What's that Saunders ridiculed in that Dutch grandmother ad

1373
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:55,007
The mighty pulse of the throbbing today

1374
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:57,055
Does make new things out of old

1375
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,615
But it also makes old things

1376
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,639
Out of new

1377
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:06,783
Today food prices are lower relative to average wage than they've ever been in the United

1378
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,551
United States

1379
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,087
But our diets are often

1380
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:09,855
Rapport

1381
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:13,695
The average American ingests more sugar and sodium than they should

1382
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,231
Largely because of

1383
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:15,999
The process

1384
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,279
Pre-packaged Foods

1385
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,839
As for Clarence Saunders

1386
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:24,447
He spent decades after his second bankruptcy trying to launch a New Concept

1387
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,983
Call Becky duzel

1388
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,031
I totally automated store

1389
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:31,103
That looks like a massive Bank of vending machines

1390
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,455
And involves purchasing food with almost no human to human interaction

1391
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,879
He was also one of the first business people to spend private money on newspaper advertising for political can

1392
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,415
Running ads

1393
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,719
Including virulently racist ones

1394
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,767
For his preferred gubernatorial can

1395
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:53,631
Saunders grew more vitriolic and unpredictable as he aged

1396
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,935
You could never get the key duzel to work

1397
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:58,495
The Machinery broke down constantly

1398
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:01,055
And people found the shopping experience

1399
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,335
Slow and clunky

1400
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,407
He eventually entered a Sanitarium.

1401
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,711
The treated people with anxiety and depression

1402
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,503
The mansion

1403
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,551
Saunders built with his first Fortune

1404
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,599
Became the Pink Palace Museum

1405
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:16,159
Memphis is science and history museum

1406
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,231
The estate he built with his second Fortune

1407
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,279
Peking lichterman Nature Center

1408
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:24,863
In 1936 there journalist Ernie Pyle said

1409
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,655
If Sandra's lives long enough

1410
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,191
Memphis will become the most

1411
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,727
Beautiful city in the world

1412
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,031
Just with the thing Saunders built

1413
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,055
And wasp

1414
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,615
But Saunders never made a third for

1415
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,431
He died at the Walla Sanitarium

1416
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,711
In 1953

1417
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,503
At the age of 72

1418
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,063
When obituary opined

1419
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,623
Some men achieve lasting Fame

1420
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,391
Through success

1421
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,951
Others achieve it through failure

1422
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,255
Saunders was a huckster

1423
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,303
He committed Securities fraud

1424
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:57,119
He helped Usher in an era of food

1425
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,911
It feels without nourishing

1426
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,215
He was also a genius

1427
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,239
Ahead of his time

1428
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
Who understood

1429
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:03,775
To the power

1430
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,567
Branding and efficient

1431
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,871
But mostly

1432
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,663
When I think of Piggly Wiggly

1433
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:13,503
I think if it's swallowing up the small town grocery stores

1434
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,807
Only to be swallowed itself

1435
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
By the likes of Walmart

1436
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,647
Which will in turn

1437
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,671
Be swallowed

1438
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,951
By the likes of Amazon

1439
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,047
Joyce called Ireland the south at heater pharaoh

1440
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:29,375
But Ireland has nothing on American capitalism

1441
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,935
I get Piggly Wiggly two and a half
