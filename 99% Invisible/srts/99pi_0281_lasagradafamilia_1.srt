The Mind enter Barcelona's most famous Cathedral often stretches around the block

25
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
La Sagrada Familia

26
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
Designed by Antoni Gaudi draw so many people to see at the neighborhood is congested with tour buses and

27
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
Taxis in scooters

28
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
3 million people went inside the church in 2016 and another 7 million came just to stare at the outside

29
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
Estranged Behemoth structure

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,656
If you travel around Spain you'll see a lot

31
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,448
Old Gothic churches

32
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,008
Razor Katie mingle was in Spain

33
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
Earlier this year

34
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
But this one is different

35
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,152
First it doesn't look like a Gothic Cathedral

36
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,456
It looks like it was built out of Bones

37
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
Are saying

38
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
Or like it just

39
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
World out of the sea

40
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
Fractal

41
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
It looks organic somehow

42
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,232
But there's another thing that sets it apart from your average old Gothic

43
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
Cathedral

44
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,304
It isn't actually old

45
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,168
LD wasn't able to build very much of it before he died in 1926

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,240
Most of the church has been built in the last 40 years

47
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
And it still isn't finished

48
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:25,152
Which means that Architects have had to figure out and still are figuring out

49
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,712
How gow do you wanted the church to be built

50
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,064
We are all together in that room is

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
The special room

52
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
The most important part of the

53
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,672
Building we are building

54
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,304
That's heronema Boucher Rio one of the current architects of the building

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,936
He says the clues to understanding how to move forward on the construction of La Sagrada Familia

56
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
Are kept in the room were standing in right now

57
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
In the basement of the church

58
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
Photosynthesis radio can you describe

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
What's in this area

60
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
Now look up shelves

61
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
With

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
Fragments

63
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
Little pieces of

64
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Plaster

65
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Beeg

66
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Small

67
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:15,840
Boy died geldi left elaborate plaster model of detailing his plans for finishing the church

68
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
But about 80 years ago

69
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
They're all basically destroyed

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
Nether in pieces

71
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
If it doesn't look like

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,568
Just from this and those little pieces that that would be enough

73
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
The lake

74
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Figure out

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
The whole

76
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Sing

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,712
I understand that it's difficult

78
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,296
To know what we have to do if the main architect is not

79
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Cartier

80
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,904
Highest us what we try to do is to understand

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
How

82
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
He thought

83
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
And it's not easy

84
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
I know

85
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,376
It definitely hasn't been easy for the new architects

86
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,216
Recreate an understand the vision of Antoni Gaudi

87
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
And there are people who think

88
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
They shouldn't even have tried

89
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
But the building should have stopped

90
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
Took Audi's.

91
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
But it didn't

92
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,272
The building is currently the longest running construction project in the world

93
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,368
And The Architects are still trying to understand the mind

94
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
Gaudi

95
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,024
Antoni Gaudi grew up in a little town called where you

96
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Which like Barcelona

97
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,119
Part of the reason Spain called Catalonia

98
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
And although he's become one of Spain's most famous

99
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,519
Yode would never have identified as Spanish

100
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
He was Catalonia

101
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
Through and through

102
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:35,455
Catalonia has been in the news recently because of its movement for independence from Spain

103
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,527
But in many ways this movement isn't new

104
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Catalonians

105
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,367
Struggled against the rule of the Spanish for centuries

106
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,183
Castlevania has a separate language Castle

107
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
It is always felt very separate

108
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,047
That guy spends Bergen

109
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,887
This guy spent hens burden I'm the biographer of Antoni Gaudi

110
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:00,287
Pennsburg and says that as a child growing up in Catalonia Gowdy spent a lot of time outside

111
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,431
And was completely enthralled with the natural world around him

112
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,503
A lot of kids are curious about nature

113
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
Antoni Gaudi

114
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
It was different

115
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,367
It became a total obsession

116
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,975
He seemed to absorb essential lessons from the patterns and shapes

117
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
He saw in nature

118
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
Just looking at the way the insect

119
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:26,655
12 walking and flowers grew the way that A Tree Grows in

120

SquareTrade

121
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Brooches

122
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
A dried-out snake skeleton

123
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Honeycomb

124
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,335
These were Nature's perfect instructions

125
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,151
Pittsburgh Aldi a deeply religious Catholic

126
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,455
God was the master architect

127
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,759
Of these Wallace organic structures

128
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
Eventually God he left

129
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:49,695
A small town in the countryside and moved to Barcelona for University and then Arkansas

130
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
High School

131
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,327
When he graduated in 1878 the director of the school said

132
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,655
We are here today either in the presence of a genius

133
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
Or a Madman

134
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,519
Gaudi began his career at a difficult moment in Barcelona

135
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,639
Industrial Revolution and brought thousands of workers from the countryside into the city for factory jobs

136
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,943
They were toiling in terrible condition

137
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,271
Packed into filthy tenements drinking dirty water

138
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,087
Diseases like yellow fever in Colorado

139
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
We're ramping

140
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,511
In the midst of all of this suffering a Bookseller name shows up book of Isaiah begins selling a fundamentalist news

141
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Paper

142
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:29,631
The kind of reminded everyone that their misery was punishment for their sins

143
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
Surprisingly a cool song

144
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
Pretty soon broke up with making quite a lot of money from his Catholic guilt seemed newspaper

145
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,919
Kept apparently on the hidden under the tiles of his book shop

146
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,551
With the piles of money he was accumulating decided to build a church

147
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,647
Women to inspire the common folk to lead a religious life

148
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,231
The church will be dedicated to Mary Joseph and Jesus

149
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,559
The sacred family La Sagrada Familia

150
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,887
The first architect at Build-A-Bear hired quit after a year

151
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
He went looking for a new one

152
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:09,823
Legend goes book of Isaiah had a dream one night blue eyes man would come to the rescue

153
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,943
The very next day book of Isaiah saw the person from his dream in real life

154
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,271
Drawing in the studio of another architect Inu

155
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
Ginger hair blue eyes

156
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,879
And he says what are you older man

157
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,207
The man he had seen was Antoni Gaudi

158
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,279
And immediately boccabella hired him to be the architect

159
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Act of his church

160
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
The

161
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
Grace is Joven Spain

162
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
At that time

163
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
Was given to this completely

164
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,007
Lumos completely online 29 year olds nude

165
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
Done

166
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Very little work

167
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,127
The basic floor plan for La Sagrada Familia

168
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,431
Had already been laid out by the former architect

169
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
And Goldie would stick with it

170
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,575
The church will be built in the Neo Gothic style Which is popular at the time in Europe

171
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,671
Miguel D also wanted to charge to be something completely unique

172
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
Inspired by Nature

173
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
And by God

174
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,327
What county wanted was a building which would actually have the kind of

175
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Harmonies

176
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,447
All of the celestial spheres the idea of did everything

177
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
As a home mini in nature

178
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
And if you got that right in your building

179
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
The building itself with spirituality

180
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:21,503
That said Gowdy would never allow the building to outshine God's creations

181
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,087
So he set a limit on how tall the church would ever get

182
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,439
He felt that he didn't want to be taller than God's handiwork and God's handiwork

183
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
We're close to mountains

184
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
Only the side

185
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,095
La Sagrada Familia would be one or about 3 ft

186
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,911
Shorter than Mount montjuic in Barcelona

187
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
Majestic keep it humble

188
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:47,359
In 1883 when Gaudi started work on La Sagrada Familia is first matter of business was to finish the

189
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,175
The Crypt which has been started by the previous architect

190
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,807
The Crypt is essentially a small church under the bigger charge and a place where important

191
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
People are buried

192
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,695
In fact I was buried there when he died in 1892

193
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,999
9 years after he hired Gowdy

194
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,607
Sagrada Familia Crypt was big enough to hold services in

195
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,447
And this kept everyone happy while Gowdy took his time designing the rest of the building

196
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,799
The book of Isaiah died management of the construction passed through various hands

197
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
Purple Galaxy

198
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
It was only one client

199
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
That really mattered

200
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
God is the client and God is never in a hurry

201
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,247
After the Crypt was finished

202
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,831
Scoutee began to build the first big wall of the building

203
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
The Nativity Feast

204
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,671
He would work on it for the rest of his life

205
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,999
It was important to him that this facade get done first

206
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,327
Because it would be the Bible written in stone

207
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Which

208
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,447
People if they couldn't even read or write they could look at the building and btools about

209
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
The values of the castle

210
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Slick face

211
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
LD was a sculptor as much as an architect

212
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:53,407
In the wall would be full of stone sculptures depicting biblical seeds

213
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
The baptism of Christ

214
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,527
Christ in the workshop with his father flight to Egypt

215
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
With a life-size donkey

216
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:06,463
The stone sculpture of a donkey in that c was actually cast in plaster

217
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,815
I'm a real live donkey

218
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,887
It looked as if it had been through the desert for 40 days

219
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,775
One of these workers actually wandered the streets until he found the perfect starving donkey

220
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,591
Which he exactly hand it over to God

221
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,431
Each of the Donkey

222
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,783
And he Costco

223
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:37,439
Antoni Gaudi also tried making plaster molds from live human beings

224
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,255
One of his workers but they almost killed him and

225
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:46,655
I decided that maybe that wasn't the best way forward

226
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,823
This all took an incredibly long time but eventually the wall started to tell us a story in stone

227
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,431
And it featured hundreds of celestial and Earthly creatures

228
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,015
Little snails crawling all over ads and tortoises

229
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,367
The facade became crowded and cluttered and teeming with life

230
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
Lumos

231
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
Swamp fish

232
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,255
Tell the quality of the stain oozing out of organic

233
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,071
Shaping of the building it was very unusual

234
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,375
Varick Street

235
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,751
Antoni Gaudi was slowly building a Catholic Church

236
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:29,151
But not everyone was convinced the Catholicism have anything of value to offer the average working citizen

237
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,503
Leftists are the church is getting rich from the tithes of the poor

238
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,831
They sold them as being wealthy is being parasitic

239
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
As living off them

240
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:43,743
Communism socialism and anarchism we're taking hold in other parts of the world and in Spain

241
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,327
He left his parties thought they could offer the struggling worker a better life

242
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:51,935
Conflict between leftist in the state and left us and the church or a consonant

243
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
For the Lost

244
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,263
Decades of the nineteenth century

245
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,335
It's probably on the average something like two bones every week

246
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
In the center of the city

247
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,479
Brother years Gaudi worked on other architecture projects in Barcelona

248
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,039
His work is Peppers all over the city

249
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,367
Impalas is Pavilions and extracting homes

250
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,951
His sinuous in skeletal architecture was unmistakable

251
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,255
Everyone in Barcelona new hairstyle

252
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
But La Sagrada Familia

253
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,095
It's a project that consumed him

254
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,447
He realize the coast he could never finish it in would never see it finished in his lifetime

255
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
My 1926

256
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,847
73 year old Antoni Gaudi had never married and was living alone

257
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,455
He spent a lot of nights sleeping in his Studio at La Sagrada Familia

258
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
Too obsessed with his work

259
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
To care about his appearance

260
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
He was

261
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,623
Looking up it's like a tramp actually busy

262
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,463
Travis is what held up with safety pins in a bit of string

263
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,303
On June 7th of 1926

264
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
Gowdy is leaving work

265
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,143
And as he crosses the railroad tracks

266
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
He forgets to look

267
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,823
And the Tramp Runza maeva Antoni Gaudi was left nearly dead on the railroad

268
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,687
His body was found he was taken to the hospital where he died three days later

269
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
LD was buried in the Crypt

270
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
Under La Sagrada Familia

271
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,879
His last years have been consumed with building the church

272
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,951
The Barcelona have not forgotten Gaudi

273
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:23,583
Drawings of people came out to mourn population

274
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,911
Castlevania turned up in recession

275
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,959
Thousands of people that

276
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,335
When Gaudi died he left behind a largely unfinished Church

277
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
What stood was a massive war

278
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
The Nativity facade

279
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
One Tower

280
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
And the crap

281
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
His colleagues and apprentices

282
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,343
We have a lot to do to bring his full vision into being

283
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,951
Look out he had anticipated that other Architects would finish his work

284
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:55,839
And he left behind detailed drawings and models outlining exactly how he wanted his magnum opus

285
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
To be built

286
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,751
For 10 years work unless grata Familia continued very slowly

287
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,895
Much of Gabby's former team stayed on even though they could have gone and started their own projects

288
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
They were loyal

289
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,223
There was still work to be done

290
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
The jewel ring still existed

291
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,575
They continued working away

292
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:23,487
And then in 1936

293
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:28,863
The Spanish Civil War

294
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,887
Began

295
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
The decades-old conflict between leftist in the state and finally come to a head

296
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:41,663
The Republicans who were in Alliance of various leftist parties

297
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
Fought against the Nationalist

298
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,271
Which was the lines of fascists and other conservatives

299
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,319
Led by General Francisco Franco

300
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,415
The nationalists also have the support of most of Spain's Catholic clergy

301
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,719
On the 18th of July two days off

302
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,047
Start the Spanish Civil War a group of young anarchists

303
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,911
Breaking to the Stooges of Goldie and smash everything with hammers

304
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,495
All the multiples everything is smashed up into tiny little bit

305
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,823
When they're done smashing daylight the place Ablaze

306
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,407
Everything Burns including the architectural drawings

307
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
Absolutely everything in fact

308
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735
The following day

309
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,063
Trying to come back and bum the Nativity facade

310
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,879
Which is the only one standing there with Gowdy's

311
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
Which

312
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
Miraculously they failed to do

313
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,535
Catholicism was under attack during the war

314
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
And by the end of it

315
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,375
40 churches in Barcelona had been destroyed

316
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,519
And 12 people associated with the Sagrada Familia project including some bits managing patrons and clergy

317
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Have been killed

318
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,479
The war ended in 1939

319
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Alexis Maas

320
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,111
The fastest 1 and general Francisco Franco took control of Spain

321
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,927
Should I use eco

322
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
What is all over

323
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,559
Few workers return to gaudi's Studio to salvage what they could

324
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
They very carefully

325
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
Picked up in boxes little

326
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,959
Sections and fragments of of the multiples

327
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,799
Unlike archaeologists do today they started piecing them together

328
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:19,199
For the next couple of decades the remaining Architects and other workers tried to figure out how to move forward on the

329
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
Suction without Gowdy's plans

330
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,599
But outside the church there was opposition to moving forward at all

331
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,183
In the 1960s an impressive group of intellectuals in Arkansas

332
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:35,583
Sex including Le corbusier and Alvaro Alto Road and open letter opposing the continuation of La Sagrada Familia

333
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
Amelia

334
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
LD wasn't only in Arkansas

335
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Back they argued

336
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
He was an artist

337
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,031
And you shouldn't attempt to finish a work of art without the artist

338
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
They felt good

339
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,871
This was a total waste of time they should have left

340
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
Just the original Nativity facade

341
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,479
Almost like a Gothic ruins

342
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,783
That is a homage to Gaudi

343
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,343
And the Gaudi wasn't being well-served

344
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
But the patrons of the project would have none of it

345
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,767
The building was never supposed to be an homage to Gaudi they argued

346
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,095
It was always about something bigger

347
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:14,495
That said they would try to honor Gowdy's original Vision as Faithfully as possible but it would be easy

348
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:20,895
The models and drawings had been the roadmap for how to move forward on the construction and they were burned and smashed.

349
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Pieces

350
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,479
And this wasn't just any Cathedral

351
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759

So complex and so completely new

355
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
It would taste his successors

356
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,023
Years to fully get a handle on it

357
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
The church still had no interior

358
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
In the roof

359
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
It was just walls and Towers

360

00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
But I was 20

365
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
That's architect Mark burry

366
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:02,879
Mark actually been told an architecture school that Gowdy was not worth studying because his approach was to

367
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
Esoteric

368
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
That he was sad

369
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,511
Two extraordinary and that there was no school

370
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
Meaning that there was

371
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:16,191
Nothing to say you move alone this just got blurry more curious

372
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,519
So he went to have a look at the Sagrada Familia himself

373
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,151
Add by complete accident X not meeting the 290 year-old actex

374
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
Directions to project

375
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,503
And had died

376
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,343
They have been young Architects listing the guy with the expanding his latest discoveries

377
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
When they were students

378
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,743
The old Architects were ready to move on to the interior of the building

379
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,863
But they didn't exactly know how to do it

380
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,655
Facebook geometry

381
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
Play music system

382
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
Translation to

383
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
I kind of building methodology

384
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,151
In other words The Architects knew it was theoretically

385
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,479
Possible to figure out how to create the rest of the church

386
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
But it was a Monumental task

387
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,599
They pointed burrito couple of boxes

388
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,391
Immortals

389
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
Monster Paris models

390
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,743
Invitation to come and join the team and

391
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
Have a mistress

392
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
Puryear burry work with the model

393
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,983
Trying to extrapolate the geometry of the rest of the church

394
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,775
Based on the pieces he had

395
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
After a year

396
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,359
He managed to draw out architectural blueprints

397
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
For one window

398
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
It was a start

399
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,527
Mark Berry didn't stay long at the Sagrada Familia

400
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,367
He was only 20 and he had to go back to New Zealand finish school

401
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,415
He returned to work on the church

402
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,975
10 years later and found that when he was gone

403
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,047
A news thingamabob have been moved into the office

404
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
Computer

405
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,447
Thought these computers must have something to offer cuz I've never actually personally tax form

406
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,311
Winberry finally touch the computer he figured out that it had architectural software on it

407
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
But the software wasn't capable

408
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,639
Of dealing with Gaudi

409
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,943
Couldn't even go anywhere near what county was

410
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
Trying to do

411
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:09,599
The complexity of gaudi's designs with too much for architectural software of the early 90s

412
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,463
Marie wondered if there was anyone else who designed with similar geometric complexity

413
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
And finally you landed on it

414
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,071
People who design airplanes

415
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,727
He started using aeronautical software to figure out an architectural strategy for the interior of the church

416
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,823
And because I had to spray sophisticated software by accident undiscovered permit

417
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Design

418
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
So we will baking powder mix

419
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
Play from 1991

420
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,039
Parametric design uses computer algorithms to allow you to plug in different variables

421
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,623
And see what the end result is each time you change something

422
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:48,767
Blackberry was one of the first Architects to use computers to design this way that we eventually figured out the

423
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,863
Frankie Ruiz team had also started using aeronautical software

424
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,959
To bring Gary strangely shaped curvaceous buildings into being

425
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:02,591
Every year I would go through LA and visit Frank's office and talk to the technical team and compare notes

426
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,663
Eventually Gary Technologies with help from work break

427
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,735
Went on to create their own parametric design software

428
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
Specifically for architects

429
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,367
By the early 2000 many of the most exciting new projects in architecture

430
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
We're being done this way

431
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,488
At the Forefront of this was a church designed over a century ago

432
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,768
By Antoni Gaudi

433
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
La Sagrada Familia

434
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,632
So from being the saloon Akron ISM in interesting but

435
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,680
Irrelevant it became actually live

436
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,520
Delete projects in the Hall of the digital Revolution affect

437
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:36,384
Parametric design allowed Mark Berry in the other Architects to move a lot

438
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,432
Faster on the interior of the church

439
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
Without this technology it's

440
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Possible

441
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,040
Stilbene note inside the sea

442
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,600
It was only a few years ago in 2010

443
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,184
The Architects were able to put the finishing touches on the interior

444
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,744
Now people line up around the block

445
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,024
I got a glimpse inside

446
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,608
And it really is Brett

447
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,656
Taking partly because of these things

448
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:03,264
Edibly tall columns that Gaudi designed the branch out like trees at the

449
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,568
Top and are capable of carrying

450
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,360
A tremendous amount of weight

451
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,200
When people go into that building I'm not suggesting

452
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,504
But it's necessarily always a religious

453
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Experience

454
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
But the

455
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,368
And surprise

456
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,928
Of walking in trailers doors

457
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,768
It felt like trees at the top and are capable of carrying

458
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,816
A tremendous amount of weight

459
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,632
When people go into that building I'm not

460
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
Suggesting

461
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
It is necessarily always a religious experience

462
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,776
The shock

463
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
And surprise

464
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
Of walking in trailers doors

465
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,688
Into this explosion of light

466
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
The light

467
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,528
Pours into giant stained glass windows

468
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,600
In the afternoon it's a red orange light

469
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,904
And in the morning it's a bluish-green light

470
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,208
And it filters through the huge

471
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
Tree like columns

472
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,280
You feel like you're in a forest

473
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
And you feel very tiny

474
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
If you're very small

475
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,168
You feel as if there's a hold of universe above you

476
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,008
But the building is still not finished

477
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:19,552
I'm in An Extremely Loud metal cage elevator that runs on the outside of the church with head on emo

478
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
Bruschetta

479
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,904
The architect volume at the very beginning of the story

480
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,536
And Anna Barbie who handles press for La Sagrada Familia

481
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,912
It's very safe on a says but it doesn't feel that safe

482
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:41,568
The elevator is shaking and we can see Barcelona getting smaller below us as we rattle ephylone beside the tower

483
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Church

484
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,712
The elevator door opens to a spec

485
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
Spectacular View

486
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
I'm breathtaking

487
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
We are standing on the

488
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Top

489
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
The Sagrada Familia

490
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
I have the parts

491
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,680
Barcelona city blocks stretch out all around us

492
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,496
To the east we can see the Mediterranean Sea

493
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,336
Until the South the mountain that Gowdy promise not to surpass

494
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,712
When the building is finished there will be 18 Towers

495
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,272
Including a new one right where I'm standing

496
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,576
This one will be the tallest of all

497
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:28,416
Reaching the 560 ft or 170 m

498
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
I don't email is working on designing it right now

499
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,536
And he's using the fragments

500
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
Gattis plaster models

501
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
To figure out how to do it

502
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,680
These will be Jesus Christ Our in the middle

503
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
One of Anjali

504
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:44,288
The architect of the building will be finished in 2026

505
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,848
The 100th anniversary of gaudi's death

506
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,152
But there is still a lot to be done

507
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:55,296
Meanwhile some of the neighbors seem set up with La Sagrada Familia and all of the congestion and Taurus

508
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,576
It brings to the neighborhood

509
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
Sometimes they're a little protest

510
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
Against the place

511
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,696
Like this one in 2011

512
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
Where locals chanted

513
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,280
No more tourist buses

514
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
The one their neighborhood back

515
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,984
The bigger the building gets

516
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
The more Taurus

517
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Come

518
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:23,712
130 years ago is Joseph vocab and decided to Bill Foster about a Familia

519
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,272
Cleanse the people of Barcelona up their sins

520
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,344
Spire the common folk to live a religious life

521
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:35,232
He picked a piece of land on the outskirts of the city where cows and goats would sometimes wonder

522
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:39,328
We probably never imagined that it would become tourist attraction it is today

523
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,912
Architect head-on T-Mobile shadow

524
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:48,288
Does one of the perks of working at La Sagrada Familia is getting to be inside the church

525
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
When no one else is

526
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Is there

527
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,616
Hermes

528
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,152
Is Israeli special

529
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
To be alone or to be

530
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,736
With not too many people

531
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:03,648
The church only holds one Mass a month right now and it can be hard as throngs of Taurus bump into you with their

532
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Bear selfie stick

533
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
To feel connected

534
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
The building as a place of worship

535
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:13,632
Geronimo let me come into the church with him in the early morning before it was open to the public

536
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,424
So that I could try to get a sense of it

537
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Are you going to feel that

538
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
Espiritual en.

539
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
Betty somebody somebody or something

540
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
More

541
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,896
Goddess symbol

542
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
Ansgear

543
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,272
To me and I'm not a religious person

544
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,088
La Sagrada Familia is not so much a testament

545
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,416
God as it is to humans and what they can create

546
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,488
The Gaudi would dispute that assessment

547
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
He once said

548
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:45,376
The creation continues incessantly through the media of man

549
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,680
The man does not create

550
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
He discovers

551
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,272
Coming up we discuss Kaldi's revolutionary models for La Sagrada Familia in a segment that was just

552
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,088
Too nerdy and dense for the piece itself

553
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
But it's new

554
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,904
It's too cool not to mention it at all

555
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
That's right after that

556
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Between the beats

557
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
Bongs and chatter of our devices

558
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:25,056
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

559
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
If

560
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:30,688
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

561
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:36,576
Talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remedy for all hearing that voice

562
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
Technology

563
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,368
She talked to us

564
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,416
It is a creation of Sonic trash

565
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,488
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

566
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,072
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

567
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,120
To make them more human

568
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
Turn the living room lights on

569
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Okay

570
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Dim the living room lights to 50

571
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
2%

572
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
Okay

573
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:05,760
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

574
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,808
Makes for a much more natural

575
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Experience

576
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
Turn the living room lights on

577
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
Dim the living room lights

578
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
50%

579
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:22,144
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

580
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,960
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

581
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,520
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

582
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,592
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

583
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,640
Right here on the 9th 9 p.m.

584
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,992
We need to talk about something

585
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,320
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating you tell yourself

586
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,160
It's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine

587
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,208
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

588
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:51,584
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

589
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,984
And you don't know why then it may be time to seek help go to oh my God. Info podcast

590
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:03,360
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

591
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
Oh my God

592
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
Flask podcast

593
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,248
What are things you mentioned that piece are these models

594
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
Destroyed and

595
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,624
How important they were in realizing gaudi's vision for La Sagrada Familia

596
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,952
Bluetooth technical to get into in the piece

597
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
Kolstad

598
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
Noses

599
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:24,096
And I asked him to come to the studio and explain gaudi's modeling technique

600
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,632
And why it is so important

601
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
The creation

602
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
La Sagrada Familia

603
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,960
With a lot of Arkansas

604
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Especially once

605
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
Do you like to use

606
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,824
Preferred to work in models rather than

607
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,152
Models helping experiment with really complex

608
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
Control structures

609
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,712
And Albany

610
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,528
Model out structural Arrangements test things out

611
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,856
Photograph as models in draw over the photo

612
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,160
The bottles were behind all of this

613
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Yes they were driving the design

614
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,280
And one of the things that you tied with a lot and bottles were variations on what

615
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
What's called a cabinet

616
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
Okay so what is a catenary arch

617
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
Catenary is

618
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
The curved shape

619
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
That a hanging chain assumes

620
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
Under its own weight

621
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Basically picture

622
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,616
Electric line suspended between Utah

623
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
Okay so you're driving on the highway

624
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,456
C2 utility

625
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,296
Electric line goes across them and there's that natural Boeing

626
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,320
Of the

627
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,344
Electrical wire

628
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
And that is

629
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
The Cat Mario

630
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
Exactly

631
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,696
And that term is actually

632
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
Drive from the Latin word for cheap

633
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,816
And it was already well-known by gaudi's time

634
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:30,400
That an optimal Arch shape could be made by mirroring

635
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
A catenary curve

636
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
Vertically

637
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,496
Basically you take that hanging curve

638
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,288
And you just flip it up

639
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,336
And that becomes the model of your

640
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
And that Arch

641
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,944
These building loads efficiently and a lot of God

642
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,040
Okay that makes sense you take this BO2 chain

643
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
Christy altomare

644
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
When you flip it over

645
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:54,208
And when Ukrainian churches in the gothic style this is a good way to create a good

646
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Model

647
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
But

648
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,792
Gowdy took the idea further

649
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
Chi hung strings

650
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
Other strings

651
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
Other strings

652
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,168
They added birdshot

653
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
To weight them down at structural intersections

654
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
Incredibles

655
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
Huge intricate

656
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
Wireframe model

657
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,104
End up looking about like Chandelier

658
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,176
And then God would use mirrors to flip

659
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
These vertically

660
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,504
And study the shapes they created

661
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,576
In order to shape his own elaborate building skeleton

662
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
And it sounds a lot like what

663
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,672
Leader Architects use

664
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Software for

665
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,232
When they did 3D model

666
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,280
Yeah there are a lot of parallel

667
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
Innocence

668
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,096
Long before parametric

669
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,400
Design was a computer software problem

670
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,936
Gowdy changed

671
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,776
Parameters in his models by moving strings and weights around to see how

672
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,568
Who's individual modifications

673
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,360
3shape an entire structure

674
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,456
And then a century later people came along and finally made these digital

675
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,992
Technically

676
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,528
Handmade models have been doing

677
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,624
Allowing Architects to see how small changes would Ripple out to their entire designs

678
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,672
So you know you can imagine

679
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,440
It would take like

680
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
Call Amanda

681
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,256
Moving around a little bit

682
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,304
And that deforms like all the other shape

683
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Types of Destruction

684
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
Right and then

685
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,936
Software you do this and nail the software

686
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,728
Cranks long and does its thing

687
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,264
But in gaudi's time

688
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
You would move a weight around

689
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
And you'd see how the

690
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:20,480
Connected set of chains with all kind of deform by adding a little bit of birdshot

691
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,248
211

692
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,552
That's amazing

693
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088
And it looks stunning

694
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,880
Yeah the results are amazing

695
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:32,512
A lot of people you know they think Audi and they think of these beautiful sculptural scenes in these details here

696
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,072
Created but underneath all of that is this

697
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
Billie lovely

698
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,120
Structural logic

699
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,728
Instagram Familia that those details are beautiful but so is this internal frame

700
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,520
Columns and arches

701
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
Vault

702
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,592
Branches up and out and creates a kind of

703
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
Fractal Forest

704
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
Spell because

705
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
He didn't spend a lot of time

706
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:54,784
Teaching or explaining his methods or really writing about his designs

707
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,344
And because his work was so out of sync with

708
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,464
What modern is for trying to do with the time he didn't always get a lot of recognition from the architectural

709
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:11,424
Pizzerias like a starchitect but in hiding yeah pretty much

710
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,472
Spend all this time bragging about what

711
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
That's so cool

712
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
These models are

713
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,664
Wheelie stunt they're amazing to look at him we have some pictures on our web

714
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,224
Yes we have a ton of pictures of

715
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
These bottles

716
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
But he made as well as be

717
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
A really beautiful Church

718
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,600
Help create

719
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136

726
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:54,176
I think the folks at La Sagrada Familia for spending so much time showing us around

727
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
It was a true privilege

728
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:00,320

Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad
