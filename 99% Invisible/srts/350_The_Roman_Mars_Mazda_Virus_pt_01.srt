This is 99% invisible

00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,328
I'm Roman Mars

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,888
On the last episode I promise you

4
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:09,216
Greatest podcast crossover event in history

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,008
And here it is

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,064
Reply all Alex Goldman

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,624
And this week BJ we have a super text

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,024
Supercuts

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,584
Part is Saginaw show where listeners come to us with her

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,400
Weird unsolvable Tech problems and

11
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,680
What is usually you

12
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,960
Goes out interest solvent

13
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
And you have one

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,288
Baidu

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,056
Tell me about it

16
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,360
We got an email from getting been

17
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,152
He lives in Houston

18
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
And Ben is a hoe

19
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,712
Huge fan of pikas

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
He has his own podcast

21
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,832
He said he listened to over 100 podcasts which like

22
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,112
Possible

23
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,184
He said that the one complaint he has about his podcast app

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,512
Is that a lease how much time he spends listening to podcasts

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:09,376
Who tells me how many overall days of podcasts I've listened to

26
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,424
And it's just more and more depressing

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
You know you like to guess

28
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,240
Sure yes

29
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
40 days

30
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,848
233

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,896
And recently he started having this

32
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,432
Very strange podcast

33
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,504
So

34
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Ben

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,136
Not too long ago got a new car it was a 2016 Mazda 6

36
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
And

37
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,976
The thing that he was most excited about in his new car

38
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
With that

39
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:41,376
He compared his phone using bluetooth so that he could listen to podcasts before he was like yes

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,424
For some reason

41
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,240
The radio in his new car

42
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,800
Refuses to play one podcast

43
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
And one podcast only

44
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,176
The radiotopia podcasts

45
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
99percentinvisible

46
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Really

47
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,296
Yes and it's driving him absolutely insane

48
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
His car Bluetooth has rejected

49
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Roman Mars and his stories

50
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:09,536
Yes I'm obviously like for people who don't know 90% visible host by Roman Mars

51
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,096
It's really great non-fiction podcast they tell

52
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,704
Like always art design like how things work in the world and why they're made

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,008
The way they're made like the stories behind those things

54
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,104
And apparently is the one I guess it doesn't work on his car

55
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
That's right

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,944
Turn fan to play 99% invisible

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,552
Through his car stereo while he was on the phone with me can you tell me exactly where you're sitting at the MoMA

58
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
I am sitting at my driver seat in my

59
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,440
2016 Mazda 6

60
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,744
And

61
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
Let me know when you press play

62
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
Press play right now

63
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:51,264
This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars

64
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
But

65
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,872
Like the display screen stops working at totally freezes

66
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,920
The buttons aren't working properly

67
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
He has no control it's just for playing on the phone

68
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
Record screen at all it still says whatever I played right before I presented

69
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,464
And then after about a minute

70
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
Passover

71
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,584
What you saw

72
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
And now it's cut off Andre

73
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Restart it

74
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,472
And I'm not playing 90% invisible anymore because every time I've done that

75
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,520
It's still playing it will freeze

76
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,896
How can you have a type problem where the trigger was

77
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Like content

78
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
You know it's weird right it's very weird

79
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,272
It's like it would make more sense to me if like

80
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
A broken a time you try to listen like

81
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
Podcasts at work

82
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
It didn't work for Car Talk

83
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,048
Okay maybe his car doesn't want to hear stories about sick cars maybe that's like upsetting or something like that

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,656
I really like that you've immediately got two cars a cheap sentience

85
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
You have any theories about what's going on

86
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,568
I don't know my best guess is that

87
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,176
Because I looked at the file sizes and I listen to things like hardcore history and

88
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,736
A blank check which have big file sizes

89
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:10,624
And it's not that my best guess is maybe he's using some sort of weird

90
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,416
Audio codec

91
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,256
Interac streams with my

92
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
System but I really couldn't tell you

93
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
So I don't know

94
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:25,727
Ben thinks that because Romans voice is so like warm and closing his podcasts

95
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,823
Maybe he's doing something specific and Technical

96
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
To the files to achieve that

97
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,175
That would be my actual gas is like it's like a

98
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,247
There's something about the actual kind of

99
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,599
File the way that Roman is putting you converting his bike as soon MP3

100
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
Does just like too complicated for Ben's

101
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
Car system

102
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
And I was thinking about it and I was like

103
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:52,095
These are the two constants in his problem one is the podcast it's always the same pot

104
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Any other has been it's always the same radio

105
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
I was like maybe just act like a battery

106
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,287
But even if it's a bad radio silly Jersey just like why is this radio bad

107
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
Only

108
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
Not only that

109
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
But

110
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
We got another email

111
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
From another person

112
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
Experiencing

113
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
Exactly the same problem

114
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
With exactly the same podcast that is so weird

115
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,255
All right

116
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
Hello how you doing

117
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
I'm good

118
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
How you doing I'm good

119
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,503
It is a pleasure to hear your voice

120
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,343
Yeah man but me as well I was very delighted to get your email

121
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
Are you

122
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,207
Are you totally in the dark as to why I would reach out to you

123
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
Totally

124
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,375
So I told Roman why I was telling him and I told him about what was going on with in the car

125
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
There's one

126
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,471
That causes his car stereo

127
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Jefferies

128
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,055
Shutdown and restart

129
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,383
And Roman had actually heard about this problem

130
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
From other listener

131
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,455
Yeah I don't know what it is

132
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
We got some details

133
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,063
Read a few times were few different people

134
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
But

135
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,159
I've never really figured it out

136
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
All Roman nose is that

137
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
In some cars

138
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
Bluetooth classic car radio

139
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
What's 99percentinvisible

140
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
Cousin everything to break

141
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
But he has no idea why

142
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
So

143
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,959
Iran Bentley

144
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
He's like what Roman obviously cares about the

145
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,895
Sort of texture of the sound maybe he's doing something very specific to his file

146
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
And I'm curious little

147
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
What is what is your setup like

148
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,807
You have a strange microphone of some kind

149
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
No I mean we have

150
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
A couple are you

151
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,719
Like a shotgun mic in the studio

152
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:59,327
But you're not using some kind of special encoding settings that are different from the rest of radiotopia

153
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,239
Roman said that he had a theory that he's actually pretty confident about which is

154
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
The thing that makes

155
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
His podcast unusual

156
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Is that

157
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
It uses the percent sign

158
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,407
Percent sign

159
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,223
As into % 99percentinvisible

160
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
Oh

161
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,647
He was like it must just not play well with the stereo for some reason

162
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
So it's like

163
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:31,071
Because it's Derek also display the name of the podcast there's something about just there being a symbol where does inspector to be a symbol where it

164
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:37,215
Brakes and it really bums Roman out honestly he's been hearing about it for years

165
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
From other people who are not been

166
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
But

167
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
Like what can you do about it

168
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,895
He's not going to change the name of the podcast

169
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:50,271
You know like I would love it to be fixed and I really if someone is a fan of the show I really hate for them not to be able to hear it

170
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:56,927
I wish I could be better but I think I recognize the futility of me fighting and I think is that I feel

171
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,999
Like a primary fundamental tenet

172
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
Super tech support

173
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,583
Is a realizing that something is futile

174
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,655
And relever well outside of our capability

175
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
And

176
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,543
Putting on a football helmet and running headfirst into it anyway

177
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
I mean if you solve it I would be

178
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
Really grateful

179
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,479
It just said it just like when it just seemed like there's these those were those things were

180
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
All these Technologies are

181
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
Butting up against each other

182
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
And all I am

183
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
Is some little bit of grit

184
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
That

185
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,511
Gets caught between the gears

186
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Youku

187
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
Companies

188
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
You know

189
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
Not knowing how to

190
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
Past things off and talk to each other

191
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
That's what I feel like I am

192
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,591
The irony of this was crazy make

193
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
99percentinvisible

194
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,735
Podcast dedicated to explaining the beauty of good design

195
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,575
That is the one podcast that breaks when you try and play it on Ben's Mazda

196
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:01,695
It just felt like an imbalance in the universe that I had to correct and

197
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
Romans theory about the percent sign

198
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
It felt really plausible to me

199
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
So I thought I'd start there

200
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
And I figured like

201
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
If a percent sign car trouble

202
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
Because it's a special character

203
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,495
Other special characters to break the car to

204
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
So I just wanted to test that theory

205
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,615
Visit your thing like classic tech support problem like you have to

206
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
Replicate the glitch

207
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,455
To understand it to solve it exact

208
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
So I started thinking about other special characters like you know what about like the carrot or the curly brackets or

209
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Whatever

210
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,767
Curly brackets

211
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Okay

212
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
So

213
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,887
We wanted to make a podcast that would break his stare

214
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
And to do that we divide the test

215
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Who's we

216
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
Me

217
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,823
Most of the team to be honest

218
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
Okay with me Tim

219
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
Anna Sophia

220
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
Emmanuel shruthi

221
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
Damiano

222
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:02,367
I was about to make fun of you guys because like oh why is it take that many people to make a podcast but it's like

223
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
Also

224
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
We did make one podcasts

225
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
How many markers did you make

226
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Well

227
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
Start at beginning

228
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
The first podcast

229
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
Carrot space carrot

230
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:22,079
You know the carrot which is at the top of the little pointy the pointy upwards Arrow

231
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
Whose job is it to make the Pie cast iron

232
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
I would mind

233
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Okay

234
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:32,575
AO3 nights like a child's drawing of like a Bugs Bunny carrot and then in the background there's a planet how I get it it's like

235
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,647
Carrots and space I'm just for you

236
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:42,559
Coleman territory

237
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:47,423
Hello welcome to the carrot space character

238
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,263
I recorded this in my attic

239
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,663
ASMR that like printers

240
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,063
Has slimmers that travel forward through time

241
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
Atomic red carrot

242
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:14,303
Hot pretty sister.

243
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,423
Relaxed relaxed how do you feel

244
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,823
Hypnotize me to go to sleep so I can mug my data Queen Anne's Lace and dialects

245
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
Negative Queen Anne's Lace

246
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
We made it podcast

247
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,551
We uploaded podcast apps and to an RSS feed

248
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,855
I gave it to bed

249
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
And I asked him to try it in his car

250
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Glamazon

251
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
And we'll see if it breaks your a car stereo

252
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,791
Let's do it

253
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
And but

254
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,823
Hello Karen speech

255
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,455
Can you look at your screen and see how this is affecting your

256
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
Syria

257
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
I have to tell you it's

258
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,135
It is functioning completely normally

259
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
Interesting

260
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,023
It also means it's not filtering for the quality of podcast

261
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:24,447
So then we wanted to make a podcast to test the less-than symbol the tilde which is the symbol that means uproxx

262
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
Ultimately and the greater than

263
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
I'm just going to play that

264
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,151
Most jaunty

265
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,967
Hi this is samin nosrat

266
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,015
Welcome to greater than less than

267
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,343
You got some

268
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:48,767
Samin wrote the book Salt Fat acid heat and she also has a Netflix show by the same name

269
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:55,167
Today I'm joined by a cooking new Alex

270
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
Goldman

271
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
Oh I'm so glad you could be here

272
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,359
You got her teach you cooking I've been trying to learn cooking for a book for like a year

273
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:10,271
A berry cough with tea is basically a pancake with berries in it but instead of being cooked on the stove it's

274
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Cooked in the oven

275
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Okay

276
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
Do you feel like this

277
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
I feel very well for a Mazda

278
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,487
What you have to understand about this is this isn't your average cooking show

279
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,375
Because the only way that you could give me instructions as by telling me the ingredients were less than approximately or greater than

280
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
We need a

281
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
I have my heart

282
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
Hbase

283
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,359
Less than approximately are greater than some other thing

284
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
So I let me find an example

285
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:44,319
The measurement for the sugar should be about do you have you ever had one of those toys that you eat

286
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Stress balls

287
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
Yes

288
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
Okay you should put about a stress ball amount of

289
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,511
So you're saying like greater than one of those Super Bowl

290
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
This is

291
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Greater than a Super Bowl

292
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
Okay okay

293
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
For the eggs can you add an amount of exits greater than the number of nipples you have

294
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,175
So you're saying like

295
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
Less than the sides of a

296
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Square

297
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
Correct

298
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
Anyway

299
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,879
At the barre class 40 I made as you might imagine.

300
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
Was not edible

301
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
So did this break the Mazda

302
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
He popped it in the podcast player

303
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
Hi this is so mean

304
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,119
Go get the greater than less than

305
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,423
It seems to be working just fine

306
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
So at this point we have tried

307
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
The carrot

308
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:42,431
The tilde the less than sign the greater than sign we made another podcast where we tested the play

309
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
Plus sign equal sign

310
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
The curly brackets

311
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
None of them

312
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
Replicating is prop

313
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:55,231
Have you ever had that thing happened where you go to get like an object repaired and the people and repair chapter about the object differently than you care about it

314
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Guarantee mean

315
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,351
What district is Harley needs like to be a double neck guitar in right now it doesn't

316
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:05,471
Then they're just like doing it and they're often doing it you're as I gave more of a relation to the work they want to do than to helping you

317
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,287
I don't know what you're talking about Tammy there okay

318
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,127
But of course at this point we were definitely going to test

319
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Right right

320
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:20,063
Some would want to make a bunch of garbage podcast

321
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
How dare you call this garbage

322
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,415
So we made a podcast that was called

323
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
100% related

324
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,863
Hi my name is Alice Goldin and you're looking to 100% related

325
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
The price of it is

326
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,031
A couple days ago I was talking to our editor Tim Howard and he insisted

327
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:45,663
But I was only 50% related to my dad because I only have 50% of my dad's genes

328
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:52,831
Father answer your 50% relieve your dad your 50% related your mom I'm a hundred my opinion is I'm a hundred percent related to book

329
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
In hims worldview yes

330
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,231
And so what we did is we got my dad a former judge to adjudicate this argument

331
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,375
Thank you what should I call you should I call you judge Goldman or should I call you whatever

332
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,703
Now I'd like for you to lay out your case to him because what you're saying is insane

333
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
Well

334
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,079
I really just seems to me that if you were a hundred percent related

335
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
You

336
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Wood

337
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
You would be mark

338
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,015
And you are not

339
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,319
You're 50% related

340
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
So okay

341
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
What I'm saying is like

342
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
I'm 100%

343
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,767
Related to anyone who's my relative

344
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,583
So you are as related

345
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,167
To your father as any other human being

346
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
That's what you're saying

347
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,239
And him are on the same page

348
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
Spoiler alert

349
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
So is my dad

350
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,871
Tell Tim your dad took Tim side yes

351
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
Good man

352
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:54,015
So why is this the podcast I cuz I like arguing with you is like for fans of arguing with you

353
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
I don't feel

354
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
So

355
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:04,511
The percent sign related to the thing

356
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,119
So clearly we were wrong about all the special characters breaking the radio witch

357
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
Surprise me

358
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
But

359
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
I just wanted to confirm

360
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,311
The one thing that we were actually confident was true

361
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
Which was that the percent sign

362
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
So I get back in the podcast

363
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
All right

364
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
All right

365
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,319
Is it freezing your

366
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Stereo

367
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,903
Allison really sorry to say no

368
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
It is totally normal

369
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,999
But how is that

370
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
How is that possible

371
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,887
So clearly this caught me off guard

372
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,959
Seromas whole Theory they found so obvious

373
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
It doesn't seem to

374
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,895
It has to be something

375
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,967
Within the file itself that they are uploading this bus

376
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,527
That it doesn't actually have anything to do

377
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
Interesting

378
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
But n Ben

379
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
Tell the something that

380
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,415
Again

381
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
Befuddled

382
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
Okay which is

383
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,791
Ben 10 a copy of a 99percentinvisible episode

384
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
On YouTube

385
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
And tried playing that

386
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,703
So he was like I'm going to see if pirated 990i works

387
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
And

388
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
It breaks the car

389
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,591
Brakes the car and your brakes

390
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:30,271
Which is weird because it just means like it's is not actually anything about the file itself because when someone's uploading a podcast

391
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,855
YouTube that's totally new file yes it's like the content

392
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,439
It's like the car is sentient and doesn't like Roman Mars

393
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,255
And so Ben would like the only option is that

394
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
There must be some

395
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,071
Some Sonic

396
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:49,471
Frequency that is breaking the car and I was like a note in Romans I said if you were just sitting in a Mazda and started talking too loud the cartridge

397
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
IFile

398
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
There's a rumor that there is

399
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
I'm very familiar

400
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
Is that the sound real

401
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:03,551
I don't think it's not real but I'm glad I've been thinking about it this whole time

402
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,183
I've been thinking about it since the story began and I could like

403
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,839
I'm in mixed company I can bring this up but you stop yourself from saying something one time

404
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,959
Everybody

405
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
I hope so

406
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
Okay

407
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
So

408
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
We're like okay

409
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
We have no idea we're like totally back and forth

410
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
You got to find them

411
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,551
Subway

412
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,391
Any other reason this doesn't make any sense is because

413
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
Roman has another podcast

414
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
About Trump

415
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:48,095
And constitutional law yeah it's called what Trump can teach us about con law fine

416
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,911
Romans voice doesn't break the radio on that podcast

417
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
Only when it's 99percentinvisible

418
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
So what happened

419
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,591
U-Haul John Mazda we call the company that makes the radio

420
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,479
We called Ben's Mazda dealer we are specifically dealing with a Mazda Tech problem

421
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,319
From a person who's in your service area and I was wondering if I could ask you

422
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
A question or two about it

423
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
They weren't familiar with

424
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,951
So we called Andrew quits

425
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
The CTO of PRX the public radio Exchange

426
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,327
Hello Steve Andrews

427
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,631
Oh hello how are you I'm good

428
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,983
He's in charge of how the show gets uploaded to podcast apps that RSS feeds

429
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,775
Cedar County everybody be like have you heard

430
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Yeah

431
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,103
And Andrew said that he heard of it

432
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,943
And that he'd always figured like Roman that was the percent sign

433
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
But I told him about the test that we do

434
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
All of them work

435
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
Including 100% really

436
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
That's

437
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,719
He's like

438
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,767
So painful these kind of bugs

439
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
No one knew what was going on

440
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
And then

441
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
I saw this ahead of you

442
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,703
So did that

443
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,263
She actually got back in touch with us and said

444
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,079
Hey I've been running some tests on my own

445
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
I tried uploading a couple podcast

446
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
And

447
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,759
What I found is that it's not the % alone that is causing this issue

448
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,599
It is the percent sign followed by an uppercase i

449
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
That shuts down there

450
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
Lowercase i

451
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
It doesn't uppercase i

452
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
It shut down

453
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
That's all we know

454
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,608
We don't know why because I hate your car doesn't fly

455
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,888
Lowercase i

456
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,960
I got a guy

457
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
That's exactly right

458
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,824
So we're getting closer

459
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,640
And then you know arpel Kurt Melby who

460
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,712
Where to get my it works again when I play fortnite with most weekends

461
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,784
Who does coding at the at the office yet

462
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
He had an idea

463
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
Alex

464
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,672
Thank you for coming to the studio today thank you

465
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:54,304
The reason that we have you here is because you're the person who actually uploaded the

466
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,840
Podcasts that we made

467
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,400
Yeah you know this

468
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
But none of them work

469
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
I listen to them also and over

470
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,080
Surprised that didn't work

471
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
Alright smart guy

472
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
Kurt says I have a theory

473
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,224
The theory is

474
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
That

475
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,320
The programming language C

476
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
Oh I know it is I know it happen

477
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,464
Literally 99% mean something

478
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,000
Can you turn off your stereo

479
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,584
I would say you're close but not exactly

480
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,120
In a programming language C

481
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,680
Basically in some scenarios

482
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
The percent sign means hey

483
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,824
The character immediately following me the character immediately following the percent sign

484
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
Think about that like code rather than liked

485
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
End and start

486
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,016
Parsing bat as though it's asking you to run command

487
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
Being called Princess

488
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,416
NC that's like used very very common lean heavily

489
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,720
Another languages of copy this feature

490
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
2

491
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,560
Interpolate is the technical term

492
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,632
Interpolate the number into the string

493
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,936
And he said percent I

494
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
In

495
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
C & C

496
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:12,384
Is a command where a percent are which would be 100% related

497
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
?

498
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,432
Is not so like

499
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,992
What's the command what is percent I tell

500
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Computer to Dell

501
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,344
So I have it up here it has to do with

502
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
Basically 2% in NC

503
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,208
Has to do with displaying integers

504
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,560
NC I know this is very confused

505
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
So

506
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,192
Percent and then a bunch of different letters tell it to display integers in a certain

507
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
In a certain way

508
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,752
But basically what's happening

509
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
It sounds like

510
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,056
Is the car

511
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
Stereo

512
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
Hey guess what

513
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
He thinks is it audio file

514
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
What is an audiophile

515
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,504
Okay this part of the information I have is just for the humor

516
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,528
This is like the title

517
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,184
Yeah 99 and then it there's some stuff for you the robots to understand

518
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
I can't get confused and a chest

519
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
Yes

520
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,608
So there's a bunch of different commands in C that would cause this to happen

521
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,680
Okay and so we were like okay

522
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,776
If curtright we should be able to test this with other commands

523
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,336
And those should also mess up the car stereo

524
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,872
And so

525
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,200
We made one more podcast

526
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
With another one of the

527
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,600
Another one of the recognized piece of syntax which is the letter which is the letter

528
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Key

529
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
Which when it follows the % becomes the pointer at

530
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Grass whatever that means

531
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,096
Okay but whatever as long as going to code it should shut down the stereo. That's what happen

532
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,680
So we made a podcast that's called 88% parents

533
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:50,432
This is Erica

534
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,736
Edelbrock

535
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,320
Let me tell you about this document I've been waiting for

536
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,928
This one piece of paper it was going to change everything I thought I understood it for now

537
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
It arrived on a Monday

538
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,280
Monday began like a normal day

539
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,560
I was walking to work

540
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
With my dog

541
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,864
His name is Bruno by the way

542
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,752
Come with that name my name to Bruno he's a rescue dog he came with a name like Bradley or something which I really didn't like

543
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:21,152
So I changed it to Bruno which by the way is the name I also wanted to name my son but my

544
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
I understand what you've done

545
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Who is Bruno

546
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,784
And we get there it's a short walk like maybe 10 minutes which is

547
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
Crazy because people are always like what

548
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:35,232
Podcasts to listen to what podcast you listen to cuz you make podcast and I'm like not that many cuz I'm such a short walk to work anyway

549
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
The strong okay

550
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
I've heard enough

551
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
Okay

552
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:48,800
All seems like people are like I went the next season of Serial coming out like 20 minutes later than it would

553
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,408
So what happened

554
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,968
Well we send it Urban

555
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,272
And it didn't break the car stereo

556
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
I didn't break it

557
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
So that screwed up the whole Theory

558
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Absolutely

559
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
I mean

560
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
We didn't just try

561
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:12,096
Percent P we tried a bunch of different things that should have broken the car stereo in the same way the percent Idol

562
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,144
And none of them cause a problem

563
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
So what that is Kirstie rebunk

564
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,752
Curtsy reappears

565
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
Not to work

566
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,104
The only combination that did anything what percent

567
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,408
Followed by an uppercase i

568
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,944
Okay but we don't know why

569
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
Noe.

570
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,528
And it is driving

571
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,552
Peanuts

572
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,624
And this is the point in the story where Andrew cuckoo it's comes to the rescue

573
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160
Andrew Cuomo

574
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:41,792
Remember he's the CTO at public radio exchange the company that distributes 99%

575
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,352
He really dove

576
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
Like he

577
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,960
Really invested what is that mean

578
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
Well

579
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,384
You know we're trying to figure out a way to diagnose this properly without actually having access to the code

580
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,016
You made a bunch of nonsense podcast for no reason you talk to somebody worked at a Mazda dealership and one guy at work

581
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,064
We also called master

582
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,024
Andrew was God until like a Mazda owners message board and found the actual code

583
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,304
Code

584
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,704
For the Mazda connect infotainment system really and within the code from the name of one of your

585
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,008
Original authors of the original code

586
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,800
Which event gave to us

587
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:29,408
Author of the code for the Mazda car stereo program yes

588
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:35,552
His name is Brandon Guzman that you can look

589
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,880
Encode and see the codes author like I didn't know that

590
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,440
There's a way to write your authorship in your code

591
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
And it's been

592
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,792
Done forever as always like that like a signature on a painting

593
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:51,168
It's a little a lot of times it's harder to find you have access to the code to see the authorship

594
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,496
And my favorite story about this is early in

595
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:59,616
The development of Atari games Atari would not allow the author of The Game to put their name on it

596
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:04,224
Because there's being a company about it and so the author of the game Adventure

597
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,528
Create this incredibly arcane

598
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,552
Set up

599
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,648
Things that you had to do in the game so that you would find a secret room

600
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,208
They just flashed his name in the center of the screen

601
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
That's brilliant and sad

602
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
Because it said that they had to go to that much work.

603
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
I just feel like I made that anyway

604
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
Chicken tenders Brandon

605
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,216
Yes he works on exercise technology now

606
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,776
Work work

607
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,336
We develop connected strength products

608
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,384
As a person who's terrible at exercising

609
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,200
I'm not your toy

610
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:40,320
Yeah baby irony is the entire office of us working on this or not either

611
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,880
We're more like stay up late and Senator computer longer

612
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,488
So we told Brandon what was going on with Benz car

613
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:52,096
And he told us that he was pretty sure he knew what was going on

614
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
Which is

615
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
So

616
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,192
What he said was

617
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:01,056
One thing that caught my eye immediately is that there's a percent symbol in the name

618
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,152
And that has some special meetings and things like a URL

619
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
Right

620
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:11,296
Is a URL certain characters are allowed in certain characters are not

621
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:15,648
So our operating Theory with 8% I was breaking a radio

622
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
Because

623
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
The percent sign followed by the letter i

624
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,024
Meant something in the programming language C

625
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
But what Brandon told us was

626
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,120
Know that program wasn't even written in C

627
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,168
Is written in a totally different program

628
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Okay

629
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
Into the radio

630
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,032
Super Sentai doesn't actually mean anything

631
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,848
Brennan think the problem is

632
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,248
Is that the code should tell the radio to ignore things that doesn't understand or that don't mean anything

633
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,064
But in this case for whatever reason it's not

634
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
So the radio Super Sentai

635
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
It just keeps

636
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,696
Desperately trying to figure out what it means

637
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
So it's like it's having a panic attack

638
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
Kind of

639
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Is an eye

640
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,632
And so then

641
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
I was like okay

642
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,704
So why is the stereo restarting

643
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,520
And Brandon told me that when they designed the car

644
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,312
They made it to the radio

645
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:09,408
With regularly sending a little message to the rest of the car saying

646
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,224
I'm working I'm working I'm working Brandon call it a heart

647
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:13,760
And

648
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,808
The hardware layers listening for that

649
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
As long as it gets it

650
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
It's happy

651
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
If it doesn't get it

652
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,232
It will assume that the UI has frozen

653
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
And it will

654
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,304
Restart it to a known good state

655
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,864
It's it's saying it's not communicating with me

656
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
Something is wrong

657
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,216
And it just start start over

658
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,264
So if it freezes up

659
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,080
It's in the heartbeat

660
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:44,736
It is trained to automatically shut down and start back up by the computer is that swipes

661
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,784
Takes a nap

662
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,064
That wakes up and tries again

663
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,928
I really like how much effort we put into personifying these cars

664
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,976
I just understand that they're sentient

665
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,792
I do feel like this by original Theory

666
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,608
Like everybody else they freak out with it on the right answer

667
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
Threat

668
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,984
There is one other thing that was suggested to us

669
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,032
Several times along the way

670
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
Benz

671
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,384
Car stereo firmware

672
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,992
Is a few

673
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:22,368
So the theory is that it might fix this problem

674
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,904
According to myself

675
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:28,256
But been looked into getting a firmware updated and it was just too expensive

676
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
However

677
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,400
That doesn't mean that we don't have a more permanent solution for bed in Roma

678
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
Because

679
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
Andrew Collette from PRX

680
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
Had a very sweet idea

681
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,104
Maybe we got a publisher version of 99% invisible with some slightly different

682
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,640
Titles or something

683
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,920
I'd be willing to

684
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,200
Create the

685
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,272
The Mazda version of the feed be great

686
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,296
Love you super cool

687
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:56,416
There's just like a 99percentinvisible for bed and other Mazda owners feed

688
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:03,072
Why can't say that people in Nissans have also reported having this problem but yes for Mazda owners in Nissan owners who are having problems with this

689
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,608
Epic infotainment system

690
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,888
Asbury News podcast

691
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
So

692
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,264
I called been up one more time

693
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
Just let me know if

694
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,616
If I when you got it set up and ready to roll

695
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
Welding

696
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,480
This is 99% invisible

697
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,112
Tim Harford is a master at picking up

698
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,904
Perfect little story

699
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,952
And everything's working fine

700
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Yep

701
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,792
So this is totally works

702
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,096
Set plane normally not freezing at all

703
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
Perfect

704
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:50,432
What a link to the Mazda safe 99p I feed on our website it's 99 Pi. Org

705
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
Have the break

706
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,600
Will feature 3 full episodes of the fake podcast from the story

707
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:04,000
I think they play the full episodes it would have disrupted their story too much but they are gems and I really want to play them for you

708
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
But the best

709
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,984
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made

710
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,752
Sound

711
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:21,920
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

712
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,808
Technology talk to us

713
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,112
It is a creation of Sonic trash

714
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,928
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

715
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:38,560
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology to make them more human

716
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,656
Turn the living room lights on

717
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
Okay

718
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
Dim the living room lights to 50

719
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,008
80%

720
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Okay

721
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:55,200
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

722
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,016
Makes for a much more natural experience

723
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,064
Turn the living room lights on

724
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,160
Dim the living room lights to 50%

725
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:11,584
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

726
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
About how are sounds gay

727
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
Is impacting our health

728
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,960
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

729
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,032
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

730
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,080
Right here on the 99 pi

731
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:28,224
And now 80% parentheticals 100% related

732
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,784
And greater than less than approximately

733
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,064
In their entirety

734
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:38,976
This is Sarah came to 88% parentheticals

735
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,632
Let me tell you about this document I've been waiting for

736
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,192
This one piece of paper that was going to change

737
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,240
Everything I thought I understood up to now

738
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,544
It arrived on a Monday

739
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,872
Monday began like a normal day I was walking to work

740
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
With my dog

741
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,176
His name is Bruno by the way

742
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:04,576
He didn't come with that name I name to Bruno he's a rescue dog he came with a name like Bradley or something which I really didn't like

743
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:09,952
Which by the way is the name I also wanted to name my son but my husband Nix that

744
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:16,352
Anyway I'm walking to work with Bruno and we get there it's a short walk like maybe 10 minutes which is

745
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:22,752
Crazy because people are always like what podcast you listen to what podcast you listen to cuz you make podcast and I'm like not that many cuz I'm such a

746
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,544
Short walk to work anyway

747
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,848
Reach to unlock the door

748
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,432
And I notice it at the bottom of the door there is this envelope

749
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,224
With just my name on it

750
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,760
No return address

751
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,296
I hate that why

752
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:40,672
Do people not put Retin-A understand if you need to be anonymous but just generally I can always teach my kids

753
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:44,000
Put your return address on the envelope in case it gets lost

754
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,816
Anyway and one time I did get this

755
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:50,656
Crazy Anonymous letter which is a whole other story I can tell you about another time

756
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,496
Anyway so I open this envelope with just my name on it

757
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,312
And inside is a single document

758
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,848
Which I'll tell you about

759
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
Next time

760
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:11,648
This episode of 88% parentheticals was produced by Emmanuel Joshi or editor is Tim Howard music

761
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
Music is by the mysterious breakmaster cylinder

762
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:21,120
You can check us out online or so I've been told I've never checked myself on iTunes or wherever you get your podcast

763
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:44,416
Hi

764
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:48,768
Listen to 100% related a podcast about family

765
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
All right

766
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:55,424
Let's start the show

767
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
Hello

768
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
Father

769
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,920
Hello I am recording you right now in the interest of full disclosure

770
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,712
Alright you have my permission

771
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
Thank you

772
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,552
I'm in the studio with Tim Howard or editor

773
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,088
Hi how are you

774
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,744
Doing wonderful thank you what should I call you should I call you judge Goldman or should I call you mark

775
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,048
Mark all right that's me and Mark what should I call you

776
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,352
You should call me just

777
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
Got to love it

778
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:31,776
So we are actually calling upon you in your capacity as a judge me we are having a disagreement

779
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,360
And we would like you to hear both sides and adjudicated

780
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,432
All right because first is a plaintiff

781
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,784
That's it I'd say that to measure

782
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,600
T came to me yesterday with a bold proposition

783
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
I profoundly disagree

784
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,976
Yeah okay so I'll just tell you what it was

785
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,768
It just simply that

786
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,304
For some reason

787
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,840
Alex and I

788
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,424
I don't know how we got on the topic but I argue to Alex

789
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
That he

790
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
And you

791
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,032
Are 50% related

792
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,080
And I said that we are a hundred

793
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,896
I'd like for you to lay out your case to

794
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,176
Because what you're saying is insane

795
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:15,552
It really just seems to me that if you were a hundred percent related

796
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
You

797
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Wood

798
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,440
You would be mark

799
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,488
And you are not

800
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,792
You're 50% related

801
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
So okay

802
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,400
What I'm saying is like

803
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,448
When you're related to someone

804
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:36,544
You're 100% related to them regardless of how many genes you share

805
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Look

806
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,152
I have like a Mike I have like a second cousin twice removed

807
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
To get out who like

808
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
Act like my aunt's

809
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Grandson

810
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,832
My cousin's kid 100% related to that

811
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,624
A person I'm a hundred percent

812
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
Related

813
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,184
To anyone whose relative

814
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,000
So you are as related

815
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
To your father as

816
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,608
Any other human being that's what you're saying

817
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,912
But you cannot be more related

818
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,192
Or less related

819
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,216
To anybody

820
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
Well this feels like a

821
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,848
Like more like a less like a math argument more like a semantics

822
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,456
I mean I don't know but yeah I'm just I'm just following your logic here

823
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,760
My logic is you can have a closer relation

824
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,832
In that Oso higher percentage

825
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:26,208
Judge objection

826
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,256
Is that all you got

827
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,048
What are you talkin about

828
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:36,448
Makes perfect sense what I'm saying we're not done with the idea that you just said that you can be club or closely related

829
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,544
But it's not a percentage what is it an on-off

830
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
Okay

831
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,616
Alright let me let me let me let me ask a question

832
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
Okay

833
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,200
So I might get a genetic testing

834
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,528
About 45 years ago

835
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,088
This doesn't sound good for me

836
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,160
In NFL once every 3 or 4 months

837
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,976
I get this notice from the company that says

838
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,768
We have found more relatives

839
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:07,680
And these relatives

840
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
Of my

841
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
Genetic

842
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:11,776
Makeup

843
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:16,896
Okay but this company which is 23andMe still consider these people to be relics

844
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:23,040
Although I've never heard their name I don't know what a access point

845
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,344
0.65% genetic

846
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
Identity

847
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,464
Alright

848
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:34,560
Is related to them as unrelated few out

849
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
F*** you

850
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:44,032
I'm get arrested at that point in court don't you

851
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,336
It's contempt of court attempt of court

852
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:52,992
All right

853
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,552
Thank thank you so much Mark

854
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,624

I theme song by The Mysterious breakmaster cylinder

862
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,824
Hi this is

863
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,895
Welcome to greater than less than approximately

864
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:05,951
Today I'm joined by a cooking newbie Alex

865
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,535
Goldman thanks for having me oh I'm so glad you could be here

866
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,095
We're going to make a barre class

867
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:17,983
What is a berry clafouti is basically a pancake with berries

868
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
But instead of

869
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,031
Being cooked on the

870
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
Stove is

871
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
Cooked in the oven

872
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,335
Okay

873
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,383
Do you feel like you can do that with me today

874
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,663
I feel very excited to

875
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,711
Okay are you in your kitchen

876
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
I am in my kitchen

877
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,783
I've got that much down

878
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,575
Okay good that's the right room to be in

879
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,903
Alright alright let's make sure you have all of your ingredient

880
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,695
We need milk do you have milk

881
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,975
Got it okay

882
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,511
Do you have sugar

883
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
Yes

884
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:42,559
An Egg's

885
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,583
Yes

886
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,631
Vanilla we need some salt

887
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,911
I have salt

888
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:49,471
And then you need some flour

889
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,007
Got it

890
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,567
And some do you have any berries around

891
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:58,431
I have some blueberries perfect blueberries are great okay okay the first steps to making

892
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,735
Is that we need to turn on the oven

893
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:05,599
So you have her heat your oven to a temperature

894
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
That's

895
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
A little bit

896
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,695
Less than the number of days in a year

897
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:16,351
Okay so we're talking like the number of degrees in a circle roughly approximately maybe a little bit less than that

898
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,887
Okay alright okay

899
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:23,519
And then you have to imagine that you're going to bake this pancake in a dish it could be any shape

900
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:28,639
It could be round or rectangular or like ovular I guess would be a word

901
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:33,759
But it needs to be approximately the size of like a

902
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
Small

903
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
Pan pizza

904
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
Okay let me take a look old

905
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
Okay I think I got it

906
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
Okay great

907
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,279
So we're going to need to measure out some milk

908
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,119
Basically I want you to put the amount of milk

909
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,959
That is like approximately you know like

910
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,775
Like a small jar of mayonnaise

911
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
Amount

912
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
So like

913
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:03,967
Smaller than a full ketchup bottle definitely less than a full ketchup

914
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,271
Like a bottle of ketchup

915
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,319
That has been used

916
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
Generous

917
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:16,767
And then we're going to put some sugar the measurement for the sugar should be about

918
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:21,119
Do you have you ever had one of those toys that you know those stress balls

919
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,143
Yes

920
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,703
Okay you should put about a stress ball amount of shoe

921
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
Into the wall

922
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,287
So you're saying like greater than one of those Super Bowl

923
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,103
Yes greater greater than a Super Bowl

924
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,151
But less than a softball

925
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
Okay

926
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
Okay

927
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,039
For the egg

928
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,599
Can you add an amount of eggs

929
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,903
It's greater than the number of nipples you have

930
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,231
First of all it's very presumptuous of you to know how many nipples I have

931
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,255
Second of all

932
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,047
So you're saying like

933
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,351
Less than the sides of a

934
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
Square correct

935
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
All right

936
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,311
And I feel like I was born to bake

937
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,103
Really good I mean it looks really good

938
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,407
For vanilla

939
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,943
We're going to put

940
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,503
Less than the number of lights on a

941
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,039
Traffic light amount

942
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
Glug

943
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,831
Into the ball

944
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,111
You got it

945
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,719
I put it I put some plugs in there

946
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,791
Okay great I want you to put more than

947
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
Twice

948
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,839
The amount

949
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,167
Planets in the solar system of grains of

950
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,447
Salt into the bowl

951
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
You got it

952
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,751
Done

953
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,567
When it comes to the flower

954
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,127
How how big is your big child

955
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
Harvey

956
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,943
He is

957
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,223
I don't know I'll be

958
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,807
Is he bigger than like 3 basketball stacked up

959
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
Yes

960
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,951
Alright I basically I want to imagine the size of Harvey's foot

961
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:54,815
Okay could you do a little more flour than the size of Harvey's foot into the bowl

962
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,143
A little more flour than the size of Harvey's foot

963
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:04,287
Now what you're going to have to do is use your whisk

964
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,847
To blend everything until it's

965
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,151
Really smooth and frothy

966
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,671
All right it is looking pretty frothy

967
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,695
Okay great

968
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,255
Now you're going to pour enough batter

969
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,327
To create a layer that's a little bit thicker than a piece of

970
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,119
Cardboard into the bottom of the day

971
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,423
So like

972
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,239
You be like approximately like two pieces of matzah stack

973
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
On top of each other

974
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
That sounds

975
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
Approximately that

976
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
Oh my God I'm so

977
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,895
Does it smell good in vanilla

978
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,431
Yes it does

979
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:49,087
So I wanted I want you to turn one of the burners of your stove on until the flame is a little

980
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,135
Little bit greater than

981
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
A lighter

982
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,671
Like a Zippo lighter

983
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
Oh okay

984
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,767
And then

985
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,071
Set the dish on top of their

986
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:02,655
You're going to leave the dish on there for a little bit less than the time at

987
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,935
Takes to brush your teeth

988
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,519
And what you're looking for is that the batter

989
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,799
Begins to set

990
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,823
In the bottom of the day

991
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
You got it

992
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,127
You got it all right here we go

993
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,407
So when's it set

994
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,711
You could pull it off the burner

995
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,295
Aha and now you're going to add the bear

996
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:25,183
Okay now we're going to add another stress ball amount of sugar over the berry

997
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
Okay

998
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,535
And now you get to top it all off with

999
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
With the rest of the batter

1000
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,143
Just sort of drizzling

1001
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:37,983
Okay now you can just throw it into the oven

1002
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,007
For how long

1003
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,543
It's going to be in there

1004
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,823
For about

1005
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,127
Aztlan

1006
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,151
As a movie

1007
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,967
So approximately as long as

1008
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,295
An episode of

1009
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
Bones

1010
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,111
Yes I would say it's

1011
00:47:54,367 --> 00:48:00,255
Greater than the length of an episode of Bones without the commercials and the length of an episode of Bones with

1012
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,583
Somewhere in there

1013
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
God I really miss Beau

1014
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
Noted

1015
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:14,079
All right it's it's in there

1016
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,919
Alex are you going to

1017
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
Who are you going to

1018
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
Eat this classroom

1019
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,039
I'm probably going to eat it with my wife and kids

1020
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:28,415
Which which I'm super excited about cuz my son loves dessert

1021
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,695
More than anything in the world

1022
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,511
And your children approximately how old are they

1023
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,327
Harvey is older than

1024
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,631
A wheel of Parmesan

1025
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,703
I don't know how old wheels of Parmesan are

1026
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,263
Is about as old

1027
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,823
It's a little bit

1028
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,639
Find the length of a typical

1029
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,663
American

1030
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:55,295
He's he's he's greater than

1031
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
A wheel of Parmesan

1032
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:08,863
Has it been approximately the number of minutes in

1033
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,887
In a Bones episode

1034
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,447
I'm going to take the clafouti

1035
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,543
I'm going to show you what it looks like it's literally just came out of the oven

1036
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,103
Okay I can't wait to see it

1037
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,639
Interstate now

1038
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,967
I would say that it approximately looks like

1039
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,527
Did your local skatepark

1040
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,063
You know how there's like sort of

1041
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,111
Hills and Valleys

1042
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,975
That are sort of oddly placed in order to maximize like grinding into jumping and leaping

1043
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,279
That's I think what it looks like right now

1044
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,863
The rising in the following is a natural part of the process

1045
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,399
So you've done that part right

1046
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,447
I think you've done a great job

1047
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:48,543
I'm really excited for what you've made it's not a booty

1048
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:56,479
It's closer to like a souffle pancake or a Dutch baby pancake but unfortunately it does look like

1049
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:01,599
It's less brown than the Villa golden deliciousness that I had hoped

1050
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,951
4 but I still think it will be delicious and I think you should taste it

1051
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,231
I wish I were there

1052
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
Looks delicious

1053
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,863
It's like eggie

1054
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,399
Kind of yeah

1055
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,191
I feel like it's a success

1056
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,239
All right

1057
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:21,311
