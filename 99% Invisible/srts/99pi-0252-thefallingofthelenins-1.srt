32
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
The night of December 8th

33
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
2013

34
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,280
A huge crowd appeared on a tree line Boulevard in downtown Kiev

35
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
The capital of Ukraine

36
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,656
The crowd was there to watch as a statue in the boulevard was

37
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
Pulled down by a crane

38
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,984
That's producer Julia Barton

39
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,776
It's a pretty large statue

40
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
A little more than 11 ft

41
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
Talk

42
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
Odesza topples to the ground

43
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
The Crowd Goes Wild

44
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,552
The toppled statue was Vladimir Lenin

45
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,136
The communist leader who started the revolution that created the Soviet Union

46
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,696
Of which Ukraine was once apart

47
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,536
The sculpture had shown Lennon striding into a breezy future

48
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072
One that just

49
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
Barely Ripple his marbles soup

50
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
But on the night of December 8th

51
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
2013

52
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,544
This linen was no longer striding into a breezy future

53
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
He was lying on the cold concrete

54
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
As protesters

55
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
Continued to abuse him

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,224
They was just shouting that

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
You know what that's

58
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
This

59
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
Monument need to be ruined

60
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,112
And The Tease Aquila

61
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
And

62
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,464
It's not the place for sluggish it here anymore

63
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
I'm Thai

64
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,328
Ukrainians are owners of this land

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,888
Ukrainian photojournalist Alexander to Chin

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
Rush to the scene that

67
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
He and his colleagues kept a camera steady

68
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
Is the drama unfolded around

69
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:57,408
Their footage ended up in a documentary they later made called All Things Ablaze

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,992
It shows people taking sledgehammers the woman's torso

71
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,600
The camera lingers on one man in a shiny tracksuit

72
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
Spits on his hand

73
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
Crosses himself three times

74
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,488
And start to walking away with all his might

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
But at some point

76
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,608
Just an old guy in a black coat emerges from the crowd

77
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
Adjust wraps himself around linen

78
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Chest

79
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,264
Yeah she was trying to protect him with his own body

80
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
And did he say anything

81
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:30,432
He was saying that it's it's not right it's not correct

82
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
Please don't do that

83
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,040
It's

84
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
Warszawa

85
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
Barbarism barbarism

86
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,232
Yeah another man

87
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,280
Hats the old communist on the back

88
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,816
A little threatening lie

89
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,472
He saved this old communist sympathizer

90
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,776
You're the last one in the whole city

91
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
The whole country understand

92
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
When you die things in this country will get better

93
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,968
Eventually some Volunteers in reflective vest

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,272
Leave the old man away by the arms

95
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
His hat is gone

96
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
He looks ready to fight

97
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,232
The protesters this old man in the Statue of Lenin represent old Ukraine

98
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
One that is associated with the Soviet Union and with Russia

99
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,119
The protesters saw themselves as New York

100
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Independent

101
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
And allied with the European Union

102
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,263
The same protest that brought down that Lenin statue

103
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,311
Eventually brought about a new government

104
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
That new government

105
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,919
Has been trying to get rid of all kinds

106
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
Physical reminders of communism

107
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
And Russia

108
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Lenin statue

109
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,551
Names of streets

110
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
In town

111
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
But it hasn't always been easy to get rid of these thing

112
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
Logistically or politically

113
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
Because it erases apart history

114
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,535
That is still important to some Ukrainian

115
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,119
People in a different parts of Ukraine conceived its history difference

116
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
That's Katarina trnava

117
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,703
She's a legal editor at

118
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
Vox Ukraine. Org

119
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
Website for Ukrainian news and policy in Dallas

120
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,103
Where someone it is a history of Oppression

121
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
It is the history of unity

122
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,319
Having your talent being developed under the Soviet rule in the process of industrialization

123
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,903
To understand all this we should zoom out a bit

124
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,719
Ukraine is a country about the size of Texas

125
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,511
Is bordered by Russia to the east

126
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
And the rest of Europe to the West

127
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,655
Between two superpowers the European Union and Russia

128
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,519
A lot of people in the US still refer to Ukraine as the Ukraine

129
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
Like the Midwest or the South

130
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
A region

131
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
Drives Ukrainian crazy

132
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711
But there is a reason for the mistake

133
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,575
For centuries Ukraine was a region controlled by more powerful entities around it

134
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
And the word Ukraine literally means Borderland

135
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:52,511
In the 1920s much of the territory of Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union

136
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,863
Despite the efforts of a lot of people who wanted it to be an independent country

137
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
In the 1930s

138
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
Millions of ukrainians

139
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Died in a famine

140
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
Installing engineered by

141
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,055
Forcibly taking food from peasants

142
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
Entrapping them into

143
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Starvation

144
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,199
What's the policy of collectivization they would take away the

145
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,807
The possessions of the people that they they would collapse the grain from Farm some people worst

146
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:21,183
Starving many scholars believe stolen did this specifically to Cripple the movement for Ukrainian

147
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
A decade later during World War II

148
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:29,119
Hundreds of thousands of ukrainians especially people in the East near what is now Russia

149
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,679
What ended with the Soviet Red Army

150
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,031
The smaller number of people in the west who wanted an independent Ukraine

151
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,079
Allied themselves with the Nazis

152
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,383
And the Soviet Union and Germany

153
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,199
Both wanted control over Ukrainian territory

154
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,295
The trailer of Ukraine was the treasurer of clashes during the second World War

155
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,879
When was all over even more of Ukraine was part of the USSR

156
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,231
Soviet authorities one of the people of Ukraine to United around the narrative that they had

157
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279
Defeated the Nazis in that communism

158
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
Would help the country rebuild

159
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,007
It was the story about winning the war and coming back

160
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
Victoriously and trading

161
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
To rebuild the country from scratch

162
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
The hard to find

163
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
2

164
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
Relounge the country again

165
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
And it was very hard to

166
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Because they come

167
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
To empty house

168
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Is that all

169
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
The territory of Ukraine was heavily ball

170
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
As part of a campaign team

171
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,303
Unite Ukraine under the banner of communism

172
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,143
The Soviets put statues of the ussr's founding father

173
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
Vladimir Lenin

174
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Everywhere

175
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,823
Ukraine eventually had around 5500 statues of Lenin

176
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,175
In the whole territory of Russia which is 28 times the size of Ukraine

177
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
There were about

178
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
7000 Linens

179
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,295
Apart from covering Ukraine and linens

180
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,855
The Soviet Union did help develop

181
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
End rebuild Ukraine

182
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
In the years after World War II

183
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
Small villages

184
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
Became big industrial cities

185
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:07,167
But the Soviet regime also imprisoned by some estimates around 2 million ukrainians in ghoul

186
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,007
Because the Soviet Union was not a free Society with

187
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
The Free Press

188
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,615
Many people had no idea that kind of oppression was happening

189
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,967
This whole depression and building up labor camps and gulag

190
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:26,367
In the USSR and this information was not disclosed of people didn't have access to that information

191
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
The USSR said

192
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
Everything is fine

193
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,511
As they put up more and more Lenin statues all over Ukraine

194
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,839
Ukraine eventually became the most linen eyes territory

195
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
In the USSR

196
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,471
The chief State TV channel was halfway through its Evening News

197
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,543
When it got the first details of the agreement signed in means

198
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
Quoting from it the anchorwoman announced

199
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
The Soviet Union

200
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
No longer exist

201
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
In 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed

202
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,599
Ukraine became its own separate country and so did Russia

203
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,415
But Russia on onto its Soviet past

204
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,767
Russia after the collapse of the USSR officially announced that it is

205
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Successor of the USSR

206
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,655
It's kind of the same they have the music in the national anthem

207
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
The famous just the words that have

208
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,735
Russia drop the tenets of Communism and embrace capitalism in many ways

209
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,343
But the leadership of the country especially current President Vladimir Putin

210
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,903
Never stop being proud of the Soviet Legacy

211
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,999
Ukraine meanwhile has struggled with its identity

212
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
Since gaining its independence in 1991

213
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:44,447
For a very long time Ukraine was very indecisive I would say in international politics

214
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
With the country Orient East

215
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
Patricia

216
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
Or west

217
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
What's Europe

218
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
It was hard for you created

219
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Completely cut ties

220
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Russia

221
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
One they relied on it

222
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
Charcoal and gas

223
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,783
But also many ukrainians have strong cultural

224
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Connections to Russia

225
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
Ukrainians have a lot of

226
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,159
Relatives living in Russian

227
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,255
Call traits family and its business relationship to because

228
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,095
Boost Nation speak the same language it is very easy to

229
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
To carry out business

230
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
Activities

231
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
For years the country seem to vacillate

232
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,263
Some president of Ukraine lean West towards Europe

233
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
Others oriented e

234
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Toward Russia

235
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,919
And all those Lenin statues and other communist symbols in the built environment

236
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
In Western Ukraine war

237
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
People felt less loyalty

238
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Soviet-era

239
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,063
They got rid of most of them right after Independence

240
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,647
Then the rest of Ukraine they mostly stay put

241
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,463
The wheel to remove them just wasn't there

242
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
And then in 2013

243
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
The pro-russian president

244
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,071
Viktor Yanukovych

245
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:47,167
Tried to back out of a deal to bring Ukraine closer to joining the European Union

246
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
Huge protest broke out

247
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
The tide had turned

248
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,871
Ukrainians were in the street saying they didn't want to be beholden to Russia anymore

249
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,783
These are the same protests that led to the Lenin statue being torn down in Kiev

250
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
The one that you heard at the beginning of the story

251
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,951
But that's not the only statue that came down

252
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,815
People started spontaneously tearing down Lennon's all over Ukraine

253
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
So much so that they had a name for it

254
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Lenin apod

255
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,471
The falling of the lens

256
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,287
In February of 2014

257
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,895
Following days of bloody protests in which more than a hundred protesters were killed

258
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
Viktor Yanukovych

259
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,247
Was forced out of the presidency and fled to Russia

260
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,319
The protesters in Ukraine established a new government

261
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,647
Athena Valentin shocking few days Ukraine

262
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Ultimate

263
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,023
Victorious and arrange the top Rihanna curvage and install a new government

264
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,703
Russian President Vladimir Putin didn't like that Ukraine was turning away from Russia and toward the European Union and in March of

265
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,799
2014 hiexpress stop by taking control of a part of Ukraine called

266
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Crimea

267
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
This morning more unidentified

268
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,991
Pro-russia armed militias patrolling the streets of Crimea capital

269
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,807
Meanwhile hundreds of miles to the east

270
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,391
Russian-backed separatists started fighting the Ukrainian military

271
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
Those battles continue today

272
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
At least 10000 people

273
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
I'm done

274
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,327
By the end of 2014 Ukraine's new government

275
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
Now definitively oriented towards West

276
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,447
Had inherited a country in crisis

277
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,007
You might think linen removal would be at the

278
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
The bottom of their list

279
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
But battles with the separatists

280
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
May the government want to rid its landscape

281
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,687
Once and for all of its Soviet

282
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
Which was

283
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Centennial

284
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Is it

285
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Big furry

286
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
Shuffle symbol

287
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,695
One year after coming to power the new government led by Petro poroshenko

288
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,023
Decided to make the falling of the Lenin's into State policy

289
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,351
His allies in Ukraine parliament passed a package of bills

290
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
It's called decarbonization

291
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,447
Various post-soviet countries had already

292
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,055
In Ukraine these laws did a number of things outlawed communism

293
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
One of which was to ban communist

294
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Symbols

295
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,175
Local authorities had a year

296
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
To get rid of their Linens tattoos

297
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,295
Is there town or streets had communist names

298
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
Those had to be changed to

299
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:19,487
Ukrainians in Hawkins have celebrated the toppling of the monument to former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin

300
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,887
Statue of Soviet dictator Vladimir Lenin has been taken down in the Ukrainian city of another day another Lenin

301
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,703
Monuments pools in Ukraine's war-torn East

302
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,287
Some places in Ukraine Got really creative

303
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,335
It's about complying with the decolonization

304
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:39,455
A factory in Odessa hired a sculptor to refashion the figure of Lenin

305
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
As Darth Vader

306
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,087
Overseeing the removal of all these symbols is a government organization

307
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
Ukrainian is

308
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
Doot of national remembrance

309
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
National Park

310
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,535
Deputy head of Ukrainian Institute of national remembrance

311
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,119
Spark told me it's not easy to go from totalitarianism

312
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
To democracy

313
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,703
That's a very complicated person.

314
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
Coming from a totalitarian

315
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
Society Apso democratic

316
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,663
It's also not easy to raise communism from the built environment

317
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
The Soviets made things to last

318
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,295
Are long Bridges lined with wrought-iron Hammers and sickles

319
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,879
Their whole Forest planted in such a way that if you fly over

320
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,695
You see the Cyrillic initials for the USSR

321
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
And there are neighborhoods

322
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
That do this to

323
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
A set of building

324
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,703
Les Schwab do top in such a way Seresto construct

325
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
Letters of USS all letters

326
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
Wasn't

327
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,103
That's one, symbol that may have to stay for now

328
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,711
Truck says the process of decolonization isn't just about removal

329
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,015
It's also meant to help ukrainians

330
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
Learn their own history

331
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
Which is why in many cases

332
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,183
The Institute of national remembrance has suggested that Town's revert

333
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
To the names they had beef

334
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
Before the Soviets change them

335
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,583
This is actually what happened to Katrina donovitz home

336
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,983
Downtown Institute of national remembers made a proposition to restore

337
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
For the historical name of the town

338
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
In 2016

339
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,103
The name of her town was restored

340
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
To come and skia

341
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,735
Is routed back to 1750 when there were calls.

342
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Settlements

343
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,087
The Soviet name of Katarina's town

344
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,111
That it had up and

345
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Till 26

346
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
16

347
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,951
Was nip Road erosion

348
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,047
Can you put the bank and it's absolutely unpronounceable event for native

349
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:34,399
Enjoy of this town the majority of people just wanted to keep the old unpronounced

350
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
Soviet name

351
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,287
Cuz she says it was just a tiny village before the Soviets set up a metallurgical plant there

352
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,591
City owes its very existence

353
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
To the Soviet history

354
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,199
It has become a town and has become so big because of the

355
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
Soviet rule

356
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,783
So it does make sense that there was a big part of

357
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
Population that opposed to change

358
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,391
But in the end it didn't matter

359
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
People wanted

360
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
To keep the name

361
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,999
The town was named for a prominent Soviet figure

362
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
Felix dzerzhinsky

363
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
Who founded the Soviet Secret Police

364
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,423
And the new law mandated the town's name be changed

365
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,519
What local communities do not have is a choice to keep the Soviet

366
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
That's Tariq Serie Lamar

367
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,687
A historian of Ukraine and Eastern Europe at Columbia University in New York

368
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
This type of

369
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
As I would say

370
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
Trali Hampstead attempt

371
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,391
Dealing versus Orbit Legacy is actually producing

372
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
Some of the Soviet leaders

373
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
Some of the habits

374
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
What's up doing census always way

375
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,095
And this is a major criticism of the decolonization Ma

376
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:41,983
That Ukraine is being kind of authoritarian about separating from their authoritarian past

377
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,823
Not just because people don't get a say in whether they change the name of their town

378
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,663
But because the laws also make it illegal to join the Communist Party

379
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,223
Or display any kind of Soviet symbols

380
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,759
Or to deny the quote

381
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
Criminal nature

382
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,367
Of the Soviet regime

383
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,743
Criminal matrons a criminal nature is not defined so we're not even sure about what we're not

384
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
Allowed to deny requests

385
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,655
Scholars we spoke to for the story opposed these parts of the decolonization laws

386
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,495
The ones that seem to limit freedom of speech and freedom of expression

387
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,567
I never believed the laws too ambiguous

388
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,711
It's unclear if for example wearing a t-shirt with Karl Marx on it could make you criminally liable

389
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:32,159
Since the formal process of removing communist symbols began in 2014

390
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,231
More than 50000 objects have been renamed

391
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
This includes cities

392
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
Towns Villages streets

393
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
Squares and Parks

394
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,727
And more than 2,000 monuments and memorials have been taken down or modified

395
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:50,079
In general these changes have been hardest on Ukraine's older population

396
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,383
The people who lived under Soviet rule

397
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,455
Who didn't understand how bad it was for some people

398
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,783
Because there wasn't free press or freedom in Academia

399
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,367
Extent of the repression was hidden from the General Public

400
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,927
Some ukrainians are now just finding out

401
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,487
Add millions of people died because of Stalin

402
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
And that Millions more were put into goulash

403
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
These Notions of a

404
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,607
Prescience the facts

405
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Statistics

406
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,911
Come to them as a

407
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
Big Revelation right now

408
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,519
Denial

409
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,103
There's been a lot of change in Ukraine in the past couple of decades

410
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
And it's still volatile

411
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,455
Over a million people have been displaced

412
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:32,319
And some Eastern parts of the country are locked in semi-permanent conflict with Russia

413
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,927
You you leaving this permanent condition of not knowing what's going to happen next and what day

414
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
That's why

415
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
It is easier for someone who has been

416
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
And I living under the Soviet troops feeling

417
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Tell Jake about it

418
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,263
Donovan said that for now many ukrainians have shifted away from wanting to be allied with Russia and toward one

419
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
Wanting to be allied with the EU

420
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,639
But Russia still exerts a lot of political influence

421
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
And there were pro-russia forces within the country

422
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,015
Cause trouble for a long time

423
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,367
Despite feeling like some parts of the decolonization laws are too ambiguous

424
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,463
Joinable thinks that removing communist symbols in public spaces

425
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:15,071
Is an important step as Ukraine continues to develop as an independent nation

426
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,095
I think it is

427
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,447
I think it is because I think it should have been done earlier

428
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,495
It should be understood it's never easy

429
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,311
Suggest that there would always be a certain percent of the

430
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,127
The population would strongly oppose that change

431
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,247
It's Tricky for Ukraine

432
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,783
For any country really

433
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,671
To figure out how to leave behind symbols of Oppression without completely denying and erasing the past

434
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,999
In Lithuania which was also part of the USSR

435
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,351
They threw a lot of their Lenin Stalin and Karl Marx statues into one Park

436
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Gruta Spa

437
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
Unofficially called

438
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
Stalin's world

439
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,727
And the Park is open for visitors

440
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,543
So those people who feel you know

441
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,943
Very sentimental about the whole Communist party and communist issues they will continue to come there to visit and enjoy

442
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
View of the big Landing statues

443
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,295
In the multiple variations arise

444
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,623
Ukraine doesn't have any such Park

445
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:15,231
But there have been some efforts to acknowledge the existence and loss of these monuments

446
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,863
For a week in 2016 a group called permission to put a temporary installation

447
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:27,007
Around the empty pedestal in Kiev that used to hold the same linen we heard being toppled at the beginning of this

448
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Story

449
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,103
The installation consisted simply of metal stairs

450
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:35,199
That people could have send to stand on a platform placed over the pedestal

451
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,759
And then descend on the other side

452
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,343
In the process they could see the world from Lenin's perspective

453
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
And of course

454
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
Take a selfie

455
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,255
Ukrainian curator who helped organize the installation says

456
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Quote

457
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,839
A way of asking what a monument is for

458
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
And everyone decides for themselves

459
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,191
That's because she says

460
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
Becoming ization starts first

461
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
