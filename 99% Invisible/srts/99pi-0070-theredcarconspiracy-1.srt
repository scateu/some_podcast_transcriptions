19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,888
I'm Roman Mars

20
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,936
And this is Eric molinsky

Thai America

22
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,800
Eric is an independent producer in New York City Brooklyn of course like

23
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,104
Most public radio producers here

24
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,760
But before Brooklyn Eric spent 10 years in Los Angeles

25
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,552
In the story

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,464
La had asked you know amazing transportation system called the red car

27
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,536
And it was a trolley that covered the entire city

28
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,888
And then after World War II either Ford or GM bought the red car

29
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
How to dismantle

30
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,496
And then built this Kino horrible freeway system that created the

31
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
Sprawling gridlock of today

32
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
What the hell

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,408
Shimmering cement running from here

34
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,456
Slow

35
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,248
Traffic jam

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
And

37
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,856
You're the first the story I thought well.

38
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,440
That sounds familiar it must be true I feel like

39
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,512
That's because it's the plot of Who Framed Roger rabbit

40
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,144
Human

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,704
Scheme that Christopher Lloyd reveals at the end of the movie

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,336
Nobody's going to try this lousy

43
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040
I bought the red car so I couldn't

44
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
This isn't totally ridiculous remember the plot of Chinatown where I've Los Angeles mobile was stealing water from Northern California

45
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
That actually happened

46
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,008
Garrett Jacobs Chinatown

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
As I learned more about the history of LA

48
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,200
I learned that the red car was actually not the victim of a massive

49
00:02:59,456 --> 00:02:59,968
Conspiracy

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,784
The red car actually was the conspiracy

51
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,136
The red car helped create the sprawl in the gridlock

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
Understand how this all came about

53
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
Where to go way back

54
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
The mid-nineteenth century

55
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:17,632
A boy named Henry Huntington was born into a middle-class family in Upstate New York

56
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
What's 3 as a very wealthy uncle

57
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
Name Carlos

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
Chuggington

59
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
Carlos has no key

60
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,800
Any sort of latches onto his nephew

61
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,360
And I mean I assume you must see something in Henry

62
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,688
Thanks is kicking me molded into a business panties right

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
Antecollis takes

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
Little Henry under his wing

65
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
Shazam everything about the family business which is

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Railroads

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
Johnson 1900

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
Carlos.

69
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:46,560
Henry thinks he's going to inherit the company Southern Pacific doesn't want another Huntington in charge so

70
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
Henry's out

71
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,168
Consolation prize which is $50

72
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
Back then was up

73
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
You like $400 today

74
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
He takes his cash

75
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,592
Los Angeles

76
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,432
The city of Los Angeles really shouldn't exist

77
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,320
The LA River with a mess and it was so prone to flooding would actually change its location on the map

78
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
The only decent Harbor is Long Beach but San Diego has a center of Commerce

79
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,815
Disconnected flatland but where many people saw the desert

80
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,143
Robber barons of the late 19th century saw something else

81
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
A blank slate

82
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,007
So the modern city of Los Angeles

83
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
As we know it would created

84
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:34,431
A sort of like a counterweight to San Francisco which was liberal even back then it very strong union

85
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
Anelli wooden open shop

86
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,039
The businessman like Henry Huntington had free reign

87
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:44,671
And he starts by purchasing the biggest transportation system of the city which of the Los Angeles Railway

88
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
How do I sound

89
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
Larry

90
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
Incorporated into a new company called

91
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
Pacific Electric

92
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,119
I talked to a bunch of historians about this including a bill Friedrich

93
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,143
Text to grab him off and

94
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,727
I have this vague recollection of

95
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
Streetcar running up and down the main

96
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
Drag which is Brand Boulevard

97
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
And I think

98
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,895
I think I can remember the Bell

99
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
The bell ringing

100
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
Really would it sound like

101
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,783
Ding ding

102
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,343
Britax actually wrote a book about Henry Huntington

103
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,975
The key to Henry Huntington's operation was that this was before lot of regulation in the the area so

104
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Henry

105
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,607
Pretty much decided where development Whitaker by Building A street car line out to the area

106
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
Just ahead of development

107
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,959
And most frequently he was building the streetcar lines

108
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Out to

109
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
Where you own the land

110
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
Soda put this in modern terms

111
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:39,967
The red car with kind of like the Kindle Amazon loses money on the Kindle because they want you to use this

112
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
E-reader with a portal to buy lots of

113
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,551
You know bigger stuff on their website

114
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,367
Answer the red car was a portal

115
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,695
To get you to buy other bigger stuff from Henry Huntington

116
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
Like your entire life

117
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
He never really made money with

118
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
The Pacific

119
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,863
Took people out to

120
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
Who is subdivisions

121
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
Or he sold them land

122
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,007
Frequent seldom water he controlled some water companies

123
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
He also

124
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Established

125
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
An electric operate

126
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,383
Ocean called the Pacific light and power come

127
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,455
It was essentially set up to

128
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,527
Provide electricity to his trolley cars but he ended up selling like

129
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
Electricity to the city of Los Angeles

130
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,879
Now even back then this was not the

131
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,439
This is usual there are lots of other streetcar developer

132
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
But they're much smaller

133
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,767
And the frequent went bankrupt

134
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,095
Other developers own land and they build a trolley out

135
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
To some land

136
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,679
But not the immense amount of land at Huntington

137
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
So

138
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,519
He deserve a complete package coming down

139
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,359
So from 1904 to 1913

140
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,199
Huntington opens 500 new subdivisions every year

141
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,551
He controls more than 900 red cars are more than 1100 miles

142
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,927
Track that's about 25% more track mileage than New York City has today

143
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
100 years later

144
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:59,327
No I mean historically American cities grow organically and Rings you know out of a downtown

145
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,167
In Huntington really forces Los Angeles to expand

146
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
Outward it twice the race

147
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:11,615
And I think that really weak in Downtown LA because he was creating these little downtown's along as trolley routes

148
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
So

149
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
I know you think he's crazy Empire

150
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
Trains he's got the electricity he's got the land

151
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
Water

152
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
Only need it now

153
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Were people

154
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Back then you know

155
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,951
There's a lot of reasons not to like cities and they were dirty they were crowded

156
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Dangerous

157
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,535
In Los Angeles was going to be very different

158
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
Kind of city that was the dream

159
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Huntington and Harry

160
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,679
Chandler and all these other side of LA powerbroker

161
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
When is media blitz

162
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,055
And during the winter that would blanket the Midwest with advertisement

163
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,383
Los Angeles is a paradise full of Orange

164
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
Trees the climate will

165
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
Cure your asthma

166
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
You can go surfing and it surfing was actually a relatively unknown sport until Henry Huntington hired a Hawaiian Surfer

167
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
George free

168
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,927
The surf along Huntington Beach

169
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:02,047
And it worked I mean for a while Long Beach was known as Iowa by the Sea cuz how many islands

170
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,119
But eventually the dream when bus

171
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,447
So now remember Pacific electric is designed to lose money at

172
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
Portal 2 Ending

173
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,751
Is Real Estate another company

174
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
Is it a border Pacific electric is not happy about this

175
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
In the meantime

176
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,711
The red car is becoming a threat to Southern Pacific Railroad which was you know the company that

177
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
Huntington thought he was going to inherit from his uncle

178
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,343
Southern Pacific wants to buy Pacific Electric

179
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,879
Honeyman says no

180
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
His own board overrules him

181
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,023
He's forced to make a deal and once again his power and his Ambitions are

182
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
Cut short

183
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,119
But Henry Huntington gets the last laugh

184
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,423
Hanna pretty weird way

185
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
Because his uncle's Fortune was

186
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,287
Split between him and his on Arabella

187
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
So Huntington marries his aunt

188
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
And consolidates the family fortune

189
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
Now it's actually not

190
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,783
Quite as icky as it sounds because they were not related by blood

191
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
She was his uncle second wife

192
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
Yeah

193
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,047
Huntington actually lived happily ever after

194
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,375
When is well that is on his aunt / wife

195
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,983
And he used to Los Angeles to create Huntington Gardens

196
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,567
The Huntington Library he dies in 1920s

197
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
And

198
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
I don't know if you knew yet

199
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,223
But it was clear already to historians

200
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Looking back

201
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
Set the red car

202
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Was doomed

203
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,791
Even though the overall track mileage rivaled New York

204
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:43,167
The red car wasn't comprehensive enough to go everywhere you needed to go by red car alone

205
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,751
Starting to come poorly-maintained I mean people started calling them

206
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Slums on wheels

207
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,151
The big Turning Point comes in 1926 the year before Huntington died

208
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
Southern Pacific

209
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,991
Now owns Huntington Pacific Electric

210
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,599
Offers this master plan to build Subways and elevated trains

211
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
All around

212
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Downtown LA

213
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,743
Mississippi pay for by the taxpayer so it's put up for a public referendum

214
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
Is a lot of money spent

215
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
A lot of advertising spend on both sides just like

216
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
Referendums today

217
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
And the voters reject the plan

218
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,055
People just didn't like feather Pacific they had meddled in California politics for so long

219
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
Did they called it

220
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
The octave

221
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,247
Okay so now remember the original sort of conspiracy

222
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,063
Theory that the car companies bought up a red car and

223
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Tore them down in Belton

224
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
The freeways

225
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,927
So there was a subsidiary of General Motors

226
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
It's called National City

227
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,559
And they did by Charlie cars and they converted them into

228
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Bus routes

229
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
And their people the time that.

230
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:50,495
It was a conspiracy this was in this conspiracy that suddenly you know people discovered 50 years later

231
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,079
But the fact is Pacific electric was doing the same thing to the wrong trolley

232
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,199
As freeways became the norm in the red car became a thing of the past

233
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:04,063
You can see how a conspiracy theory could become cemented into the public imagination

234
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,623
So when I first saw map of the red car lines

235
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
I actually thought it was an early map of

236
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
The freeways

237
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,255
Which makes sense because of the route that people are using to get around

238
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,815
And some cases like the Cahuenga pass

239
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,655
Trains were actually dismantle to make way for the Hollywood freeway

240
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Santa Monica Boulevard

241
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,287
Paved over a trolley route and sometimes you know when I was heading to the 405 I actually

242
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
Drive over

243
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Phantom tracks

244
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:33,503
Ellie's first freeway the Arroyo Seco Parkway which connects downtown to Pasadena opened in 1940

245
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
A few years later

246
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,111
City planners proposed another plan for elevated railroads

247
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
That was rejected by the city council

248
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,999
The last Red Car ran in 1961

249
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,583
And you have to think it was in a way a victim of its own success

250
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,959
Henry Huntington's goal was to connect his far-flung properties and create a decentralized city

251
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
That you need a mass transit solution

252
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
To get around

253
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
The problem was

254
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
He couldn't provide it

255
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,943
Overtime La was so spread out

256
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Headed over Tok

257
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
What the red car

258
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
Was capable of servicing

259
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,135
I like to imagine you know if it's 1960 and I'm driving along the 10 freeway

260
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
I mean

261
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:18,559
Yeah I'm sure there's traffic but it must have been pretty smooth cuz I'm in the freeways that exist now we're the same freeways back

262
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Then

263
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
But don't for a much smaller population

264
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
So they must have seemed like

265
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
A really impressive solution.

266
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
The time

267
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,383
And today angelinos can appreciate the great solution of their highway system

268
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
4 hours

269
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
Hours

270
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,295
Hour an hour an hour an hour and hour

271
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
In-N-Out hours

272
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,727
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Eric molinsky with help from Sam Greenspan and me Roman Mars

273
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
It's a project of 91 points

274
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:04,383
Local public radio kalw in San Francisco and the American Institute of Art

275
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,015
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

276
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,599
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

277
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
If

278
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:21,023
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

279
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,119
Another

280
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,911
Technology talk to us

281
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,215
It is a creation of Sonic trash

282
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,031
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

283
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,615
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

284
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,663
To make them more human

285
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,759
Turn the living room lights on

286
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
Okay

287
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,343
Dim the living room lights to 50

288
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
80%

289
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Okay

290
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:54,303
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

291
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,119
Makes for a much more natural experience

292
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
Turn the living room lights on

293
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,263
Dim the living room lights to 50%

294
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:10,687

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

317
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,759
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

318
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,111
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

320
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,767
Actually if I'm being honest

321
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:07,167
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of thing a few days ago Wesley Stern

322
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,495
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

323
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,823
Was found dead in my private gym

324
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:20,223
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had some

325
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
Nothing to do with it

326
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
Now

327
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
