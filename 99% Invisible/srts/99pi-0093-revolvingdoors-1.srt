The Story Goes Like This

21
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,848
And keep in mind with all these words and stories when they sound a little too much like stories

22
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,408
They're probably not completely true but anyway

23
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
The Story Goes Like This

24
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,040
Theophilus van kannel hated chivalry

25
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,880
There's nothing you despise more than trying to walk in or out of a building

26
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
And locking horns with some other man in a game of horse

27
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Ufirst

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,888
And more than that socially mandated deference to other men

29
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
Theophilus Van canal

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
Hated opening doors

31
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
For women

32
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:51,360
And Sophie opolis band Canal or po4 short took a German Innovation from 1881

33
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
The chew on a lute

34
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,944
Door without draft of air

35
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,832
He made some improvements to the design in an 1888 movie award an American patent for the improved revolving door

36
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,392
The first one was installed in Times Square in

37
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
1899

38
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
That's our producer Sam Greenspan

39
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,792
Bent Nails improve revolving door at three compartments

40
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:14,912
And weather stripping to ensure an energy-efficient fit inside the door frame is eating 88

41
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
Patent states that quote

42
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,312
It is perfectly noiseless in its operation and effectually prevents the entrance of wind

43
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
No rain or dust

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
Either when it's closed

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
Or when persons are passing

46
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,528
And as a bonus and I liked any chance of social interaction that one might have

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
Well entering or exiting a building

48
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,416
The motto of Theo van canals revolving door company

49
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
Was always open

50
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
Always closed

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,328
And so for the past hundred plus years we have had the solution

52
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,864
Nikki dust and Noise

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,936
And rain and sleet and snow from entering our building

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
And yet

55
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,776
The likelihood that you'll actually use it

56
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
Is Barry

57
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
Very low

58
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,128
Problem is that people don't use revolving doors

59
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
Because they're happy or

60
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
They feel like they make it

61
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
Stuck in them

62
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
Compartments terrified

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,344
And this shouldn't be a big surprise when you're approaching a revolving door

64
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
It's always hard to tell

65
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,720
How are you going to have to push it to get it going and if it is already moving

66
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,768
It does right

67
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,328
And there's also the anxiety of getting a limb caught

68
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,632
Or maybe your bag and it's all mad

69
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:22,496
If you're walking with someone and talking to him is a little bit bigger of a revolving door

70
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288
Usually get in there with him

71
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
Close

72
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
PU 2nd semester

73
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Depress

74
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
And if you read Alan Moore's Watchmen

75
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,392
You may remember that detail about how some of the superheroes are wary of catesby

76
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,976
One time there Caped Crusader colleague dollar bill

77
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:49,376
Got his tape caught in a revolving door and was dust and mobilize a bank robber approached him

78
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,936
Man shot him in the head Point Blank

79
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,264
As long as you can tell if you need to

80
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Bush

81
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
Pulled open the door

82
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
And that subjects

83
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Could be up

84
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,152
Whole episode in of itself

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
Swinging Doors

86
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
Adjust easy

87
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
And most of us unlock van canal

88
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
Are well-adjusted human being to actually do try

89
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,904
To open the door for each other

90
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
Anytime you have a stream of

91
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
People walking together and

92
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:20,607
The first person that line open swing-door the rest tend to follow so this is Andrew

93
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,423
My name is Andrew Shea I'm a graphic designer Rider

94
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,775
Anderson station with revolving doors started when he was in grad

95
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
I was in my teeth

96
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
Tucson

97
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Designing person

98
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
Change

99
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
And a good friend of mine was visiting

100
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,735
You found out what I was doing and he's going to revolving doors and he's like

101
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
If you want to design for social change

102
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
I wish you would get people to use

103
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Use revolving doors

104
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
That was his challenge to

105
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,183
Andrew dobin to the literature on revolving doors

106
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
Which was shockingly

107
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
Quite slow

108
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
But he did come across

109
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
Study of

110
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
Study done by MIT

111
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
But you was focused on sustainability

112
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
It was the only resource like

113
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
I can find out there though

114
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Authoritative

115
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
And their impact

116
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
I had a lot of math in it

117
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
I kind of avoided the math because

118
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,527
But you don't really need to see the math understand the logic

119
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:15,135
The basic idea of how a revolving door

120
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
Never open a can

121
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,975
Exchange of air from the outside

122
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,559
How do people move through the revolving door they don't open it then we are that week

123
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
Through is either the

124
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Sakelaris

125
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Transformer

126
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
People on the chambers

127
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
Of the revolving door

128
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
Or whatever leaks around weather stripping

129
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
That's Dan wasilowski

130
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,335
One of the authors on the revolving doors.

131
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,895
Back when he was a grad student at MIT

132
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:43,295
He works on a project studying people's behavior with respect to revolving doors and the Energy savings associated with

133
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
With using revolving doors

134
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
In large building

135
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,183
And in some ways it's a study that will not leave him alone

136
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
We were not the first people to contact

137
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Packing for an

138
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
I don't understand it you know I've got like 20 review publication to Material Science and Engineering and I'll what do I have like

139
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
Constant Contact about

140
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
I turn paper I did

141
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
8 years ago

142
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,639
Anyway Dan did a bunch of signs that sounds like the Escalade key associated with all the water vapor that is

143
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,919
In that material

144
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
We didn't really give you enough contacts understand that little bit

145
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,831
But here's the result there's a time was more are exchanged when you use the

146
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:22,463
Swing door then when using revolving door air

147
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Spencer

148
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,047
Death and Russia again the designer in New York

149
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
And this factoid really resonated with me

150
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,727
Which makes total sense because opening a swinging door is like tearing a hole in a building

151
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,775
All that heat or air condition

152
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Leaks out

153
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:41,407
And the building has to kick into high gear to make up for that temperature and humidity fluctuation

154
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,807
Dan waslaski and his team observed by building on MIT campus that had both revolving doors and Swinging Doors

155
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
And found that the revolving-door usage

156
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
Sad and about

157
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
25%

158
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
The team realized that

159
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
In addition to conserving energy and helping the environment

160
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:03,167
They can also save MIT more than $7,500 annually if everyone just use the revolving door in this one building

161
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
And

162
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,055
They found the kid raised revolving-door usage at that building to 60 or 70%

163
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
What system simple signage

164
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
And even though the MIT study

165
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,687
What's on in Boston and Andrew was in New York

166
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,991
It seemed like a pretty transposal data set

167
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,135
To all this inspired Andrew Shea in New York City decide to take up his friends challenge back from when he was in grad school

168
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:28,255
And see what some simple observation and signage could do for one building in New York

169
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
That building was Columbia University

170
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,887
It was the applied sciences building at the brand new building

171
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,703
Three sets of Swinging Doors and three sets of revolving doors

172
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
At the one end

173
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
Entry point of this bill

174
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,103
Andrew started by just watching the building I spent probably altogether about

175
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
2 months

176
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
Once a week

177
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Tuesday Mornings

178
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
Some of those weeks I was there for

179
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
For twice a week 2

180
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
I watch people

181
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
In the building and counted

182
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
And he counted

183
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
For about 20 hours in a 2 month period

184
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
I just never that only

185
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
28% of people reviews

186
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
Using the revolving

187
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
So my first invention was

188
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Is chest tube

189
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Create a bear

190
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Took eight and a half

191
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Depay 11-piece

192
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
The paper I wrote for Elise

193
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Simply

194
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Please use revolving doors

195
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:15,359
Yeah that factoid about revolving doors exchanging 8 times less air than Swinging Doors

196
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Very

197
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
Curly taper

198
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
It cost 50% of

199
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
People

200
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
Two then go ahead and use revolve

201
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,831
So that's a 30-point and Grace

202
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,855
It was a thirty percent

203
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
And that of course

204
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
I wanted to know how it go

205
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
Get that number even higher

206
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
May 2nd

207
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
Can sign the shape of an arrow

208
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,071
And this era was smaller than the first time

209
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,911
But then revolving-door you said actually fell five points from his previous attack

210
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
To 53%

211
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,567
So Andrew treatment larger and he also made it mask Columbia University's visual ID

212
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
Columbia has like a light

213
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
Blue and dark blue

214
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
Color palette and their branding

215
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
So my Hope was that The Branding would help

216
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
People

217
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
Connect with it more and

218
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
And taken more seriously

219
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
And the fact that 71% of people

220
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
End up using the revolver

221
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
As result of that

222
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
71%

223
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,791
That's up 43 points and where he started

224
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
Twenty Eight percent

225
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,935
Here at 99 piht we were curious to find out if that could happen here in the Bay Area

226
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:18,335
Turn Avery truffelman to go stick out of building in Downtown Oakland

227
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,991
Text Evan

228
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,111
Mrs. Avery in sand in the observation stage

229
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,927
The residual scientist part of me has to remind you here

230
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:37,279
All the data sets were talking about today are very small so I understand that

231
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,839
But everyone's observations are aligned

232
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,655
Given the choice revolving doors just

233
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:48,543
Part that popular so far and how we doing

234
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,871
Forever swinging 04 revolving

235
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
Birthday

236
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,991
Nobody is using revolving doors

237
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,295
And when someone has a revolving door

238
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,623
It was notable

239
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,439
Market one

240
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
Revolving door

241
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,591
After a half-hour they tallied up the results

242
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
Crank It Up

243
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:30,271
Tell me to 259 people use swinging doors for people use revolving door

244
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,319
In a 30-minute.

245
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
Okay

246
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:42,559
These are the signs designed by Andrew Shay is an arrow that says please use revolving door

247
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:47,423
The Exchange 8 times less air

248
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:54,335
None of the people using revolving doors were watching

249
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,895
See what happens

250
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Batman

251
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,575
And uses the revolving door

252
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,391
Another guy

253
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,999
Directions

254
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
They're already

255
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,655
Increasing the revolving-door traffic flow

256
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,239
It doubled in less than 5 minutes

257
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
And after another 30 minutes

258
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,871
Teen99 pile the results

259
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919

3 2

262
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,671
Alright how are you

263
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,511
Okay so these are people who use The Swinging Doors even though the sign was on them

264
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:49,887
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45

265
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911

266
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
I-55

267
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
357

268
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,311
And then people who use the revolving door this time or 5:10

269
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,615
1520 2065

270
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
69

271
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
There was no sign that building

272
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Between the hours of

273
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
1230 + 1

274
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
On Monday

275
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,087
Originally it was 1.5

276
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
After

277
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
Define thirty and a half percent

278
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
The people went through the revolving doors

279
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
When there's a sign pointing to them

280
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
First 1.5

281
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
Percent without the time

282
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
Now we did not try testing all the variation

283
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:35,967
So people could have interpreted the signed as intended taking in the message that revolving doors were more energy efficient

284
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,015
And adjusted their behavior accordingly

285
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
Or they could have just thought the swinging door was out of order

286
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,951
Or they could have just noticed something was out of the ordinary and it none of them into using the revolving door

287
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,511
Whatever happened with this much is clear

288
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,327
Putting up an arrow on a door makes people do things

289
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,631
If you want to get people to use a revolving door

290
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
That's a good place to stay

291
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,079
And with that salmon Avery left the lobby of that building and took down the signs

292
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,943
Just like Andrew Shea took down his signs at Columbia then shared his results with the powers-that-be

293
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,735
But nothing ever came of it

294
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:14,111
Dan Wesolowski says that MIT did eventually incorporate some of the basic concepts of his study

295
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
When they created

296
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,207
Sustainability stickers to place on their outer doors

297
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
Although he thought his sons were better

298
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:26,143
Another really powerful way to increase the use of revolving doors is to address the issue in the architecture itself

299
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,727
It turns out they're actually much more effective revolving doors

300
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,519
Like at the Marriott Hotel in Oakland

301
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:37,919
It's much larger is the visual focus of the entrance and it has three dividers which are actually big enough for you to

302
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
To be inside one of them with stranger

303
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,503
If not feel too weird about him

304
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
And they were evolve automatically

305
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
Most importantly

306
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
The doorman won't open The Swinging Doors for you

307
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
Unless I see you're already going for the

308
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231
So if you can't get institutional buy in

309
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,047
Or get a brand-new gigantic revolving door

310
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,399
Andrew Shea has a revolving door action kit that you can download for free

311
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
Take to your local office built

312

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

326
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,399
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

327
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
If

328

340
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,103
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

341
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,919
Makes for a much more natural experience

342
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
