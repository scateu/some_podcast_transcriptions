This is 99% invisible

20
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,800
It's hard to imagine building a city from scratch

21
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:21,664
I just remember the difference between the first time I went there when it was just a

22
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
Little mud hole

23
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,784
Didn't look like it had very much potential at all

24
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,368
Turning a little mud hole into a full-service City

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,952
It takes an incredible amount of resources and people

26
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
And moxie

27
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,024
That's reporter Chloe prasino's

28
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,840
And the other voice you just heard is Milt Ritter

29
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,400
Okay my name is Milt Ritter

30
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
Ritter is a journalist he covered the story of rajneeshpuram which was a city that pops up in Oregon

31
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
In in the 1980s

32
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
Pajamas

33
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
Amazing

34
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
You know the service

35
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,248
Slightly breathtaking driving down into the canyon

36
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,064
After a few years compared to what it was

37
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,904
Rajneeshpuram wasn't trying to be any American city

38
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
They're trying to build a Utopia

39
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
Guided by New Age religious principles

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,632
A place where people of like mind could abandon the mainstream and live their own way

41
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,984
And almost as quickly as this place went from mudhole to City

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
It went from Utopia

43
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
2 dystopian

44
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
There's been a couple of big

45
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,920
Stories that I covered in my lifetime

46
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,344
The eruptions of Mount Saint Helens was one of them and the rajneeshpuram was was the other you know

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
Is that

48
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
Crazy

49
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,744
The story really begins with one man

50
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,072
An Indian Guru named bhagwan shree rajneesh

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,912
His name Loosely translates to serve God

52
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,216
Bhagwan shree rajneesh is a

53
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
Mystic

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
Xiaomi India

55
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:57,408
And he's what we would referred to as an enlightened being that's ma Ananda Sarita

56
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,248
When she was 17 she ran away from home and traveled the world

57
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,552
Looking for what she calls the essence

58
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Thug Life

59
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,672
Sarita found it in India when she met bhagwan shree rajneesh

60
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,000
So of course you've heard of Jesus you've heard of

61
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Buddha

62
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,352
Those would be considered as an enlightened being

63
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,680
Rajneesh was a philosophy Professor come Guru

64
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,752
He synthesized eastern and western spiritual thought

65
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
And Psychotherapy

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,104
And created his own brand of spirituality

67
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
He

68
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
Sad

69
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,992
You cannot make a Dogma out of my word

70
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,576
As far as I could tell his religion was

71
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
A non religion

72
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,464
Here's archival tape of bhagwan shree rajneesh from the Oregon Historical Society

73
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,280
Will be hearing tape from their archive throughout this episode

74
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,096
It is not available

75
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
This

76
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,168
It is a very of living

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,824
The guru's way of life basically trashed all the difficult stuff about religion all the Chastity and abs

78
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
Discipline and shame

79
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:04,480
And instead curated a spirituality of sex laughter and luxury

80
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
Which as you can imagine

81
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,832
Pretty appealing to a lot of paper

82
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,696
Rajneesh had a meditation center in India wear in the 70s

83
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,536
Lots of westerners paid good money for Spiritual instruction

84
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,143
Disciples dressed in red clothing and warlock hats with his photo inside

85
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,751
They called themselves sannyasins kind of spiritual Seeker

86
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,823
They even took new names given to them by the guru

87
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,127
The women were given the title Ma

88
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,735
The men were referred to as Swami disciples

89
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
They claim to be in love

90
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Weather Guru

91
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,903
Iguanas my master and I love him

92
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
She was

93
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
Infinitely

94
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
Graceful

95
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
And in his eyes

96
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
When could

97
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Experience

98
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
Universe

99
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
Passing there

100
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
Troubling alive

101
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,823
Rajneesh was known for a technique called Dynamic meditation

102
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,127
It was intended to quiet the mind

103
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,967
Practitioners close their eyes and concentrate on their breathing

104
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
Send

105
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
Explode

106
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
Scream jump

107
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Kik

108
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Dance

109
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Rise

110
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
Then comes a mantra

111
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
And then

112
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Silence

113
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,887
In 1981 rajneesh was basically kicked out of India

114
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:30,495
There were accusations that is ashram was a business not a religious Institution

115
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,335
Which would mean he owed several million dollars in back taxes

116
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,175
So the guru and his followers started looking for a new home base

117
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,479
And they found it in the United States

118
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:46,111
64000 acre ranch way out in the range country of North Central Oregon

119
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,951
Soon after they arrived Mill Twitter went out to investigate

120
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
When we first

121
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Took that trip

122
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
It was almost like

123
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
Really is

124
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
Is this right you know are we

125
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
Headed in the right

126
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Direction This is

127
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Seems so out

128
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
And it was hard to understand

129
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,871
What a guru from India wood

130
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
What in a place like

131
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,831
The first time I met the garage Nisha was in

132
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,415
The about the second week of July of 1981

133
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
This is Dan dorough

134
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
He was the Wasco County planner at the

135
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,583
And the sannyasins new Ranch was located in his

136
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Jurisdiction

137
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,727
When they first walked into the office there were just three of them at the time

138
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,591
And they were quite pleasant but they definitely word from around there

139
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,663
They were all dressed in red badge strange names

140
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,271
At one point in the conversation Doro asked if they were a religious organization

141
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,343
And the answer was so no absolutely not

142
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,951
We're not a religion we have members who are a ball face

143
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,559
And we just Celebrate life and laughter and

144
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,119
And happiness and we're just simple farmers

145
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Well

146
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,959
That wasn't the case and that wasn't

147
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
1st and 10th

148
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,431
Duro didn't know it yet but the intent of his visitors was to build a mecca for the gurus followers from a

149
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Across the globe

150
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
In order to build anything

151
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,575
Bassani assassins would have to get permits

152
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,879
For every single structure that went up

153
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
A mistake I think that

154
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:30,047
They made ultimately was to not look at the land use laws of Oregon

155
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
Versus other states

156
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,679
Listen to chose Amazon specifically for farming

157
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,775
And they weren't going to be able to get permits for buildings that weren't performing

158
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
But there was a workaround

159
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,735
According to state law if they became their own City they could have their own planning office and issue their own purse

160
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,063
Effectively skirting County oversight and

161
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
The land use laws

162
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,719
In Oregon at the time to incorporate a city all you needed was 150 people

163
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511
Which was easy for the sannyasa

164
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
There really wasn't much to decide

165
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,423
Once I met the basic requirements for incorporation that did move forward

166
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,751
Johnson's name their new city after the guru

167
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
Bhagwan shree rajneesh

168
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
They called it

169
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
Rajneeshpuram

170
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
It seemed like it happened very quickly

171
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,015
That building started springing up

172
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
And

173
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,367
Garden started being planted houses

174
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,951
They scratched out a runway for

175
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
An Airfield

176
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
And they brought in

177
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Planes

178
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:38,143
The city needed infrastructure to support not just the full-time residents

179
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
But visitors to

180
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,775
Every summer thousands of disciples came for rajneesh's Annual Festival

181
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
In the off-season

182
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,127
People came to take meditation courses and experience life

183
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
In the city

184
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:53,247
They built a strip mall and a hotel buildings for religious ceremonies

185
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
A crematorium

186
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
A discoteca post office

187
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
Many of the buildings were designed in a rustic

188
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,439
Alpine Style with wooden siding

189
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
Housing on the other hand was built quickly

190
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,351
With lots of prefab a frame structures littered across the valley

191
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,447
It was amazing at what they were doing and they were doing it very very quickly

192
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,311
But the rent is rapid expansion did not go unchecked

193
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:23,711
Immediately after rajneeshpuram became an official city in Oregon Environmental Group challenged in court

194
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Operation

195
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Basa

196
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
The

197
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
Attempt

198
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
To build a big city out in the desert

199
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
Which was

200
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
Agriculture

201
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,255
As a huge problem

202
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
For the land use laws

203
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,167
A judge ruled that the sannyasins could keep building there

204
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
Despite the pending lawsuit

205
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
But he won them

206
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,823
If the environmentalists won their case against rajneeshpuram

207
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
Almost everything they built

208
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
Would have to come down

209
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:59,039
Sonia Austin's were undaunted they work 16-hour day 6 days a week building up their City

210
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,343
Here's ma Anand Espirito again

211
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
And so we would work

212
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,951
All day and usually that would go until midnight

213
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
And then go to bed

214
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,119
Maybe have a lover and make love all night and then get up again

215
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,679
The morning and start over

216
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:20,543
Rajneesh taught his followers that meditation was the highest form of worship

217
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
And that work

218
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
Would be there meditation

219
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
A doctrine of Relentless work is

220
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
Pretty convenient when you're trying to erect

221
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
A city from scratch

222
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,087
Of course all that construction cost a lot of money

223
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,927
Luckily rajneesh had a Global Network of lucrative communes

224
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
That sent the revenue to rajneeshpuram

225
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
Plus the guru's followers surrendered everything

226
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
Sing from their former lives

227
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,655
They sold their jewelry their cars their homes

228
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
And give it to the city

229
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
The ranch was changing fast

230
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,871
Listen to ride in 1981 but by 1983

231
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:02,015
They build 140 small dams up and down the John Day River to slow the rate of a rodent

232
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
And it work

233
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,855
The dusty Golden Valley was Green

234
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
We had an amazing organic

235
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Farm

236
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
I was

237
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,023
Very very nutritious vegetables

238
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,911
Within the first couple years the population jumped from a few hundred people to around 2,000

239
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,983
And their Farms produced almost everything they needed

240
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,567
They also accomplish some pretty impressive Feats of engineering

241
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:30,943
Rebuild a 45-acre reservoir held by a 400-foot Earthen Dam

242
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:37,087
Not to mention a mass transit system composed of 85 school buses that zigzag around Rodney Parham

243
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,415
But while the citizens got around in school buses

244
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
The guru

245
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
Preferred a Rolls-Royce

246
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
In fact

247
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
She owned 93 Rolls Royce

248
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:51,679
And everyday in a kind of ritual he drive around the city in one of them

249
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
Noon and then again like a

250
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
5

251
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,847
He would drive the roads and people the sannyasins would line up along the road

252
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
Hands clasped

253
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
In front of their faces

254
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,551
Sort of being blissed-out as he went by and tears streaming down their face

255
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,207
Writer of the time he moved to America the group began about silence

256
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:19,327
To be so cold drive-bys were one of the ways that rajneesh communicated with his followers

257
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:26,239
But it seems like he also just really like the feel of the open road and then he would hit the highway and he wouldn't

258
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,823
Drive a hundred miles an hour I don't know how many tickets he got

259
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
How many

260
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
Times he was

261
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Threatened

262
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
Have his license taken away but

263
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
Evidently was a lot

264
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,319
While rajneesh was in silence he set up a government for the ranch

265
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,391
An elite Inner Circle of female senior

266
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,535
He wanted to come in to be a matriarchate because he believed that women were less dominated by their egos

267
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,119
At the center of the circle was a woman named ma Anand Sheela

268
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,447
Sheila was rajneesh's secretary and chief spokes

269
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,055
She was one of the only people he spoke to during his long silence

270
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,127
Here's archival tape of ma Anand Sheela

271
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,431
My purpose is

272
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,015
To live better living Master book launch. Mesh

273
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
Harmoniously

274
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
Because people around here

275
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,671
And he's a very beautiful rich life which we have here

276
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,255
Whenever Milt Ritter came to report on the ranch

277
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,583
She would try to convince him to join the sannyasins

278
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
What's the lose your everything is taken care of for you here all your food is made for your laundry is done you have

279
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,383
Housing why wouldn't you just do this

280
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,967
Whenever Milt Ritter came to report on the ranch

281
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,783
She would try to convince him to join the sannyasins

282
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
What's the lose everything is taken care of for you here all your food is made for your laundry is done you have

283
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Housing

284
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
Why wouldn't you just do this

285
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:01,215
Sheila didn't convince mehltretter to move but she had a very persuasive way about her

286
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
And she was becoming more and more powerful

287
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
There was a kind of

288
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,895
We could call a power-elite so

289
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,199
Sheila was considered to be

290
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,295
The boss and especially when one was in silence

291
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,623
Then she took on more and more sporty

292
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:25,535
At first it seemed like she wanted to have a good relationship with this Roundy Oregon Community party out at the ranch

293
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:32,959
But it didn't last a lot of people think that it was Sheila that steered rajneeshpuram into a dark chapter

294
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,543
One that began with the neighboring town of anti

295
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,175
Antelope with a small community of about 40 people

296
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
Mostly retirees

297
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Phenibut depressed

298
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Little

299
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Community

300
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,111
And had a grocery store and

301
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
Maybe a gas station

302
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
I think

303
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,511
And not a whole lot more

304
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,327
It's on yachts and saw an opportunity in Antelope

305
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,167
They knew the future of their coming with subject to the County's laws

306
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
If they had control of a

307
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,311
Town and establish town is incorporation wasn't hanging in the balance

308
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:14,431
They can influence County policy and carve out a permanent place for themselves in Oregon

309
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,759
Soda sannyasins purchase vacant houses in town

310
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,855
Move their people in and generally made life in Antelope miserable

311
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
They harass locals const

312
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,975
Partied in their driveways made fun of them on the street

313
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,535
And just to intimidate people

314
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
They took photos of license

315
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,631
It's and videotape City Council meetings

316
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,447
They were obviously given a mission

317
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
Take over the town of

318
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
Antelope

319
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:46,175
Over the course of a couple years the sannyasins Stacked the city council and elected their own mayor

320
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479
They even took over Antelope School

321
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,575
Enforce ranchers to bust their children to another town an hour away

322
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
They ran the place

323
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,511
And eventually they changed the name of antelope to rajneesh

324
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
Now they were pissing people off

325
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,143
Anti rajneesh sentiments spread like wildfire

326
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Across the state

327
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,519
You started seeing bumper stickers that said better dead than red

328
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,079
In reference to the sannyasins Red Clothing

329
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:20,479
And some of this anti rajneesh sentiment turned violent a hotel in Portland owned by the rajneeshees was bombed

330
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Don't know when was killed

331
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,575
And both the guru and she will begin receiving death threats

332
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,135
Sheila felt they were under attack

333
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
Stop

334
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Persecute

335
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
Once and for all

336
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
And if they want to come too

337
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
Can you persecuting us

338
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,607
Even though we are nonviolent

339
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
People

340
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
Rebuild Showdown

341
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,031
Kind of harassment

342
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,895
Rusty Spoons police force they called it peace Force

343
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:53,759
Started buying more and more weapons everywhere

344
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,807
Sheila carrying a sidearm

345
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,647
The city even had two helicopter reconnaissance teams

346
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,559
And then there were demonstrations that they would show to the media

347
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
If they're firing range

348
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Tamales

349
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
Automatic and semi-automatic weapons

350
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
They had a lot of fun

351
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:18,079
The Takeover of antelope the brandishing of weapons it was all too much

352
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:23,455
State and County politicians got together and put the bureaucratic SmackDown on rajneeshpuram

353
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:28,319
First the Oregon land conservation and development commission amended their rules

354
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
Now counties would have to check with the state

355
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,439
Before allowing a new city to incorporate

356
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,743
The new rule was retroactive

357
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,327
2 right around the time rajneeshpuram was incorporated

358
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,167
And then a County Judge stalled all Construction in rajneesh

359
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,263
No more building until their status as a city with sorted out

360
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,103
Rajneeshpuram seem to be losing the battle to exist as a city

361
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,407
Pierce County planner dandaro again

362
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,527
And it wasn't long after that too I think that they'd then began to move in

363
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,087
The street people from around the country

364
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,695
And bussing the man and

365
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:10,047
Housing them there on the ranch 84

366
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,887
She went to the homeless

367
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,703
Their idea was that

368
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,519
If we can bring in enough people

369
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
A live here

370
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,359
And we can convince them to vote

371
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,175
Are the rajneesh candidates we could

372
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,991
Actually get a couple of people on that on the County Council

373
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,039
And maybe get some things

374
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,831
Going our way

375
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,927
She was denied that the new residents were there just to vote

376
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,231
She claimed she wanted to share the Bounty with

377
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,303
And name the initiative the share home Pro

378
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,143
Nobody else is taking care of them somebody has to do it

379
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
And I'm grateful that they are ready

380
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Disheveled

381
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,775
The program got a lot

382
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
Of media at 10

383
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,871
Mention some 300 the new arrivals now meditate

384
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,175
70 of just become full-fledged sannyasins

385
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:04,831
As many as 4,000 homeless Americans were brought to rajneeshpuram during the share home

386
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,695
But behind the scenes the new residents weren't

387
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Treated well

388
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:16,863
Rajneeshpuram leadership tried to keep them in line by drugging them with Haldol the powerful antipsychotic

389
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,447
Not surprisingly, many of the new residents ended up leaving

390
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:26,847
And then in a final desperate move the leadership of rajneeshpuram devised an insane plan

391
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,663
To prevent the rest of the county from voting

392
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,711
By making people to 6

393
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
To go to the polls

394
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,063
The way they did it evidently is

395
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,391
They would go to these restaurants

396
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
And

397
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
Buy a lunch

398
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,767
And when they went to the salad bar they would like

399
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,303
Pull out a little

400
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,095
Squirt bottle

401
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
That they had

402
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,983
Concocted in the lab at rajneeshpuram that had salmonella in it

403
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
And they would just

404
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
Spray this over the salad bar

405
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,895
And then slip it back in their pocket and nobody knew

406
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:05,503
There were no fatalities but 750 people are poison

407
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,111
The sannyasins power elite wouldn't be connected to the poisonings for another year

408
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,951
To this day it is the largest Act of bioterrorism

409
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
Honeywell Sol

410
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,375
My 1985 rajneeshpuram had entered its death row

411
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
It has become a kind of

412
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Oppressive

413
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
Energy

414
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
You could say

415
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
The ranch

416
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,567
The guru finally emerged from his vow of silence

417
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
Sheila couldn't speak on his behalf anymore

418
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,479
And then I think she started getting more and more nervous as he

419
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
Out more

420
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
Then she started

421
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Seething frog

422
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
Power was was winning

423
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
And suddenly

424
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
Sheila

425
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
What's going on

426
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,047
She left rajneeshpuram for West Germany

427
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
And then once she hits

428
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
Fled then all these things started

429
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
Light because then people started speaking

430
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
And

431
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,055
And putting the pieces of puzzle together

432
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:07,455
There was a long list of Dirty Deeds that Sheila and her the tenants had perpetrated over the past several years

433
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:14,111
Including but not limited to the Salmonella poisoning operation throughout Rogers from

434
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,464
A plot to murder The guru's Physician and Oregon's Attorney General

435
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,048
And the firebombing of Wasco County Planning Department

436
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
Dan DeRose office

437
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:29,216
There are also rumors of crimes Sheila and her Inner Circle perpetrated against sannyasins

438
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,032
Sedating people for days against their will

439
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,176
Telling troublemakers they are hiv-positive and quarantining them so their descent wouldn't catch

440
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,504
Some sannyasins were forcibly sterilized

441
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,600
Ninety-nine and forty-four 100% of the people

442
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,648
Who lived at rajneeshpuram

443
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,464
They were just good people trying to eke out a lie

444
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,304
You know in what they thought was the perfect Utopia

445
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
Antebellum

446
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
This was shocking

447
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
The complete shop

448
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
Disbelief

449
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,360
And then at the same time once it started coming tonight there was relief

450
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
Then she was gone

451
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,944
The girls started talking to reporters

452
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,480
He claimed innocence

453
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,296
And invited the authorities to investigate the ranch

454
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,880
Did you really not know what was going on in Antelope

455
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,072
But I was silent I was completely unaware

456
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
That's an archival recording of bhagwan shree rajneesh

457
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:35,520
Soon Sheila was extradited from West Germany on a slew of charges

458
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,848
She pled guilty but said rajneesh was The Mastermind

459
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,408
That she was only acting on behalf of

460
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
For Spiritual master

461
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Her sentence

462
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
Three concurrent

463
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,528
20 year terms

464
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,088
To be served in Pleasanton California

465
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,880
The guru was also charged

466
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Specs for Less

467
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:56,512
He got 5 years probation $400,000 in fines

468
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
And

469
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
He was deported

470
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,352
It was the whole Ranch

471
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
Just got a ground to a

472
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
A standstill

473
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
These people were

474
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
Grieving

475
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
And then

476
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,824
Rodney Strong

477
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
Everything was

478
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
Being auctioned off

479
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
Everything from

480
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,416
Rolls-royce's

481
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,952
Two police uniform

482
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,256
After the auction

483
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
It was a ghost

484
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,888
Sarita was one of the last sannyasins to leave

485
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:39,520
She admits things went terribly awry but she still feels good about what they built in Russian

486
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
Even though it didn't last

487
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
The fact is

488
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,408
Stood for a number of years

489
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
We were living in a

490
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
Very very beautiful

491
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,040
Harmony with each other

492
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,576
So

493
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
This was an amazing

494
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
Achievement

495
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
And I think

496
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,952
Can serve as a model

497
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,000
The fact that there was some

498
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,584
I'm kind of power games going on and there was these destructive elements

499
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,888
That you will find anywhere

500
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,008
Rajneesh return to India where you continue to be a spiritual leader under a different name

501
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
OSHA

502
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,592
He died of heart failure in 1990

503
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,408
What is teaching still command a global following

504
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,248
Sheela only served about two years of her 20-year sentence

505
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,808
She was released early for good behavior

506
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
Now she lives in Switzerland

507
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,928
Where she owns nursing homes for the elderly

508
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,952
And disabled

509
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,032
Today the city that the samuelson's Left Behind has been transformed into a different kind

510
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
Community

511
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,896
My co-producer Steven and I went out to where rajneeshpuram used to be

512
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:53,504
We drove down the long Gravel Road and descended down into the valley that

513
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
Is now home

514
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,088
It's one of the largest youth Christian camps in the

515
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
Country

516
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,928
Owned and operated by an organization called Young Life

517
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:07,072
The meditation Hall where sannyasins used to gather is now a massive Sports

518
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
Flex with a batting cage

519
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,424
For basketball courts ping pong tables you name it

520
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,984
The old hotel is now a dormitory

521
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,592
Occasionally they use the airstrip the sannyasins Left Behind The Flying International

522
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,224
Rajneeshpuram isn't acid anymore

523
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,576
It's now called the Washington family ranch and is under County jurisdiction

524
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:33,440
It's still a place for religious Seekers but not the kind that want to build a Utopia

525
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,024
Does thousands of Christian teens looking to have

526
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,072
The best week

527
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096

Music from Amnesia his first album just came out it is going to be big

532
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,984
I like the album so much I decided to put the full vocal version of the first song on the album at the end of this episode so

533
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Stay tuned

534

Sperm in beautiful Downtown Oakland California

537
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:43,328
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered World a man-made site

538
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:50,496
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis talking to me in my

Wife is in another room in a kid is another remember all hearing that voice

540
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,896
Technology talk to us

541
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,200
It is a creation of Sonic trash

542
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:05,856
