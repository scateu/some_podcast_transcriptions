36
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,928
Over the summer a new movement started to gain momentum

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,000
The movement to ban plastic drinking straws

38
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,328
It's now legal for Food Service businesses in Seattle

39
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
To provide a plastic

00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
Harming wildlife

46
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,112
The argument against

47
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
We consume

48
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
Tons of plastic

49
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,208
Not much of it gets recycled

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,280
Most of it ends up in landfills in oceans

51
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,096
Reduce a little of that way

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,168
But like most issues these days

53
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
There's been a lot of disagreement about

54
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,264
There's been backlash from few directions

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
Gluten conservatives

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
The lapse war against wait for it

57
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,664
Straws

Creamy rice

59
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,760
Is this idea that we are holier than thou

60
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,344
But people with disabilities also spoke up because some of those folks

61
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,160
Actually need straws in order to drink

62
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
That it might take away

63
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
Their tool of Independence

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,584
And there's even disagreement about the actual number of straws that we throw away

65
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
You hear the number 500 million

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
Floating around

67
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,496
Apparently that number came not from a rigorous study

68
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,568
But from a precocious 9 year old science project

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
9 year old

70
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
9 year old

71
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:03,808
Even the environmentalists could not agree on whether the straw ban was a good thing or not

72
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:10,208
Everybody got to have their thing the real problem is cars the real problem is building the real problem is have you seen China's admission

73
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,536
You know the real problem is too much nitrogen and

74
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
You know ocean is it if

75
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,888
Application in energy and environmental problem

76
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
Is probably more important than flask

77
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,240
This is journalist Alexis Madrigal

78
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
He wrote a great essay about pasta

79
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,360
6 drawers for the Atlantic and he's going to be our guide through all of this

80
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
Because he says

81
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,456
That when you zoom out from the controversies of today

82
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
And look at the iPhone

83
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
History of plastic

84
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
They can tell us a lot

85
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
About America

86
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,952
Tell me about some of those bigger things that emerged when you looked at the history of plastic

87
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:47,328
You know I used to do this quite a bit like just take some little object and just

88
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
Trace its history you know you can look up

89
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
The patents on Google and you can

90
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,264
Search around for another company is that made it and you can see it

91
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,384
Technical Evolution you know you can just look at it like the way you would look at the development of any

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Technology

93
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
But the thing I was soaked

94
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,480
Crazy about the straw

95
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Who's the richest

96
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
It's so many of these like real

97
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,112
Crew major trends

98
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
In the way that the

99
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
The country worked

100
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:19,327
The straw is there for the invention of American industrialism for Organization for Public Health

101
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,143
Perform for like the suburbanization of the country

102
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
Fast food

103
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,007
And now of course the culture works like it's there for all of them

104
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
And to tell me where it all began

105
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,407
Did someone invented the straw or was it just always there

106
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
So you know there's even like

107
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
Scientific studies

108
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
The show that orangutan

109
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,671
Looks like we'll collect the straw-like thing is cool for doing straw like stuffy nose

110
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Burlington version

111
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,767
But in nineteenth-century America

112
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
They see the straw with Rye

113
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
Literally no grass.

114
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,143
This hollow tube

115
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
And you know you dry it

116
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,239
Cut it into shape and that's what what happens that was the straw

117
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Travis Tritt

118
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,103
Around this time they're also straws made out of more durable

119
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
Like metal

120
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
Glass

121
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
But then

122
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,503
Along Comes this guy

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,575
1888 Marvin Stone

124
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,391
He creates what was then called the artificial straw

125
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,999
Any artificial straw is basically paper dipped in some kind of wax

126
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
C substance

127
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Paraffin

128
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,351
And that becomes this new standard

129
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,679
It wasn't just that it was artificial is also that it was

130
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Disposable

131
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,007
This was basically this

132
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
Incredibly cheap

133
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
And it's incredibly busy

134
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
Disposable and hygienic

135
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,919
This wasn't something that came from nature

136
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
He was in fact

137
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Produced

138
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,551
To a standard you know this wasn't patent straw

139
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,671
And the fact that this straw was hygienic and produced to a standard was important

140
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:54,559
His drawers are becoming a tool in the emerging Public Health movement that was happening in cities around this time

141
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
You know the reason public health is emerging at this time it's because people in American cities are just like dying all the time

142
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
Name of communicable diseases

143
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,823
A lot of illnesses were spread through dirty drinking water

144
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,127
Understand why this was such a big healthy

145
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,943
Guess you and white straws would eventually help to solve it

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
You have to understand how

147
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,015
Public water fountains worked at

148
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
In a lot of

149
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,391
Places in the city but work places in in in public locations

150
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
The water fountain wasn't

151
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,535
Like what we think I'm not like this little thing with water bubbling out of it or like

152
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
Depressed little button water comes out

153
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,911
It was just kind of like water that was sitting there or if a little

154
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,239
Tap and you would actually fill a cup that was attached to it

155
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
And it's drink out of it and it be like

156
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Chain or whatever

157
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
Soyo

158
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,407
A bunch of different people would all drink from the same cup

159
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,943
We actually did an episode about the

160
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,503
Early water fountains you something called

161
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
The common cup

162
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,623
And it became one of the main targets of the public health campaigners

163
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
There was acting like one

164
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
Kansas doctor

165
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
Who started to like push

166
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279
This campaign against the common cup

167
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,839
At the tone of this campaign

168
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
It's intense

169
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,167
Maybe they literally would show

170
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,775
The Grim Reaper taking a drink from the common cup with like a little girl

171
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
Next to him

172
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:15,199
Drinking from the same cup you know

173
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
Do you want Public Health reform or some kind of Reform you just need to go for the throat

174
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
Is it going to kill your children

175
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:32,863
Acquiring straw dispensers in certain public spaces in the case of the common cup

176
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,727
Strasbourg way to avoid actually putting your mouth or somebody else's mouth in bed

177
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
But it wasn't just

178
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,335
Public Health reformers that contributed to the rise of

179
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,199
There's there's two things there's a public-health Mania on the one side

180
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,783
And on the other side there's the development of

181
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,855
Certain bubbly carbonated beverage

182
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,159
Club soda and

183
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,951
The soda fountain

184
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:04,351
Occupies this really important place in kind of late 19th century early 20th century

185
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
For 1

186
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:11,263
I'm most of the public places where you could go have a drink or saloons and saloons were primarily gendered male

187
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
Urban women

188
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
With increasing freedoms in the city

189
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
Wanted to place to go

190
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,479
And many urban women were also involved in various temperance

191
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Movement

192
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
And again

193
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,623
Saloons they're serving booze there and soda fountains become this kind of

194
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Clean

195
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
Healthy alternative

196
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
So they're all these various

197
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,023
Transurban ization Thrice the soda fountain

198
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
The temperance movement the rise of Public Health

199
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
They all helped lead to the

200
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
This booming

201
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
Strong industry

202
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,495
Yeah and it's amazing see if you look at their

203
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,799
The Battle Creek Enquirer Enos Mall

204
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,127
Paper in May of 1924 they actually

205
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
List out how would how far did this go

206
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
How big was this boo

207
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,551
And they say do to the Yankee Mania for sanitation

208
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:01,695
The output of artificial straws has increased from 165 million in 1901

209
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
24 billion

210
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
A year

211
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,167
A manufacturer pointed out yesterday that laid end-to-end the straws would build an ant

212
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Subway

213
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
16 times around the world

214
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
At the equator

215
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
Into 4 billion straws

216
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
In context

217
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,407
Talking about America is 114 million people

218
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
At 4:35

219
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Strasburg

220
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,087
A lot of stress I mean I do I can't I sleep

221
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,927
I'm probably like a hundred year kind of guy

222
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
By the 1950s and 60

223
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
The strong will become less and actual driver of important

224
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Football change

225
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
And more

226
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,471
Kind of insignificant object surfing along much bigger trends

227
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
Friends like

228
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
The rise of fast food culture

229
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,295
For businessman named Ray Kroc

230
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,879
Took over a little restaurant in Southern California called McDonald's

231
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
He was a paper cup sales

232
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,743
Which meant that he was also a straw salesman

233
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,559
So he works for the Lily toilet paper company

234
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
For a long time

235
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
15 years

236
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
Going around the Midwest

237
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Selling

238
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
Straws and cups

239
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
The soda fountain

240
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
Amazing

241
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
Here you know what he he wrote

242
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
A memoir which

243
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,919
We keep radeberger shop and he called his Memoir grinding it out

244
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,551
Addiction tell you a little bit about him. He like moonlighted as a

245
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
The Pianist

246
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
But he was a Salesman like

247
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Kind of one of those like

248
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
Really doesn't feel like a

249
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,999
21st century story like it feels like a like a

250
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Weird story

251
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
But Ray Kroc

252
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
In this Memoir grinding it out

253
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,887
He describes papercut

254
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,447
What kind of disposable you don't hygienic

255
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
World

256
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
He was like

257
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
They were Innovative and upbeat

258
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
I sent from the out

259
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,943
Paper cups were part of the way America was headed

260
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:05,599
She was right like that was part of the way of America was going like every we were going to throw away everything we throw

261
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
Phones

262
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,719
Throw away computers we throw away couches

263
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
So Croc

264
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,095
Becomes a central figure lease in my story because he should have Kinect

265
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
This paper cup industry

266
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,983
To this greater concept is like disposability

267
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
In America

268
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,335
Selling all those cops brought Ray Kroc in

269
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Contact with soda fountain

270
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,943
And he eventually went into business selling milkshake mixer

271
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
This led him to Southern California

272
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
We saw the first McDonald's in operation

273
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,623
He bought his way into the small company

274
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
Announce did the original owners

275
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
This is crazy

276
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
McDonald's goes

277
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
From base like a hundred

278
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,631
Knight Rises to a thousand and then just like keeps on going pure like kind of

279
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Dick growth

280
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,983
The American public are basically

281
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Beast

282
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
Eating

283
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
People

284
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
And it works

285
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,895
Day after day after day after day

286
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
People just want more of it

287
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
I can't give them everything they like

288
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
But this one thing I sure can get

289
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
And you have with

290
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,927
Place with the rise of fast food and suburbia

291
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
In the amount of

292
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,047
I have wrapping basically for food

293
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
You're getting your food in a box

294
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
And that's just

295
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
Hadn't been the way that things were

296
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
Patricia Lee Dunn

297
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,799
Select the Plastic industry at the same time is growing up because of this disposable

298
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
Can you talk about this transition

299
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,407
From paper straws to

300
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Yes

301
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
When is inter

302
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
Everything about Plastics

303
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:41,087
1950 the world is only producing like one and a half million times

304
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,927
Classic which of course is a lot but it's not

305
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:50,815
He's nowhere close to somewhere where we get I mean by the late sixties that production has grown

306
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Tenfold

307
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
Don't really kind of in the fifties into the sea

308
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
60s were decent people are going

309
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
Is there an object

310
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
Maybe it should be plastic

311
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,175
Chairs become plastic and plates become plastic and just everything kind of if you can do it you can do it in plastic

312
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,479
Pental quartz straws become part of the

313
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,575
1970's and 80's plastic straws had become ubiquitous

314
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
They were every

315
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,927
And while straw design continue to evolve slightly

316
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,255
The more dramatic changes were happening in the straw industry

317
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
At this point

318
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Both in our economy

319
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
And also in this artifact

320
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
Straws history

321
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
It's really the mechanism

322
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
That organized

323
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
The factories

324
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
That become the most interesting

325
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Object

326
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
And those mechanisms are basically Financial capitalism beginning to really move away from

327
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Being about

328
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
Family businesses

329
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
Organizing production

330
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,159
You know at these kind of local levels or Regional levels

331
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
And it really becomes

332
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Every

333
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Thing

334
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:56,095
Is just a money waiting to be made through financialization

335
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:02,751
By financialization Alexis is talking about a big Trend in economics that's been happening over the last few decades

336
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,311
Our manufacturing sector has been shrinking

337
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,639
While our financial sector has been expanding

338
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,479
Which has big implications for who ends up making money

339
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,807
Long straws and a million other consumer goods

340
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:21,183
The slice of money that's going to the people who provide the money as opposed to provide the products

341
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,839
Is growing and that has really important consequences for how things get made and who makes them and

342
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:33,727
Where are the factories are located and how many people are employed in the culture of work and

343
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
And all these things

344
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,055
To tell me what happened to Maryland

345
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
This is one of the country's biggest troll makers

346
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
What would happen to them around this time

347
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Maryland cup

348
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
It just sucks

349
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
Classic American story

350
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Right

351
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,575
Owned by these brothers the Shapiro Brothers

352
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
They started out as like

353
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
Bakery and Anna turn into this

354
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,975
A bakery services provider and then they start making

355
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
So

356
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
After they make straws they make

357
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
Cups after they make

358
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
Cubs tickets

359
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
Partners from

360
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,471
And it remained basically family-owned

361
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
But eventually

362
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,359
Show the original management is gone the people are aging

363
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,175
And they decide that they're going to sell the company

364
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
They sell the company to another company

365
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
Call Fort Howard

366
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,063
Hard-charging

367
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,599
CEOs and their

368
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,415
Yeah there's a great story in the Baltimore Sun

369
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,023
Where they describe going to the sales meeting you know the Maryland cup Executives like I'll show up

370
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
The new bosses are there

371
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,375
And he literally probably had a flip chart

372
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:38,751
WhitePages flipchart it said hear your old values and they were service quality responding to

373
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Customers

374
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
Are there parallel you literally like

375
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,359
Flip the flip chart to the next page and it said

376
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
New value

377
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
Profits profits profits

378
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,087
Damn that's quite a PowerPoint do you know

379
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
Maryland cop had been a very profitable company with a highly family

380
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,935
Oriented kind of culture you know the boss has a dress up as Santa Claus you know turkeys to all

381
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
Everybody at Thanksgiving and you know that kind of like

382
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
Paternalistic

383
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:17,663
We are all one big family company thing once they go into Fort Howard it becomes

384
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,247
I truly just kind of like work we're going to have to make money so

385
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,807
All these people get laid off they cut pensions

386
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:30,207
Did you all this stuff that's basically like the plot of Tommy Boy kind of speaker with his movie with Chris Farley

387
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,023
Ohio

388
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,119
Sowinski Industries has an offer on the table to buy us out

389
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,703
But if you realise Callahan has been family owned

390
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,775
Since Tommy's great-grandfather laid the first brick

391
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,847
And I'll be damned if that's going to change on my watch

392
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,223
But it's played out many many many many

393
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
And

394
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,623
In the end what ends up happening is that Fort Howard itself then

395
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,671
Is bought by private-equity firm

396
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:07,327
Who then goes and combines a bunch of different paper cup and disposable Goods companies

397
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
Into one kind of

398
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
Larger entity

399
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
And then spins it out

400
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
Loaded with a bunch of

401
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:18,335
And this is kind of a classic move that happens in private equity

402
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
Because you can borrow against these companies

403
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:25,247
Pay your investors and then spin out this other company that that is like soda floating in the ocean like

404
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
With rocks tied around its feet right

405
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:33,951
So operationally like from the from making cups and straws and all this stuff they're still making money but because

406
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
To pay all this debt

407
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,767
They're like deeply in the red

408
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
I have to lay off people

409
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
Have to close factories

410
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
And it is just

411
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
Classic story

412
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
I've kind of like vulture capitalism

413
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
And

414
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
The fact that

415
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,591
Straw like this

416
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,663
Stupid straw dislike empty vessel

417
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,015
Somehow also is tied up in the financial of America

418
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:03,135
Just said something to me every single goddamn thing is tied up with this

419
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Kind of system of production

420
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:14,143
Can Banning straws really make a dent in our ecological problems

421
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
No it's not it's up to the scale of the of the problem

422
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,455
Line I see what all this stuff cuz obviously

423
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
It's hard to connect

424
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,295
Gala 1888 patent to the

425
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
Artificial straw

426
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,927
To financial capitalism in its current form

427
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
Here's the through line as I see it

428
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,791
The country has shed manufacturing job for decades

429
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,607
Straws contribute tiny share

430
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
Two environmental disasters that

431
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
Far beyond it

432
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:54,079
Mini economy continues to work on this way the concentrates wealth for the richest people

433
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,151
Yeah the sodas that are even like passing through

434
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:03,551
The Shroud and the people's stomachs are contributing to this obesity epidemic that threatened sexy roll back the public health reform

435
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,415
That actually got people's life expectancies to grow and previous eras

436
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,207
And there's this

437
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
System

438
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,559
Now that's attached to the straw

439
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,887
That helped to create you know disposable products

440
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,935
And then disposable companies

441
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:26,591
Disposable people both the workers who work within the system but also people who just have to live with all of these cries

442
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,383
Places that have been created

443
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,687
Structures far beyond

444
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
Their control

445
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
Is it was almost like

446
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
So we can all see that

447
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
Going on around us

448
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,159
Only when you focus down on like the most

449
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
Anything

450
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
That you can

451
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
See that massive structure

452
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
Temperature away

453
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,295
Arguably the most significant technological achievement of the 20th century

454
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,367
At least according to one of the descendants of the inventor

455
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,159
History of the Bendy straw

456
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
After this

457
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
Between the beats

458
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
Bongs and chatter of our devices

459
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,055
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

460
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:34,687
If I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

461
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:40,063
Talking to me and my wife is in another room and another hearing.

462
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
Voice technology tok

463
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
To us

464
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,415
It is a creation of Sonic trap

465
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,487
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

466
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,071
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

467
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,119
To make them more human

468
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
Turn the living room lights on

469
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Okay

470
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
Dim the living room lights to 50

471
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
80%

472
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Okay

473
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:09,759
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

474
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,807
Makes for a much more natural

475
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Experience

476
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
Turn the living room lights on

477
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
Dim the living room lights to 50

478
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,488
2%

479
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,144
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

480
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,680
About how are sounds gay

481
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
Is impacting our health

482
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

483
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

484
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
Right here

485
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
NPR

486
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
We need to talk about

487
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,552
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

488
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:48,160
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine

489
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
Thinking about it all the time

490
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:55,584
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

491
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,864
And you don't know why

492
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
Then it may be time to seek help

493
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,240
Go to oh my God. Info podcast

Oh my God. Info podcast

496
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,896
Oh my God. Info

497
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
As Alexis mentioned earlier

498
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,552
The Maryland cup Corporation got bought out and then

499
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
It's buyer's guide

500
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
Bought out in Solano

501
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,904
The capital is fast food chain

502
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,976
But before Maryland cups sold their family business

503
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,024
They grew in part by acquiring a

504
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
A revolutionary

505
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
Key patents

506
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
From another

507
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,656
Kirk Olson is here to talk about

508
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
That other family-owned business

509
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
They bought out

510
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
Flexible straw

511
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
The first of the contacts

512
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,640
As Alexis pointed out we'll never really know when humans first started using straws

513
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,480
But there's this Sumerian to about 5000 years

514
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,784
And I would still there these figures who

515
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,576
Appear to be drinking from straw

516
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,672
Sure enough when they found this ornate drinking

517
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
Precious stones

518
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,072
Really fancy and it's really old

519
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,864
It's probably not the oldest draw that

520
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
Ever exist

521
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
Digital this one we found

522
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,472
You may not even be close

523
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,312
It's expensive materials aside it's still just a straight to

524
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:14,688
Precious sure but otherwise not that different from a modern grass

525
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Azure paper

526
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Elasticsearch

527
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,272
So in a lot of ways

528
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,576
Straw design hasn't fundamentally changed for

529
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
Thousands of years

530
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
Or at least it didn't

531
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
Until the 19th

532
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
And that's when the f***

533
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes

534
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
And as The Story Goes

535
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,632
The inventor Joseph E Friedman took his daughter to get a milkshake

536
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Steak in San Francisco

537
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
At a sweet shop unbiased

538
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,776
But as he's watching his daughter struggle with this normal straight straw

539
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
He thinks to himself

540
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,896
Hey you get off maybe there's a better way to do this and it's like the classic

541
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
You see a problem you fix

542
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
It's a problem that this guy wasn't a

543
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,248
Strong maker by trade how did he die

544
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,528
Create this New Hampshire

545
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
Start out with this

546
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,112
Simple existing paper straw

547
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,416
How many slots in a metal screw into the neck

548
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,000
How many wraps dental floss around the screw

549
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
So that

550
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
When I tightened it down it creates ridges

551
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,376
And these ridges allow the things

552
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
You know like an accordion

553
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,472
Till you just use the screws threading

554
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:15,872
To provide the groove and then

555
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,712
And he's really clear about this tune the patent application is like

556
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,808
I didn't invent the accordion I didn't invent the straw

557
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,648
All I did was I combine this idea flexibility with this you know Street

558
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
Tube for drinking out of

559
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,976
So he MacGyver's this thing into existence

560
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Does it

561
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,048
Revolutionize the industry by the way what does it do

562
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,328
It actually took

563
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
A while for these Flex

564
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,680
Which is kind of shocking

565
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:46,080
Because his brother oldest soda shop and yet somehow

566
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:52,480
It takes him 10 years to start selling these things

567
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,296
Taking other jobs on the side he needed to work as a real estate agent

568
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:59,136
Circuito live and he also got cash infusions from his brothers invest

569
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Business

570
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,720
Got some business help from my sister Betty Who

571
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,352
Finally 10 years later they get their first buyers

572
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
And it has nothing to do with kids

573
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
So who are the first people to buy

574
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,008
Winter beanies large hospitals

575
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
Which if you think about it makes perfect sense

576
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Steak-Out

577
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
Injured patients disabled patients

578
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,688
People lying in bed to a trouble sitting out

579
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:28,320
And so these Flex straws which argued openable disposable sanitary

580
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,368
They're just perfect for this Hospital

581
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,208
And from there of course they go on restaurants

582
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,512
Kids juice boxes and all that but they start out

583
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Hospital

584
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
It's a really

585
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,608
Interesting example of Universal Design

586
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,912
It's really taken by a community that needs it

587
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,728
And then everyone realizes hey these are kind of nice for us

588
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
2

589
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,056
You know as we mentioned before there's some movement

590
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Ball plastic

591
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
Straws banned

592
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
Do they still have a

593
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
Place in society

594
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
Minutes really debatable it is

595
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,760
Still being debated

596
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:03,392
And some people are saying hey luck let's go back to these paper bendy straws that worked right that's what Freedom was

597
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,184
Inventing with in the first place

598
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,512
About disability rights activists are saying

599
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,864
Hey you know that's great for some people but they can also fall apart and not that durable

600
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,192
There's also an argument that okay well then we should use reusable one

601
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,984
Eco-friendly life

602
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,800
Glass or metal but those are hard to keep clean

603
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,824
They can break

604
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
So there issues with all these different type

605
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
Pipes in for a certain demographic

606
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
Who really needs them

607
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,992
There's a strong argument

608
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,016
Freaky thing around play

609
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
Plastic Bendy straw

610
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,344

654
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,800
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

664
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,864
Was found dead in my private gym

665
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,192
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

666
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,544
