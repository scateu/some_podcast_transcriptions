I'm Roman Mars

27
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,000
Here's someone you should know Julie Shapiro and executive producer of radiotopia and we're going to talk about showcase

28
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:41,888
Showcase is a new project from radiotopia in the first series in showcase

29
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
Happens to make a good 99% of the

30
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,520
So I asked Julie to come talk to

31
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
And this is very much

32
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,688
Your product that yours. So can you tell us a little bit about Showcase in the announcer for the mission of radiotopia

33
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,088
Sure World Showcase directly came out of our experience with podcast which we ran about a year ago where we invited

34
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,976
Anyone and everyone to submit podcast ideas about whatever they were interested in that wanted to make a podcast about

35
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:11,584
And we got over 1,500 entries muchos wants got your hustle it's now

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
A show in radiotopia

37
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
What's the thing that I'm popular show in a very very proud of anime

38
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,592
He's at the response has been getting a Dutch rabbit

39
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,408
I'm the point was we had so many great ideas

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
But they weren't all necessarily

41
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,320
Sustainable long-term show ideas and that will what if radiotopia could get

42
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
Behind

43
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
A podcast that featured

44
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,184
All of these different ideas one after another

45
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:42,048
I without them being separate podcast that had to go out and gain their own audience and live on their own

46
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,328
How could we

47
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
Use the radiotopia name and reputation to help support even more producers with different kinds of ideas that wouldn't

48
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Beyond going shows

49
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:57,408
And so what showcase is one podcast that has limited run series one after another with you

50
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,944
Are short breaks in between

51
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
And these will be shows up

52
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:04,320
All strikes were really going to play with Forum play with topic

53
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
Gina push boundaries

54
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,416
Giving you producers a chance and really

55
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:13,280
See how we can provide like really high quality listening for our audiences

56
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
How do you conceive of something

57
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
That

58
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,912
Sort of sticks together holds together enough

59
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
To be a

60
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,728
Radiotopia showing to represent

61
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
Are values in a certain

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
But also be desperate enough

63
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
2

64
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128
You'll make this an experiment worth having

65
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
I'm just looking for ideas that I know like I'm interested in automatically I haven't heard anything like that before

66
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,904
But the producer kind of fit the radiotopia profile their independence are highly ambitious

67
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
They have

68
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,768
Big ideas about the subject that they're bringing to my attention

69
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
But they have sent

70
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,840
Humor and they can play a little bit

71
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:53,472
And there's sound inclined I think every pitch I'm considering right now has a lot of sound involved because

72
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,288
That's really a Hallmark of a lot of radiotopia shows as a

73
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Careful crafting

74
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,896
Again how to experiment with the farm how to hear from new voices so

75
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
Part of it is like what are topic

76
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
Text we haven't heard yet you know go in those directions

77
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,088
And also just stopped encourage people to like really

78
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Come up with something

79
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,416
Brand new original something we can

80
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
Take a bit of a risk on because

81
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
Hoverboard is going to be in

82
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,839
Trying something new and giving listeners like a new listening experience

83
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
Typo

84
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
Podcast for

85
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
Be adventurous listener and I'll reward that

86
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
Type of person

87
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,687
It seems like just I'm going to just do this like input my 9 IP I had on a zit from a design perspective

88
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,991
Why all one podcast

89
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:42,367
Through this format what are you what type of experience are you trying to shape answer cultivate

90
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
With the audio

91
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
That's a really good question cuz we also talked about all of these series just being separate podcast there's some liability

92
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,607
Here what will people stick with it from one to the next

93
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,447
I really hope you know the through line for all the series is going to be

94
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,263
An original radiotopia incentives

95
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
Surprise air quality

96
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,335
And no matter what the topic is hope

97
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,871
Play people will tune in

98
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,431
I'm in your people thinking of it as a showcase

99
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
Experience

100
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,759
Just thinking about the series that comes up next Thursday

101
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,295
Really having this like

102
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,391
Comprehensive sense of what this offering is from radiotopia

103
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,999
Right I mean that's the thing I like about it cuz there's something about this where

104
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,351
You know hopefully you you get a little further into it

105
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
To judge

106
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
You know because

107
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,215
You trust the idea of the channel

108
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
Like it it means something

109
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
To be

110
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
A listener to

111
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
To showcase

112
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Ascenso

113
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,431
I'm just really intrigued by the new type of listening that might come out of that

114
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
That isn't based around

115
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Building

116
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
I had around

117
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
A single pot

118
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,879
You know we talked about radiotopia as the account of music label a lot and

119
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,415
So this is kind of like a

120
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
Compilation

121
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,255
Record LP to CD series

122
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
And so obviously

123
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,423
I have a few lined up like I don't want to spoil anything but can you talk

124
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
Being generally about the types of shows that are going to be on

125
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,055
Bring a kickoff with a very sort of essayistic

126
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
Sound rich

127
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:13,503
Series about listening in the digital age how listening has shifted for us through analog technology

128
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
Changing into transforming into digital technology

129
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,647
And this was proposed by a musician Damon Creek

130
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Ask who

131
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,791
Was in a band that I used to love Galaxie 500 and then Damon & Naomi

132
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:32,191
Yeah yeah I had to get over that to begin with when we started talking to him

133
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
But he has an ex-girlfriend

134
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Rating on iTunes

135
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:45,759
So this is a perfect example he's actually wrote a book about this

136
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:52,415
In the past year and we were talking about how that had to be a podcast it was about listening shifting from analog to digital culture how

137
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
How do you represent that through sound

138
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,791
And in a way that people can understand it wouldn't be too Technical and wouldn't be too

139
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,095
In a sort of intellectualize but I'm

140
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,727
How do how does he convey how lives are changing through these technological shifts and so

141
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,383
He came up with six different episodes of sort of based on the book but it's really departed from the book and become its own engines called ways

142
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
Days of hearing

143
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,503
And that's what we're going to kick off the Showcase with and I think there couldn't be a better

144
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,111
Starter series because it's really about how we listen how we listen in this age

145
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,695
And I really want to get people engaged with their ears and thinking about you

146
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,255
What is it about podcasting that they respond to

147
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
This is ways of hearing

148
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
Listening in the digital age

149
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
Radiotopia showcase

150
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,127
The first record I made was all analog

151
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
Wasn't a choice

152
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
That's just how it was done in Haiti

153
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,295
My friends and I lived in an all analog world

154
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
There were no computers in our lives

155
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
That didn't feel weird

156
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
It would have been weird if there happened

157
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
The time

158
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
Computers with something you saw on TV

159
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:06,911
During a moon shot

160
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,215
You suck people sitting at computer

161
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
Did NASA Mission Control

162
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
Ignition sequence start

163
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,407
Wasn't anything like a moonshot it didn't use numbers

164
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
Is data plural

165
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Involved

166
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,159
The tape decks mixing board microphones

167
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,719
They all seemed very magical

168
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
But they were made of magnet

169
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,815
Gears Motors electricity

170
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,887
Like all the mechanical objects in our lives then

171
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
And so my bandmates and I

172
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
Set up our instruments and Studio

173
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
Recounted off

174
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
And we played our songs

175
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
In many ways

176
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,831
It simply Nostalgia to think that it was so different

177
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
People Are People

178
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
Sounds of sounds

179
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
And our technology is always changing

180
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Still

181
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,071
There's something particular about that analog experience

182
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,399
Seems hard to conjure back up in the digital press

183
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
For that very reason

184
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
It feels important to try

185
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Human analog Studio

186
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,583
It was a feeling when the tape started rolling

187
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,887
That this was the moment we would capture

188
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
Feeling of time

189
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
Moving both more slowly

190
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
And more quickly than usual

191
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,431
Like when you're in an accident

192
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,831
Which split-second suddenly so palpable as if you're living in slow motion it would we say

193
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,927
It all happened in an instant

194
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
Analog recording

195
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
It's like an accident in other ways

196
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
Untape

197
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,607
There was no undue

198
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
You could try again

199
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
If you have the time and money

200
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
But you couldn't move

201
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Backwards

202
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
What's done

203
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Better

204
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
And worse

205
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Today

206
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,479
Life is a musician is very

207
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
In the digital Studio

208
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
I'm using one now

209
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
Everything you do is provisional

210
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,951
That is it can be redone reshaped

211
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Rebuilt

212
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
There's no commitment

213
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,351
Because each element of recording can be endlessly changed

214
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,423
You can even be conjured from digital scratch

215
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,263
And entered into a computer directly as data

216
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
Without anyone performing at all

217
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,295
This means there's no moment from lived experience

218
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
Is captured forever

219
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
Unalterably cell

220
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
The digital Studio

221
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,863
Which is why it's more than nostalgia

222
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,167
It makes me remember the analog Studio

223
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
It's different than what we know today

224
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
Because the digital era

225
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,335
Has not resulted or tools for working with sound

226
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Rematch

227
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
Removing images

228
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
It is changing our relationship

229
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
The time itself

230
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:43,487
This is ways of hearing

231
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
6 part podcast from radiotopia showcase

232
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,887
Exploring nature of listening in our digital world

233
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
I'm gaming Krakowski

234
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
Musician and a writer

235
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
In each episode

236
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:00,639
We'll look at a different way that the switch from analog to digital audio is changing our perceptions

237
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Time

238
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
Space

239
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
Love money

240
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Power

241
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,039
This is about sound

242
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,087
The medium we're sharing together now

243
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,903
But I'm worried about the quality of that sharing

244
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:16,511
Because we don't seem to be listening to each other very well right now in the world

245
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
Our voices carry further

246
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
Did they ever did before

247
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
Thanks to digital media

248
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
But how would they been her

249
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:30,591
Apus

250
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
I said one time

251
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
Musicians note

252
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
Time is flexible

253
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,111
Classical players call this tempo rubato

254
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,159
Italian for stolen time

255
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
You still a bit here

256
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
Give it back there

257
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:55,935
Jazz players called swing Rock and Funk players

258
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:02,335
Call a cruise this flexibility of time is something we're all familiar with

259
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
Whether or not we play an instrument

260
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,759
There's the time it takes for Don to arrive while you lay awake

261
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
After a nightmare

262
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
And there's the time it takes

263
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,111
You're out all night with your friends

264
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,207
What musicians terms like Votto swing and groove

265
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
Acknowledge

266
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
Is it time is experienced

267
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
Not counted like a clock

268
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,375
In our experience of time is very

269
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
It's always

270
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Changing

271
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,471
Even if our eyes look at a clock

272
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
Nc12 equal hours

273
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
Are ears

274
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
Are ready to steal a bit here

275
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
Give it back

276
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
Back there

277
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
The analog media

278
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
We used to reproduce sound

279
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
Records & Tapes

280
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,343
Select this variable sense of time

281
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
A time that's a last

282
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
The first turntables victrolas

283
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
Square hand crank

284
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,607
You wound up a spring

285
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,167
Spawn the platter as a wound down

286
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,959
Speed was hardly static

287
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
At least never for long

288
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
At the opposite end of the 20th century

289
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,759
Hip-hop DJs used speed controls on turntables

290
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
To change the tempo of a wrecker

291
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,111
Domatcha to another and keep the group going

292
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
Or in the studio

293
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,207
Pileup samples from older records

294
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
And make a new one

295
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,839
In 1990

296
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
A Tribe Called Quest

297
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
Sample Bass from Walk on the Wild Side

298
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
Along with the surface noise from the lp

299
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,311
Added it to a drum loop from a Lonnie Smith LP

300
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
And made a new hit out of

301
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
They also have to give up

302
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
Royalty

303
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
One of the

304
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Biggest samples

305
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
That

306
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,111
We were able to clear was the Walk on the Wild Side by Lou Reed

307
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
And

308
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,999
And by clearing that he just took 100% of that song

309
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
He did

310
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,935
That's Ali Shaheed Muhammad from A Tribe Called Quest

311
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
Frannie Kelley

312
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,287
They host a podcast about hip-hop called microphone check

313
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Yeah that's

314
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,967
This is song 500 we ripped off The Velvet Underground way more than you do

315
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,319
We didn't have to pay them in time

316
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,367
Diastole

317
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,927
How tribe use the variable speed of turntable

318
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
To make your own record

319
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,327
I know sometimes we would change the speed on a turntable because

320
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,399
Staple hip-hop turntable is good

321
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,239
Technics 1200 so that has a pitch control we would sometimes

322
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
Pitch it by there sometimes

323
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,127
A 33 RPM record you put it on 45

324
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
One thing with tribe

325
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
We layered

326
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:58,463
Certain sound and saw you kind of had to pitch them cuz often

327
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,999
They weren't in the same key

328
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
Layering sounds

329
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Tribe Called Quest

330
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,119
Discovered something else about their sample

331
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
The records we were recording

332
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,983
They might not have been playing to a metronome

333
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,591
And it would free-flowing so their moments with in let's say even a toolbar phrase

334
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:20,991
That may be a drummer or bass player like we're a line in the first two bars infratemporal seem to be consistent

335
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
The last

336
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:27,135
Three beats of a bar It sped up or slow down

337
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,791
1988

338
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,631
The songs My bandmates and I recorded slowed down and sped up

339
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
Just like always Shaheed described

340
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
I know because I was the drummer

341
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,055
Who played as steadily as we could

342
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,591
But this was a performance

343
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
We were nervous and excited

344
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
And we sped up at the Quarry

345
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,647
You might find that a Florida recordings

346
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
Or you might feel it's a part of their charm

347
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,815
Musicians have been speeding up at the chorus for as long I'm sure as there have been choruses

348
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
Our experience of time is

349
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Flexible

350
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,079
But not long after we recorded that first Galaxie 500 album

351
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
The commercial music world

352
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
For the most part

353
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
Decided that this was most definitely a

354
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
Flaw

355
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,247
Bands on major labels

356
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,831
Even bands who came out of our DIY Indie scene

357
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
Started recording to a click track

358
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
That is a metronome

359
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,279
Fashion to music come and go at the time

360
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,327
Everyone was also using the swirling effect

361
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
Call the flanger

362
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,703
No one remembers why

363
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
But the click track

364
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,519
Poop more than a fad

365
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
It was a change that stuck

366
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,407
Because what truly changed in popular music during the 1980s

367
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,991
With a digital machines enter the mix for the first time

368
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,551
A machine have a different sense of

369
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
Time

370
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:09,023
First drum machines to be widely used in commercial recordings were introduced in 1980

371
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
And MIDI

372
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,863
Musical instrument digital interface

373
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,959
The language machines used to share musical information with one another

374
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
Was launched in 1983

375
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
Together

376
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,103
These tools can lock musical time 2:00

377
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
Doesn't speed up

378
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Chorus

379
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
Galaxie 500 recorded we played our songs and what audio engineer is now referred to as real time

380
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,535
Real-time as the name implies is live time

381
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,607
Time as we experience it in the analog world

382
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
Digital time

383
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
Is not live time

384
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
It's machine time

385
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
It's locked to a clock

386
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,591
Annette clock the time code

387
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,895
Makes everything more regular

388
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
In live time

389
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,527
Time in the digital Studio

390
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,343
Is stored in discrete cells on a grid

391
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
Like figures on a spreadsheet

392
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,951
And if you've ever worked with a spreadsheet

393
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,303
You know those cells can be sorted any which way and we figured

394
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
To most any desired outcome

395
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:26,335
What this means is that a given experience a digital time is only one among many equally plausible

396
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
Experiences

397
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,919
Take this podcast you listening to

398
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,223
Since this is digital medium

399
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,015
You can choose to hurry me up

400
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,063
Without changing the pitch of my voice

401
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,647
Seemingly without changing any of my words or pronunciation

402
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,951
Which means I can be equally fast

403
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,767
Sitting at 1.5 times my normal Pace like a manic

404
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
Or

405
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,351
I can be equally slow

406
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,935
Speaking at 3/4 normal pace

407
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
Like I'm drunk

408
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,799
Neither newbie how this happened in real time

409
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
In fact

410
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,383
None of this need ever have happened

411
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,711
In the sense that we understood that term in 1988

412
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,391
That's a track meet entirely by software

413
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,951
The singer is a program made by Yamaha

414
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
Call Vocaloid

415
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,911
Vocaloid tracks have been cropping up in the Japanese pop charts

416
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191
Score number of years

417
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,519
And are now making their way into other forms of Music around the world

418
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,639
Casper podcast

419
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
Adobe is developing a program

420
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
Voco

421
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,759
That will read text aloud for you

422
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
In your own voice

423
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
What could possibly go wrong

424
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,999
Making thyme conform to machines making it regular

425
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,047
Would seem to make it more unify

426
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,351
Like a standardized timeline

427
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,911
That any of us can tap into at any moment

428
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
But there's acid

429
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
Surprising twist

430
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
Digital time

431
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
It's actually very difficult

432
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
Synchronize

433
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
It's a challenge

434
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
In digital recording

435
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
To whine up the different layers

436
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
That make up a song

437
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
If you play a guitar into a digital recorder

438
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343
And then play it back and add singing

439
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,391
Your voice won't line up with the music

440
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,696
Exactly the way you performed

441
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
The reason

442
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,024
Is what's called latency

443
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,608
Latency is the lag and digital Communications

444
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,400
Introduced by the time it takes

445
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,192
Computer to process them

446
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,032
Computers move very fast that's what computers are good at

447
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,336
But analog time it seems

448
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
Moves faster

449
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,480
Let's consider an example from outside music

450
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,064
Bulletstorm

451
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,624
That's the radio voice of the Boston Red Sox

452
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
Joe Castiglione

453
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:54,560
I don't have a signature home run call because all the good ones were take it and going going gone

454
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,864
Buybuybaby

455
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,192
Russ Hodges

456
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:04,288
I got kind of used forget about it and because are you know it's gone

457
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:10,688
Some fans didn't like that sweetheart forget about it's a big home run

458
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,504
Hello the broadcaster is to describe

459
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,624
What you see and what is happening as it happened that's why we broadcast in the present tense

460
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,696
Major deals and it's in there for a call strike

461
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,536
I can't be too soon anticipated you can get burn that way

462
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:30,144
Sometimes the ball doesn't carry as far as you think it's going through or sometimes it carries farther

463
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,008
You can always tell if a broadcast is behind the action

464
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,336
The crowds cheering and you're still building up to what's happening

465
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
You have to be quick you have to be current

466
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,432
You have to be right

467
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
On time

468
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,320
Joe is such an important voice here in Boston it used to be common practice

469
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,368
Watch baseball games on TV

470
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904
But with the sound off

471
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
And the radio on

472
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,488
So we can watch the game

473
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,048
The listen to Joe

474
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,352
And then a strange thing happened

475
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,400
On June 12 2009

476
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
Joe started calling a place

477
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,496
Before we saw them on TV

478
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
That's because on that day

479
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,104
Every TV station in the US

480
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,920
Switch from analog to digital transmission

481
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:18,272
And that lag in the Digital television image the gap between it

482
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,344
And the real time of the game as Joe is calling it

483
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
That latency

484
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,256
It takes time for computers to translate the world into Data

485
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
And translating data

486
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
The analog

487
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,608
So we can perceive it

488
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,656
Slows things down

489
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,448
Enough to put the tag

490
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,008
After the call by Joe Castiglione

491
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,104
Throw throw in time at his house

492
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,408
Was it all saying radio

493
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,968
When you read it it's history when you hear it it's news

494
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,808
And we're headed the satellite picture on TV so

495
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,088
We are first

496
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,648
And I think the immediacy of radio

497
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
Is something that

498
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
You're so critical and seoul

499
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
Jermaine to it

500
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
Back before digital broadcast

501
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,888
That immediacy was audible in the city

502
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,960
You always need when there was a homerun at Fenway

503
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,312
Because you heard of simultaneous Collective cheer all around Boston

504
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,128
From every open window to passing car

505
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,712
The news today

506
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,248
Those shots are staggered

507
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,552
We get splattering of Cheers

508
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,600
Like scatter points on a graph

509
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:32,512
That's because latency

510
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
He is different

511
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
Slightly different but different

512
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,472
On each digital device receiving its own particular stream of digital information

513
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:47,104
Professional music producers and engineers in the digital Studio

514
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,408
Worried about latency all the time

515
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,480
Black and introduces can be very very small

516
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
And yet

517
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
It's always there

518
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,624
And always threatening to knock the different layers of a song

519
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,672
Out of sync with one another

520
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
If a young drummer today

521
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
Managest

522
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,792
Cast wide net around beat

523
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,680
Perhaps that's not so different from my own speeding up and slowing down on Galaxy 500 recording

524
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
It may be a flaw

525
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
Or maybe part of the charm

526
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,104
If there's something very distinct

527
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,944
About an experience of analog time time that flexes

528
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Slower and quicker

529
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,040
Tempo rubato

530
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,112
And this feeling a blurred time

531
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
Vim latency

532
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
From one

533
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,512
I can't think of a musical term for latency

534
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,608
Perhaps because it's not like anything we experience in live

535
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
However

536
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,264
This experience of latency is typical of Life online

537
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,080
For all our seemingly instant

538
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,384
Global digital Communications

539
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,688
Life online is in practice

540
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,248
Field of chronological confusion

541
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:04,672
Social media like Facebook and Twitter Shuffle posts according to various algorithms most obviously

542
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440

00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
The net result being

00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
The Yesterday's News Bulletin

545
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,096
Can interrupted a string of think pieces about it

Texting to

547
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,448
It's often tripped up by cross posts

548
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
Or missed post

549
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
What abrupt silences

550
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,824
Followed by 10 things in a row

551
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:26,944
Temporal hiccups in information exchange that would never happen faced

00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:36,416
We can gauge reaction to her statements before anything further is sad

555
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,744
Pause without lapsing into silence

556
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,584
And we can fall silent without ending the conversation

557
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
Digital time

558
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,520
It's time to sign from machines

559
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:56,128
We benefit in all kinds of ways from the convenience that makes possible

560
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,432
But those conveniences

561
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
Kommersant

562
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,552
Because when we trade broadcast for podcast

563
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,880
We give up the opportunity to experience time together

564
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
Same insta

565
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,696
2R media

566
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,048
And when we trade real time for machine time in music

567
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:18,144
We lose the ability to share our individual timing with one another

568
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,752
Musicians use Roboto swing and groove

569
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,288
To move us together

570
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,312
Not block

571
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,872
But to one another

572
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,664
Analog time

573
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,712
Flexible but Unified

574
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
We share it so easily

575
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,088
Without tinkering with technology without even thinking about it

576
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,672
Maybe that's why we seem to be surrendering it so quickly

577
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
But without it

578
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,536
It's harder to share a moment in time together

579
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
Like those moments I want shared

580
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,120
With my bandmates

581
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,400
New recording studio

582
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,936
Particular place

583
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
At a particular time

584
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
On West Broadway

585
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
Just south of canal

586
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,312

00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:10,112
This is ways of hearing

589

The next episode

590
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,696
I'll take a trip to today's New York

591
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,024
And look at the effect of digital sound on perception of space

592
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:24,448
Thank you for listening

This series Waze. Reminded me of one of my favorite night night GIF episodes about music and Design

610
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,744
If you wanted people who never go through the back catalog

611
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,792
I thought I just resent it to you here

612
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,328
Short and fun

613
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
The first

614
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
I should pay some bills

615
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,192
Because thanks of These Fine sponsors

616
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,752
Yeah we're allowed to listen to all this for free

617
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,432
Between the beeps bongs and chatter of our devices

618
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
We're immersed

619
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,016
The cluttered World a man-made sound

620
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
If

621
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:49,440
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexa is talking to me and my wife isn't

622
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
Technology

623
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,072
You talk to us

624
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,376
It is a creation of Sonic trash

625
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,448
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

626
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:04,032
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

627
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
To make them more human

628
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
Turn the living room lights on

629
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
Okay

630
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,248
Dim the living room lights

631
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
50%

632
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Okay

633
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:22,464
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

634
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,768
Makes for a much more natural

635
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Experience

636
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,328
Turn the living room lights on

637
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,424
Dim the living room lights to 50%

638
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:40,128
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

639
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,920
Landscape is impacting our health

640
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,480
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

641
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,296
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

642
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Right here

643
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
NPI fate

644
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,952
We need to talk about something

645
00:30:54,208 --> 00:31:00,352
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet

646
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,168
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

647
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:09,568
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

648
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,872
Then it may be time to seek help

649
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:18,272

Five podcast

654
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,536
So this is very old man ipin

655
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,352
You can tell because I sound like a very young

656
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
And much less exhausted

657
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,192
But it's an all-time favorite

658
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
Enjoy

659
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,480
Goethe said that architecture is Frozen music

660
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
That's lovely

661
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,624
Of course that was before audio recording so now for the most part

662
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
Music

663
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,928
Is Frozen music

664
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:04,352
It's only very recently in the history of music that we've been able to freeze music into an object

665
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,192
In my life the form of is object matter to lie

666
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,520
I once bought vinyl albums and cassette tapes

667
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,104
And there were two first songs per album side a

668
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,920
Inside B

669
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,968
The energy of a first song

670
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,272
Made it stand apart from the other songs

671
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,552
At least my head

672
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:28,672
Then the CD came along and eliminated side B and there was only one first song

673
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:34,560
And the actual number of the track that you can see prominently displayed on the CD player URI

674
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,864
That became my index for sorting songs

675
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:41,728
An MP3 is jumbled my sense of track order and albums began to feel more like

676
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:45,824
A loose grouping of individual pieces rather than a conceptual hole

677
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,176
I can do this all day and you're welcome to try man let's just left totally has the sound of the waves

678
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,968
But my point is this

679
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,552
When it comes to music the form of the thing matters

680
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:02,208
But no effect has been his world changing as the original Innovation freezing Music In Time on

681
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:02,976
Recording

682
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,072
Or a single version of a song a single performance of a song

683
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
Became

684
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,376
The song

685
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,728
This inherently mutable method of communication

686
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,520
Was fundamentally changed

687
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,568
Songs

688
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,408
Astonishing things really

689
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,224
Even know what they are

690
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,064
That's the songwriter composer and producer Jon Brion

691
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
No I didn't talk to John Bryan

692
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,880
But I know people who did

693
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:36,256
Jim derogatis and Greg caught are the hotel radio program I'm a huge fan of called sound opinions

694
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,328
It's a rock and roll talk show and it's certain

695
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,144
Michy snarky corners of the internet

696
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,216
Have darkened or concept of Music journalism

697
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
What sound opinions

698
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,568
Is your beacon of light my friends

699
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,104
Anyway

700
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55,712
John Brian came to WBEZ in Chicago to talk to sound opinions in 2006

701
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
And at the time

702
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,528
Brian Tedesco produced

703
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,832
Kanye West album late registration

704
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:06,720
He was also already well known as a film composer of a lot of really great movies many by Paul Thomas Anderson

705
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:13,120
I heard the show broadcast on WBEZ while I was sitting in my car in a parking lot of a Taqueria in Logan Square

706
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,448
And I thought about this section of their interview about

707
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,752
Songs versus performances

708
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
At least

709
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
Once a month

710
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Since then

711
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,128
For 6 years

712
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,736
But only recently did it. I mean that this is a perfect 99percentinvisible story

713
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
So here it is

714
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,832
John Brian sound opinions in mm

715
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,904
I distinguish between

716
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:40,512
Look for lack of better terms I call songs and performance pieces

717
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,304
And

718
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
What most people like are specific

719
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,168
Performances we've grown up in an era of

720
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
Recording

721
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,776
Add to note the very thing one of the very things I love

722
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,056
Recording has

723
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:58,688
Killed people's ability to hear songs purely as core change

724
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
Melody and lyric

725
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
It's a very

726
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,832
Strange and beautiful art form cuz when it's right

727
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,856
Do you know it

728
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
But

729
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,928
What we have sort of Lost

730
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
Is

731
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,512
I don't have the best example I cried give would be

732
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Led Zeppelin

733
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,096
Those things are the ultimate performance

734
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,656
Pieces and I'm a big fan

735
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,472
I think they're just absolutely astonishing

736
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,544
The sort of Dynamics they had

737
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,080
Sorely lacking in music

738
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Today

739
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,640
Record making is

740
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
Great

741
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,248
A true band in the sense that you really could

742
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,040
Tell who the individual

743
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,112
Remarkable thing

744
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
And

745
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,184
I don't

746
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,744
Consider most of those things

747
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
Songs

748
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,608
And the way I can sort of prove my point is

749
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:54,496
Have you ever listen to anybody else play Led Zeppelin song and got all that was a great satisfying experience

750
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:58,848
Except for dread Zeppelin what people like

751
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,920
Specific guitar sound that specific performance

752
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,992
In concert with that specific drum sound with that

753
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,528
Pacific drummer playing that

754
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,552
Pacific Park

755
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,416
And it's beautiful it's a beautiful thing they're all different types of art

756
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,696
Creative expression

757
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
However

758
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,536
If I were to sit and go here

759
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:28,544
And I can play

760
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,360
Ghetto 30 others that that's the thing

761
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,200
You know I know it could sound like a snobbishness

762
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
It's not

763
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,760
I love these records

764
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,808
They're great

765
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
However it is

766
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
There's a difference between

767
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
Is that

768
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
Anna song

769
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,256
Say a Gershwin song

770
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,096
You could actually play in the style of Led Zeppelin and have it completely

771
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:58,496
Satisfied Spirits all the time

772
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:04,896
When you start playing Zeppelin songs in the style of the 1920s music it's suddenly it's late

773
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
Oh no it was about those

774
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,224
People in those people were in a

775
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,088
And it was great and I loved it but I considered a performance piece

776
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,112
I consider

777
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,416
A lot of rocks people listen to

778
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
To be

779
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
Performance

780
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
They're not

781
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
Necessarily song

782
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,816
I heard you had to tell him you work here recently in tears

783
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,096
Guy who's the songwriter

784
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,144
Comes into the band and goes

785
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:32,544
Here's the thing I've got and then they you know rock with holy hardness and and all the greatness they've got with

786
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,664
Part of what makes a band like Radiohead

787
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,760
Stand-out you know when that second record came out we all collectively went

788
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
Oh my God

789
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:47,136
Somebody actually songs in this guy's an amazing singer

790
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,720
Yeah I mean

791
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
Okay here

792
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
Google Music

793
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
Costco

794
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Was cool with

795
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,472
Punk rock

796
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
Popular he had it factor for

797
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
4 days

798
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
But

799
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
If

800
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:12,736
You take the average punk rock sound is that Same Led Zeppelin meltys another hated Zeppelin so much

801
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
1000

802
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:27,840
Punk songs there's a big difference between that

803
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:33,984
I mean

804
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,848
I can sit here on grand piano plan unaffected version and we can all go oh my God

805
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,432
My spine tingles anytime

806
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:47,552
Play that Melody over those core change

807
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:54,720
Different it's in the same realm is being able to go in

808
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:59,328
Where

809
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
Uno

810
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,424
I like most people I remember exactly where I was

811
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,960
First time I heard lithium

812
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,264
Remember back of the friends car

813
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,032
And it came on

814
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,312
And

815
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
I just

816
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,128
Freaked out I mean I was nearly in

817
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896

818
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,944

819

Better than everybody

820
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,344
It was so palpable like

821
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,904
That's one of the best chord changes I've ever heard

822
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,952
It absolutely as good as

823
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,512
Thelonious Monk or

824
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

860
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:16,032
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

861
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:20,384
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

862
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,736
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

863
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:29,088
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind

864
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
I think

865
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:36,512
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

866
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,840
Was found dead in my private gym

867
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,168
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

868
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:47,520
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

869
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,848
Now I need to clear my name

870
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:57,247
