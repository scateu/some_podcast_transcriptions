I'm Roman Mars

29
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
Trophies are hard for people to throw away there's actually a service in Madison Wisconsin

30
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
Trophies and turn them into new ones

31
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,960
Boys & Girls Club for the Special Olympics

32
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,288
Some of the trophies they get come from people who have passed away

33
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
They're surviving relative Center

34
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:55,200
And sometimes they're from people who are just tired of their trophies taking up space and their homes

35
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
In both cases

36
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:02,112
People will actually pay the shipping to Madison to avoid putting their trophies in the trash

37
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,928
Donna Gregg who runs the service with her daughter Janet

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,560
Said that sometimes people request to be told where their old trophies and up

39
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,376
Almost like they're donating an organ

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,216
Most of the time the materials that make them are cheap

41
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,288
But that's not how you measure the value of a trophy

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
There's a little trophy shop down the street from our office in Oakland it's small but bust my windows are

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,808
Stuffed to the brim with the words made of all kind of material

Julia Riddell runs this job along with her husband

And she's always moved by what people want engraved on their trophies

64
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344

66
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,976
And the sincerity and just the way that they can

67
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
Expressive

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,376
Cuz I am from the culture where people did not occur

69
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
Press the feeling

70
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704

00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,800
And it was not always appreciated by the people would

72
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Styx

73
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
Press sincerely

74
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Their feelings

75
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
Let alone having

76
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,248
Engraved and be displayed public

77
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
Russians just don't give out Trophies the way that we

78
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,392
Americans freaking love trophies

79
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,791
And some of the fanciest trophies and Juliet shop actually in the fanciest trophies in the world come from RSO

80
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,839
Owens & Company in Chicago

81
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,887
My father built the company

82
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
Figure wizard

83
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
Guinea pig figure that he manufactured

84
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,311
Free guinea pig breeding competition during the Great Depression

85
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,711
Guinea pig trophy

86
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Rsln

87
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
Companies that showed me around the factory

88
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,343
Like a real Bonafide Factory with big

89
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
Jones for the glass black

90
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,695
And wheeled carts full of castings and statuette

91
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,767
And rows and rows of industrial grade buffer

92
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
This is just

93
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
Song

94
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
What we

95
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,935
Did you hear they're massive showroom is full of

96
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,263
Crazy different kinds of trophies and Awards this

97
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
Westborough

98
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
This is the only time we made an award

99
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,151
With a built-in DVD player

100
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,479
Gimmicks aside RS Owens make some truly iconic

101
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Tropheus

102
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
HDMI over

103
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
Yes an Emmy Award

104
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,623
But the enemy is outshined by its neighbor

105
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
Can't believe that's a real

106
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
A real Oscar

107
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,583
The Oscars real name is the Academy Award of Merit

108
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
It is now officially known by its nickname

109
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,751
There's lots of Mythology around where the name Oscar came from the official myth

110
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,359
Is that the academy librarian Margaret Herrick took a look at the Statue and whispered

111
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,967
Looks like my uncle Oscar

112
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,063
The number of different factories have manufactured the Oscars over the years

113
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,391
Since 1983

114
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
When I saw the Oscar

115
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,767
It was hard to believe that I was looking at the real deal

116
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
Because I've seen so many knock off

117
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
The design itself isn't hard to imitate

118
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
It's really simple

119
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,471
It mostly just that stylize gold man standing on a real film

120
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,871
Actually MGM our director Cedric Gibbons originally designed the statue as a knight gripping at Crusader sword

121
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,735
And the Oscar has been purposefully designed to be as desirable an object

122
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
Possible

123
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,807
There's more gold on the Oscars

124
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
The other award

125
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
By fire

126
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,975
Also it's really healthy is 8 and 1/2 pounds

127
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,791
Crazy shiny lot of Polish goes into a rabbit

128
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Defect free

129
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,375
So that takes a lot of

130
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Topology

131
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
Night over an hour

132
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,775
Oh man when I saw it I just wanted it

133
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
He was like

134
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
I'm almost

135
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,175
But somehow Scott Siegel resist the urge to make one for himself

136
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
A lot of people

137
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
Ask me about whether I have an Oscar at home in Hurst

138
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,319
I'm surprised that I don't know I've never even been interested

139
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,903
That's exactly what he would say if he had an Oscar at home

140
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
But some people do make a words for themselves

141
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
People do

142
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
Make a voice for themselves

143
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Back in Oakland

144
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:04,959
Julie gets customers who don't look very athletic at all picking up trophies

145
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,055
Or elderly customers buying a trophy for being a young beauty queen

146
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
Or World Traveler

147
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
And this has happened multiple times

148
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Yes

149
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
It's a Coleman thing

150
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Julia is

151
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
So not judgmental about this

152
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,391
Giving yourself an award makes you feel better

153
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
She's all for it

154
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,975
It's a way of validating your own experience

155
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,303
And even more validating than making yourself in a war

156
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
Is making yourself

157
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
An entire awards ceremony

158
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
Welcome to MTV Music Television

159
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
Young MTV decided to establish a

160
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
With an award ceremony

161
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,919
Because that's a great way to quickly attract a lot of viewers get high ratings and bring in a lot of star power

162
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,479
And they wanted to further establish themselves

163
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
The really good trophy

164
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Impact Gorman

165
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
The Moon

166
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:00,767
At you that's silver astronaut given out at the MTV Video Music Awards or VMAs

167
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,863
Pat Gorman was part of Manhattan design The Firm that created the MTV logo

168
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
The making this trophy

169
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Fulfilled a longtime dream of hers

170
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
Open champion

171
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
Baton twirler with my sister

172
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,127
We have like a doubles routine and we have always a little war at home and I

173
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
I wanted to make a great

174
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
Trophy sometime in my life and then

175
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,295
The Manhattan design kicked around a few ideas

176
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
But eventually Pat realize it

177
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
The perfect trophy

178
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,695
Be a statue of a man on the moon

179
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Rock and roll

180
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,279
For those of you who weren't around Avery

181
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:39,679
MTV played a little station ID clip at the top of the hour

182
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,031
It was vintage footage of the moon landing instead of planting an American flag

183
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
The astronaut had a flag

184
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,359
But said MTV

185
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
What's your status

186
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
Statue

187
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
And

188
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
I also wanted to make the statue

189
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
You look like it was

190
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
Loading

191
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:01,183
Serpadesign an astronaut figure in a wrinkly Apollo suit balancing on one leg holding a little flag that's

192
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Said MTV

193
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
Seducing sketches

194
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
Santa gave them to a manufacturer

195
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
And then she comes back two weeks later

196
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
He says

197
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
Here's your statue

198
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
I look

199
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
Anything it was

200
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
There was a guy

201
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Standing with feet

202
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
Firmly planted

203
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
Are you saluting

204
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:23,455
Saluting just upping their pets like this is totally unacceptable you've got to follow my schedule

205
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
And the manufacturer goes back to work

206
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
We come back in a week

207
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,599
Now I see something even more bizarre

208
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,647
I see a man in a leisure suit

209
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,303
He's got this whole thing Smooths out there's not a wrinkle in the suit also this leisure suit moon man was

210
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
Still not on one leg

211
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
And the manufacturer insisted nope

212
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Can open it won't balance

213
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
William

214
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
One more

215
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,055
And that is like tomorrow

216
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
Who started building

217
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:59,807
Pat teamed up with a friend who is a Potter

218
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
And it balanced

219
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,647
There's a thing about balance where if you want to

220
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
Head

221
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,743
Center of the belly

222
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
You can balance in almost any pot

223
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
And so I just did that

224
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,191
For the manufacturer really didn't have a lot of time at this

225
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,751
The only got around to making five

226
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
Trophies

227
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,615
Right before the very first ever Video Music Awards

228
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,175
Any worse about 30 awards that we're going to be

229
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
What do we do

230
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:35,391
They decided that an usher could take each winter off the stage and sets the Moon Man each time and bring it back on stage during a

231
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,231
And this meant they could just keep recycling those same 5 trophies

232
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
Throughout the course of the night

233
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Will never run out

234
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
Until

235
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,311
What could possibly go wrong disaster struck

236
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,151
Michael Jackson Thriller

237
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
Michael Jackson wasn't there sadly

238
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,503
First one but he won all these Awards

239
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Diana Ross

240
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
Sitting in the front and she was accepting them

241
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
I talked to Michael

242
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
Today and he wants me

243
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Firstier Bank

244
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
Diana Ross right in the front row

245
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,863
Would go up and down the stairs before the Usher could take her off the stage and get the moon info

246
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,447
And filler kept winning more and more Awards

247
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
Michael Jack

248
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Acrylic

249
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
You weren't a lot in a row

250
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
She had all five statue

251
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
She's in her lap

252
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
So they sent an usher

253
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
Nick down to Diana Ross

254
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
The statues

255
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
And she starts fighting with him

256
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
Stand up as I remember

257
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
It was like a tug-of-war

258
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:43,743
And there's like a real disaster and the Moon Man tug-of-war got a little bit of air time

259
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
And it was embarrassing

260
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,815
But history is mostly forgotten it

261
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Because much

262
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,655
Crazier things have since happened at the VMAs

263
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,495
Thank you so much for giving me a chance

264
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:00,895
I'm really happy for you imma let you finish but Beyonce had one of the best video

265
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,967
Controversy has become its yearly tradition

266
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
The whole network

267
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:10,367
You know and I knew that if it was successful then would go on to become like a yearly thing of tradition

268
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
Which is actually

269
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
And the Moon Man

270
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
Stayed which is kind of amazing

271
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,279
Honestly now that MTV is without music

272
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
And almost without traditional television

273
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,167
This award ceremony has become a big part of MTV's identity

274
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:29,311
And by now they figured out how to get all the winners their own personalized awards for the sexy let harder to plan than you think

275
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,639
Especially when you get into the high-stakes of War like the Oscars

276
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Because

277
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
Back in Chicago

278
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,271
RS Owens doesn't know in advance who the Oscar winners are

279
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
So they've developed a smart solution

280
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,159
Because there's so few officers giving out and there so few nominees

281
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
We just grave

282
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
Play

283
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,559
And the academy can just quickly screw on the nameplate of the winter and destroy the other name

284
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
Effort but

285
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,679
Then the winners get to have awards that are already person

286
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,007
Because the most important thing about an award

287
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:04,127
Is that it has your name on it I think it was said that they did it the one word that's

288
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
Did the person

289
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,735
Would always prefer over all the other

290
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
Words in the vocabulary

291
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Is kidney

292
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
Dale Carnegie's principle number 6

293
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,135
How to Win Friends and Influence People

294
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Is

295
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,951
Remember that a person's name is

296
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
To that person

297
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
The sweetest and most

298
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
Important sound in any language

299
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,911
That goes a long way into the into the award business as well

300
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,775
That because people see their names not only hear it said but they actually see it engraved

301
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
Okay with that said

302
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:37,919
I'd like to present an award of recognition for producer of this episode 2

303
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:43,295
Avery trufelman

304
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855

Okay thank you thank you all

333
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
Between the beats

334
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,687
Bongs and chatter of our devices

335
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,271
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

336
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,695
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

337
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,791
All hearing that voice

338
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
Technology

339
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
She talked to us

340
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,631
It is a creation of Sonic trash

00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

342
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,287
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

343
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
To make them more human

344
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
Turn the living room lights on

345
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
Okay

346
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
Dim the living room lights to 50

347
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
2%

348
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Okay

349
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:26,975
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

350
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
Makes for a much more natural

351
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Experience

352
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,839
Turn the living room lights on

353
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
Dim the living room lights

354
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
