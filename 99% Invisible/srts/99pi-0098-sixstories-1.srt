16

All the various Kickstarter fulfillment details of which there are many

24
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,512
Thanks again for that Kickstarter that was pretty awesome

25
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
But even though we are up to our eyeballs in back office stuff I still want to play some grade radio for you in this week we have a story

26
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,240
My friend Nate dimeo of the Memory Palace

27
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
The subject is right in our wheelhouse

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
I thought you'd like it

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Elevators are old

30
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
It would have to be

31
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,576
Because it is in our nature right

32
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
To rise

33
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,720
So history even ancient history is thick with things that lift other things

34
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,048
Ropes and platforms and weights and pulleys

35
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
With people to pull them

36
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,216
When the slaves of Rome were served up to the wild beasts at the Coliseum

37
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,312
Other slaves pushed the wheels that pulled the ropes that lifted the platforms

38
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,128
It sent them up from the darkness below ground

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,944
Up into the sun and the Roar of the crowd

40
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
End of the line

41
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,832
In China and Hungary and mohsen Michelle

42
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,488
Where can I find monks in Kings in Porta Sans and construction materials and meals fit Four Queens and sorted cons

43
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
Rising up

44
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,864
Well some slave or servant or caged animal somewhere

45
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,472
Pull down some rope or push some piece of wood around and around and around

46
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:55,104
One man in France spent the year 1743 inside a chimney

47
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
Waiting for a bell to ring

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,968
So he could pull a rope through a pulley

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,552
Invoice King Louie the 15th up in a flying chair

50
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,600
Turn the ground to his bedroom balcony

51
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
Rather than have him walk up a single flight of stairs

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,304
Elisha Otis was too sick for the family business

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
He was a good-looking kid and smart as a whip

54
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,912
But he was kind of weak link

55
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:24,800
Did when he was 19 he moved away from the Family Farm in Vermont to figure out something to do for a living

56
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,616
Something where he wouldn't have to exert himself

57
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
Sell anything bought or processed

58
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
Process anything sold

59
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
Bought or processed

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,552
Lift heavy things

61
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,112
In a Furniture Factory

62
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:43,488
Where he and his co-workers spent their days sanding crews in decorative knobs in the bedpost

63
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,840
And Otis spent his nights designing a better way to do it

64
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,936
He invented a machine that kind of lady that sped up the process

65
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,776
Increase app but it made the men's jobs a little easier

66
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,384
And it opened up the aesthetic possibilities of the bedpost in new thrilling ways

67
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,968
Knobs upon knobs on knobs Pine knobs

68
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,320
In his boss was so impressed that he took him off the floor

69
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,928
And made him head engineer of the Maze and burns bad Factory of Yonkers New York

70
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,280
Sotus got to work trying to solve one of the biggest problems in the place

71
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
The factory had a list

72
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
Madden elevator

73
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,983
A lot of factories were starting to have them that these were simple machines

74
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,335
Just picture a platform that could be pulled off the ground up to a second-story on a chain

75
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,871
Or set of cables or ropes

76
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
Sometimes the rosary pulled by steam power winch

77
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,295
But the one in the Maze and burns bed Factory Yonkers New York was pulled by a draft horse

78
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:46,207
The Monday that horse is pulling on the rope which is pulling the wooden platform loaded with Lumber and tools after the second floor

79
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,119
In the Rope snapped the platform plummeted dropping 15 feet

80
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
Slamming down onto the floor

81
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
And onto one of the men below

82
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,567
Sending its cargo careening smashing into the scattering worker

83
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
Just a few years later

84
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
In 1843

85
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,551
Elijah Otis stood on a wooden platform

86
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
30 feet off the ground

87
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,463
The elevator was loaded with Lumber and tools and barrels

88
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
Just like the one it been that day in Yonkers

89
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,839
In Down Below on the floor

90
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
Did hundreds of gentlemen and ladies

91
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:30,239
Who didn't want to spend the night out on the town being crushed by construction equipment

92
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,127
They had come to the Crystal Palace exhibition to see the gathered wonders of the world

93
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,735
A massive structure of Steel and glass had risen in Manhattan

94
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
Where Brian Park is today

95
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,087
It was America's first World's Fair

96
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
And New York website

97
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,999
In the gentlemen and ladies after walking through the sculpture Gardens in the art galleries

98
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
Found themselves in a great hall

99
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
Filled with industrial equipment

100
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,655
And while they stood on the floor of the main hall

101
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
Moonlight streaming through the glass roof

102
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,567
Craning their necks to see Otis and his elevator floating in air

103
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,639
They may not have known that they were looking at the future

104
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
Because they had seen elevators before

105
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,575
In scene one Adventure after another come up with some new way to get from one floor to another

106
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
So here was one more

107
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
Admittedly he was higher than 18 before

108
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
A three stories instead of two

109
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,071
But there's no way this thing was going to catch on

110
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,423
Because who in their right mind was going to ride a three-story elevator

111
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,983
Fall from the second floor break your leg

112
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
You break your neck

113
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
So they wants Donuts

114
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,175
And watched his son nearby

115
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
Raise a sword

116
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:51,135
And then bring it down like an executioner slicing the ropes that held up the platform

117
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
Naughty screen

118
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
And then they cheered

119
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,935
Elijah Otis didn't invent the elevator

120
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
He invented the break

121
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:12,383
The little metal piece that catches the car and stops it from plummeting if the cable that holds it up

122
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
Stop holding it up

123
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
Elisha Otis invent the elevator

124
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
But his son's kind of invented the modern world

125
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,927
The Otis Brothers convince the world to aim higher

126
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:32,095
The tallest building back in the 19th century the tallest buildings that weren't churches or lighthouses which were all show off

127
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,119
Aspires anyway

128
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:38,495
We just a few stories tall in part these buildings were held down by the lack of engineering know-how

129
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:44,895
But just as much as they were held down by stairs people could only climb so many

130
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,247
So the brothers Otis came up with a killer sales pitch

131
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,551
Higher was better

132
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:58,207
They targeted hotels 1st and convince them to turn the idea of luxury quite literally

133
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,559
Before the elevator the best rooms are on the bottom floor

134
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
You didn't have to walk

135
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
Stairs are for suckers

136
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,239
But the oldest Brothers convince hotels it should be the other way around

137
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
The first floor is in the one on the street

138
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,871
With the hoi polloi and their noise in their sweat

139
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,175
Inner fruit carts taking in the Sun

140
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,759
In worse the horses in the things horses do

141
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,367
What's in a King's throne supposed to be higher than his servants

142
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,183
Wasn't a lord supposed to Lord over

143
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,511
Why shouldn't the wealthy traveler be above it all

144
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
Hotels

145
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Mayfield High

146
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,399
And Wealthy Travelers like The View

147
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,495
When it came time for them to build their next office building

148
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
They build hire Style

149
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
Nabozny Otis Elevator company

150
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
Building screw

151
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
Three stories to four

152
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
The sex

153
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,855
In the elevators group better and faster

154
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
To the Delight of passengers

155
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,255
Who love The Thrill Ride of hurtling 70 feet at speeds

156
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
600 ft per minute

157
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,351
Up to the penthouse on the 7th floor

158
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,263
But no the Otis safety elevator relieve them of the fear of falling to their Dooms it created a new concern

159
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,639
1G end up in the papers and in the esteem pages of the Scientific American

160
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,735
Which warned of the horrors of something called elevator sickness

161
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,783
Acute dizziness and nausea

162
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,367
Ode to the speeches fact that when an elevator comes to a stop

163
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,439
Not all of your organs stop at the same time

164
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
The best way to combat this it seems

165
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,679
What's the brace your head up against the ceiling of the elevator as it came to a stop so all of you

166
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Stopped at the same time

167
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,639
The regional headquarters of the Otis Elevator company in my hometown is a one-story building

168
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
I just always thought that was kind of funny

169
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
Another World's Fair

170
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:04,159
In Chicago in 1870 the crowd gathered to watch a dramatic demonstration of the latest in elevator

171
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Safety technology

172
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,559
Earlier that year a 7-story building in New York became the tallest in the world

173
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,911
And it had every architect in every illustrator in the Sunday circulars

174
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,727
Drawing up visions of the cities of the future

175
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:24,127
Gleaming Towers climbing soaring 11 and even 14 stories

176
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,247
I know people have grown to trust the Otis break at four and five stories

177
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
Would happen

178
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
If something happen

179
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
Anywhere after scraping the sky

180
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
So the fairgoers went out to a field

181
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:41,023
Where another inventor had constructed a temporary Elevator Shaft

182
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,327
This 109 ft tall

183
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,655
And they watched as passengers climb to the top

184
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
And step inside

185
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:55,615
Any watch that someone cut the rope to the elevator and it dropped plummeting for a few exhilarating

186
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Seconds

187
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
Before it came to a slow stop

188
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
Cushioned by a pocket

189
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
Prestera

190
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
In the crowd politely applauded

191
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:09,439
The outcome never having really been endowed what were the Wonders American inventors were coming up with all the time

192
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,535
And really they had seen this trick of the World's Fair before

193
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
They may be more excited however

194
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,703
And they know that the same technique had been tested in secret in Boston

195
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
Not long before

196
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
And when the elevator car holding eight volunteers

197
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
Dropped on command

198
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,175
The air pressure in the shaft That was supposed to Christian its descent

199
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
Blew out the walls of the Elevator Shaft

200
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,087
Leaving nothing to stop the free-falling car but Massachusetts oil

201
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
Many bones were broken

202
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
Lions path

203
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
For eyes

204
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
All eight of them nearly died

205
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,351
Something the eight volunteers who climbed into the elevator in Chicago

206
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
And control

207
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:59,359
The Burj Khalifa Tower Rises 2722 feet above the desert in Dubai

208
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,735
It has history's tallest and fastest elevator

209
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
I notice

210
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
It travels

211
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
30 feet a second

212
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,183
Continue 124 floors in about a minute

213
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:19,583
Reviewers have called The Experience mildly exhilarating

214
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,383
Six stories first appeared on the Memory Palace podcast by Nate dimeo.

215
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
Another piece from The Memory Palace

216
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,247
I called it a bridge to the Skynet called it a stretch

217
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
So while we're here to talk about how great The Memory Palace is

218
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,367
I thought I play that one for you too

219
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,999
Bradford Gilbert Hispanic we're close to the ground

220
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,887
At 23 he took a job is the architect for the New York Lake Erie and Western Railroad

221
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,679
It was 1878

222
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:00,287
The Western was basically just Western New York and just left of Lake Erie

223
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,103
We're Gilbert walk bridges in Dallas

224
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,199
Mapped its Contours and calculated its slopes and Rises

225
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:12,063
Built Bridges and trestles anyways to go over the river and through the woods

226
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,623
New routes for coming around mountains

227
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,463
As an older man he would redesign Grand Central Station

228
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,047
But his early 20s I'm designing West Grand buildings

229
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
West Central locations

230
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
In Avon in hornellsville

231
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,727
Oyster Bay in Toms River in Essex Falls

232
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,311
The places you waited to get places where things actually happened

233
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:40,991
But buy a ticket there for Manhattan or St Louis and you could see other Architects building more impressive things

234
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,111
You can disembark and Marvel at 6 and 8 and 10 story structures

235
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,463
Mammoth buildings of stone and brick in wrought iron

236
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
Holding court on whole city blocks

237
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,631
Like medieval fortresses made for the kings of the modern American Insurance industry

238
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,447
The Emperors of imports and exports

239
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,055
One of these was looking to expand its Empire

240
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,151
John Noble Stearns had made a lot of money important still

241
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,455
He was looking to make a lot more in real estate

242
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,527
He bought some land in a prime location to 50 Broadway

243
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,111
It was the perfect place for new office building downtown near the ports

244
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
In the heart of the growing financial industry

245
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
But there was a problem

246
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,047
The lot was less than 22 ft wide

247
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,631
There are rules that dictate what you can build and how

248
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:34,495
Rules of physics and rules of men who sit on various bureaucratic boards and bodies

249
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,407
And those rules dictated that if Stearns wanted to build one of those 10-story office towers that were all the rage in 1888

250
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,271
He would need to build walls of stone and brick that were 5 feet thick

251
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
With anybody windows

252
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,671
Am I left room for an interior that was only 11 feet wide

253
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:58,303
Place off a few feet for a hallway a few for bathroom couple for a coat closet

254
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,375
Another for some filing cabinets in an umbrella stand

255
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,983
And he would be asking the quintessential modern Titan of American industry

256
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
To work in a dark cell

257
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,847
Better suited for a monk Illuminating a manuscript

258
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,943
Stearns asked all the best Architects for a solution

259
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,295
They had built medieval Bell Tower come Manhattan Bank headquarters

260
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,879
Dad made Midtown hotels that look like Mountain fortresses

261
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
But what's turns wide

262
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
Weather Flagstaff

263
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,559
What Stearns wanted was a blade of grass

264
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,887
And they weren't in the blade of grass building business

265
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
They told him it couldn't be done

266
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
Everyone except Bradford Gilbert

267
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,591
The in-house architect for the New York Lake Erie and Western Railroad

268
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
Had an idea

269
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:49,503
Even the simplest train trip between two of his Backwater stations often required stunning Feats of engineering

270
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,623
Hundreds of tons of cars in cargo hurdle over thin trestles and bridges everyday

271
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,439
What if he turned one of those bridges

272
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,559
What if he was one of the steel frame that so capably carry trains

273
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
And built it up

274
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
Instead of out

275
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
He told Stern that if he did this

276
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
The walls wouldn't have to be 5 feet 6

277
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
They could be 9 in

278
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,127
I'm in the 20-foot wide office spaces that that would create

279
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,735
The quintessential modern Titan of American industry would have room to stretch out of legs

280
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,063
While he made out his rent check to John Noble Stearns

281
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,879
They would call it the tower building

282
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
Stearns love the idea

283
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
For a while

284
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,791
Until people started telling him it was completely bananas

285
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,863
First he heard it from business associates

286
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,655
People looking out for his investment

287
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,775
Then it was the Press which called the project in the men behind it idiotic

288
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:51,199
Architects came in from all over the country to watch the tower building rise to pour over Gilbert's blueprints

289
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,503
And they all pretty much agreed

290
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
Gilbert and strength radiates

291
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,623
The walls were just too thin the foundation was too narrow

292
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:05,279
Sure it was quintessentially Modern Men could stretch out their legs

293
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Boxers

294
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,423
But they could also be crushed to death when the first of wind came and blew the building down

295
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
Ask Gilbert to change the plans

296
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
Mira fused

297
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
He said he was so confident in his design

298
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,943
If you would move his offices to the top two floors of the building

299
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
The building

300
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,295
He would have the farthest to fall

301
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,855
In the longest time to consider his mistakes

302
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
Before he slammed into the pavement

303
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:37,791
The first if Winds of a hurricane blew into Manhattan on a Sunday morning in 1889

304
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,631
The tower building stood nearly complete

305
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,191
And people lined the streets to watch it tumble

306
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,567
By late morning the crowd numbered in the hundreds the Curious the morbid

307
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,127
The newspaperman who were professionally both

308
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,175
And as the wind roared

309
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735
The man pushed through the crowd

310
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,855
He walked to the base of the tower to a construction ladder and began to climb

311
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,695
When Bradford Gilbert reach the top of this Tower

312
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,535
Doing whip through its skeleton frame it more than 80 miles an hour

313
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,191
It was too strong for him to stand in the burgers that crossed in the center of what he helped would Sunday be his Penthouse office

314
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,775
It was too strong to look down at the crab

315
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:24,383
Two were probably placing bets on whether he would die by being blown off the building

316
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
Or simply in the crushing force of its collapse

317
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,759
But he crawled out to the center of the building

318
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,879
Import from a bag rope with a red wave attached to one end

319
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
Beside the other end to a girder

320
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,535
Cintas the weight down for the empty cells below

321
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
When he got to the ground

322
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
He looked up

323
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,239
Saw the lead weight hanging in midair

324
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
Stockstill

325
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,103
Held up by a building that wasn't going anywhere

326
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,943
The next day the papers called Gilbert

327
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
An idiot

328
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,015
And it's time you probably deserved it

329
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
They admitted his idea was genius

330
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,135
And 4 years after

331
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,231
Gilbert gets hit in his Penthouse office in the tower building

332
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,303
And he can look out of his large window

333
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Stretch out his legs

334
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
And watch a whole city

335
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,423
Stretching ever hire

336
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,983
As it took his idea

337
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
And built on it

338
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,687

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world

343
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,039

It is a creation of Sonic trash

That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

Turn the living room lights on
