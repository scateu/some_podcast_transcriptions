We get support from UC Davis globally ranked University

This is not 99percentinvisible

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,744
But I am Roman Mars

10
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,048
So I created a secret

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,328
Side project podcast

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,096
Sex with a friend of mine

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,168
The goal was to take some of my anxiety

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,704
About the political news

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
And turn it into something

16
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,008
Destructive

17
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,824
And fun and interesting and share with me

18
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,616
Hope you like it

Hope you tell all your friends

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,992
Let's send it to the top of the charts that would be nice

22
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,040
I want to take all of this energy

23
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,832
And do something good

24
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,136
Like learning the US Constitution

25
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,928
So here's the introductory at

26
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
The whole idea for the series

27
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
Just came from a tweet

28
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,424
It was by Elizabeth Joe she's a professor at the UC Davis School of Law

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,496
And I know her personally because our kids go to the same Elementary

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,128
Elizabeth tweet red and I'm paraphrasing a little bit so it sounds better when I read it out loud

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
Teaching constitutional law in 2017 mean

32
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,528
Glancing at Twitter every 5 minutes before class

33
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,320
First I laugh

34
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
Then I retweeted

35
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,880
And then I wondered

36
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,928
What is that mean exactly

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,000
I mean I kind of have an idea what constitutional law is

38
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
It's a class that sometimes called the structural aspect of the Constitution mention law professor Alyssa

39
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,704
How so I talk about things like

40
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,824
A separation of powers what are the different powers of the president vs. Congress

41
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,872
I also talked about federalism

42
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
So how much

43
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,480
Power Congress has as opposed to state

44
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,040
It's nothing about that usually require me

45
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
If you're going to be a lawyer

46
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,368
It's a class I love teaching a lot

47
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,928
I admit that not every student loves it

48
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
And I can see why

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,816
For example the very first case I assign on the first day of class

50
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
Every year

51
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,912
Is a case that was written in 1803

52
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,264
It's called Marbury versus Madison it's a big deal and we'll talk about it at some point

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
You need to know right now is

54
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592
Is it the first sentence of that case

55
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,432
Is 60 words long and the verb comes in the middle

56
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,736
So it's pretty dry

57
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
This year's been a little bit different

58
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,976
This is what Trump can teach us about con law

59
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
An ongoing series of indefinite length

60
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,120
Where we take the extreme actions of the chief executive of the United States

61
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
In channel that chaos

62
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,704
Little Learning our constitution

63
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Like we never have before

64
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm your fellow students and host

65
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Roman Mars

66
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Coming up

67
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
We're going to law school

68
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,480
But in a fun way and it's meant for everybody

69
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
Converse

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
We got to pay some bills

71
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
I'm still can be cheaper in Moscow

72
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
Support for Trump con law comes from Squarespace

73
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,560
As you can tell from the existence of this side project podcast of mine I like to take on new creative projects just because

74
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
I can't help myself

75
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,728

82

It's all one word

83

Squarespace.com

84
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
Con law

85
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,352
So the bread-and-butter of law professors

86
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Are hypothetical

87
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
Professors love

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,240
Crazy things that happened that they serve

89
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
Think about in their minds what if

90
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
What could happen

91
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,224
And so it's the sort of thing that is not realistic always but it's a way to get law students to think about

92
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
What are the limits of the law

93
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,184
Here's a crazy hypothetical former president sue a sitting president for libel for making

94
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
False statements synonym

95
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,375
Possible but it is possible in this new reality that's not a crazy hypothetical

96
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
President Trump tweeted

97
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,263
That President Obama had illegally tattoos phones during the election process

98
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,567
He said it was at the level of Watergate

99
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,871
And he called him a bad or sick

100
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Guy

101
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,711
Doesn't appear to have any proof but that's what he tweet

102
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,039
And this new window into the mind of

103
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,367
Trump has changed the way Professor Joe prepares for class

104
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
Before this year when I

105
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Prepared to teach

106
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
Each day's class

107
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,999
Constitutional law

108
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
Typically I would

109
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,095
Read what I had assigned

110
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,399
Look through my notes from the previous year

111
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
Go teach class

112
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Her procedure

113
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
A little bit different this year

114
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,311
This year I had a little ongoing note to myself

115
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,663
Do not go to class until I have checked whether the president has tweeted

116
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,967
If the president has tweeted

117
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
Screenshot the tweet

118
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
And discuss

119
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
Swift class

120
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:16,671
Roman when you brought up the idea of having some basic explanations about,

121
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
I thought what a terrific idea

122
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,535
There are so many constitutional issues

123
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
This presidency has brought up

124
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,911
Whether you're testing mathematical models were automobile crash

125
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,959
Cuz I think you can learn a lot about something

126
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
By testing the extreme

127
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,127
So I like this idea that maybe we have a president just kind of stress testing the concert

128
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,687
Really giving us in a sense of

129
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
What are the limits of each of the different Provisions that

130
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
He seems to be

131
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Challenging in the car

132
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
And that's

133
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
It's really important because it turns out

134
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
It's forcing us to think about things

135
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,023
And wonder well do we have answers to some of these questions

136
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
For example

137
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,887
When can Trump treat the presidency like The Apprentice

138
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,031
And declare you're fired when can the administration declare it's going to cut off funds to Sanctuary cities

139
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
When the president

140
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Talks about

141
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
So-called courts

142
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,919
Should we be worried about that

143
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
Should be worried that the salad yet

144
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,783
But we'll do an episode about it nonetheless

145
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
Is that going to happen

146
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,367
I think it's actually practically pretty unlikely

147
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
But Everybody's Talkin

148
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
And wondering about this portion of the Constitution

149
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,743
So it's important to understand what it's about

150
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:30,399
Maybe even more interesting is that we're dusting off part of the Constitution that people hardly even considered

151
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
A hundred years

152
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
For example

153
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
President Trump just went

154
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
Overseas

155
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,103
He got a gold medal in Saudi Arabia

156
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,151
Can you keep that shiny gold medal

157
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,247
Is that the kind of thing that's barred by the emoluments Clause of the Constitution

158
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,831
What about owning the Trump Hotel or property in other countries

159
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,695
Plus there's this hardly considered part of the Constitution that Liberals are salivating over

160
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,791
Could a president be declared unfit to serve and then removed from office

161
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
That's the 25th

162
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,679
These questions don't generally make it into the basic constitutional law textbook

163
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
Because really no one has cared about them before

164
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
They're not relevant that's the basic answer

165
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
It's kind of relevant now

166
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
So this is a real opportunity

167
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
I think

168
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,759
When it comes to the Constitution this should be a moment to care a lot about the concert

169
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
And it's not an onerous task

170
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
It's short

171
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
It's less than 5000 words

172
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,719
You know we're both Californians here so I'll give you an example to California

173
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:32,863
The California Constitution is 100 pages long it's one of the longest in the world

174
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,167
So by contrast the Federal Constitution

175
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
You can read in one sitting

176
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Freezing

177
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
It's also remarkably stable.

178
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,359
The Federal Constitution has only been changed or amended

179
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
27 *

180
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
I'm really only 17 times since the first

181
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,015
Can the Bill of Rights were ratified very shortly after the original

182
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,623
California Constitution we love changing stuff we get tired of

183
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,951
We've actually change their state constitution over 500

184
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
California

185
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,351
So what's my confusion here it turns out that in 2017 I've decided

186
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
That Trump

187
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
Can teach you a lot

188
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
,

189
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,007
So we're going to learn the Constitution together

190
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
Because of trump

191
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,591
Because I need something to hold onto

192
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
The Constitution

193
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
Is the life raft

194
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
Our forefathers gave us

195
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
Dammit

196
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
I'm going to learn how it work

197
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,599

This season

209
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:13,215
On what Trump can teach us about con law

210
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,031
Refers to the Judiciary as so-called

211
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
He really raises a question about

212
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
Judicial legitimacy

213
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,943
It's going to take us back in time to Youngstown Ohio President Truman and the Korean War

214
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
President Trump has threatened Sanctuary cities

215
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:31,135
Why is that even an issue for the federal government to talk about that's because of the spending clause

216
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,279
Trump wants to build a border wall and we're still not sure who's going to pay for it but one thing that's absolutely clear

217
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,119
Is it if you're going to build a physical wall along the Southern United

218
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
States

219
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
You have to take people's private

220
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,007
And that involved the takings clause

221
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,591
We are probably going to get a lot stricter with the Border

222
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
In all kinds of places not just

223
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
List the physical border of the United

224
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
But also at International Air

225
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:02,623
And many more people are raising concerns that their cell phones and laptops are

226
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
We're getting looked at

227
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Buy border

228
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,255
What happens when you are asked to provide the

229
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,303
The contents of your cell phone or lap

230
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
Why can that happen

231
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,679
Can it happen that has to do with the Fourth Amendment so-called border.

232
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,543
