Unlock its full potential

The death ray

73
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
It starts with an attempt

74
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
That's right

75
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,808
This was back in 1935

76
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
Officials in the British Air ministry will worried about falling behind Nazi Germany in the technological arms race

77
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,512
The death ray idea

78
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
Intrigued

00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:23,167
Pepino freeing a thousand pound price for anyone who could zap a sheep at a hundred paces

80
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
So far

81
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Nobody can find it

82
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,543
But should they fund more active research

83
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
Was at death ray even possible

84
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,431
I'm officially they sounded out Robert watson-watt

85
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,223
At the radio research station

86
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,807
And he post an abstract math question to his colleague

87
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
Skip Wilkins

88
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Supposed

89
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,903
Just suppose

90
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
Said watts and Watts to Wilkins

91
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
Do you had eight points of water

92
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
One kilometer above the ground

93
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,631
And suppose that water was it 98 degrees Fahrenheit

94
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,447
And you wanted to heat it to 105 degrees

95
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,543
How much radio frequency power would you require

96
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
From a distance of 5 km

97
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,151
Skip Wilkins was no fool

98
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,991
Can you the 8 pints with the amount of blood in an adult human

99
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,551
98 Degrees with normal body temperature

100
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
105 degrees

101
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
With woman after

102
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,927
The kill you or at least make you pass out

103
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
Which if your behind the controls of an aeroplane

104
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
Amounts to much the same thing

105
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,863
So Wilkins and watson-watt understood each other

106
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,679
And they quickly agreed that the death ray was hope

107
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
It would take too much power

108
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
Level 6 or an opportunity

109
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,615
Chile the ministry had some cash to spend on Research

110
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,967
Perhaps Watson Watson Wilkins could propose some alternative way

111
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
Suspended

112
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
Wilkins pond

113
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
It might be possible

114
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
He suggested

115
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,415
To transmit radio waves into Tech

116
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439

Long before they could be seen

119
00:05:54,303 --> 00:06:00,447
What's in Vault dash of a memo to the M Industries newly-formed committee for the scientific survey of Ed

120
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,799
Would they be interested in pursuing such an idea

121
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
They would indeed

122
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,735
Skip Wilkins with describing became known as radio detection and ranging

123
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
And then

124
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,415
Is radar the Germans the Japanese and the Americans independently started

125
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:26,815
My 1940 it was the Brits who made a spectacular breakthrough

126
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
The resonant cavity magnetron

127
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,447
A radar transmitter far more powerful than its predecessors

128
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:38,079
Pounded by German bombers Britain's factories would struggle to put the device into production

129
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
America's facts

130
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
British leaders plotted to use the magnetron as a bargaining chip for American Secrets in other fields

131
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,695
10 Winston Churchill took power and decided the desperate times call for desperate measures

132
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,023
Britain would simply tell the Americans what they had

133
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
Alaska help

141
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
Radlab was a resounding success

142
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439

Help to win the war

146
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,911
Urgency in times of War can quickly be lost in times of peace

147
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,263
Obvious if you thought about it that civilian Aviation needed radar

148
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
Given how quickly it was expanding

149
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,383

00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
It was 38 million

154
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,415
And the busy of the sky's the more useful radar would be by preventing Collision

155

00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Presumably

186
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Sewer clown

187
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:35,487
Investigators speculated both Pilots were distracted by trying to find gaps in the clouds

188
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,535
So passengers could enjoy the scenery

189
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
Accidents happen

190
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,031
The question is what risks we are willing to run for the economic benefit

191
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,639
Got questions becoming president again with respect to crowded Skies

192
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,479
Many people have high hopes for unmanned aerial vehicle

193
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Drones

194
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,343
I'm already being used for everything from moviemaking to crop spraying

195
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,439
Companies like Amazon expect the skies varsity's soon to be buzzing

196
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
Grocery delivery

197
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,303
Civil aviation Authority the grappling with what to approve

198
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
Drones have

199
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
Sense and avoid technology

200
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
It's pretty good

201
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
But is it good enough

202
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,359
The crash over the Grand Canyon be concentrated Minds

203
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:28,991
If technology existed to prevent things like this shouldn't we make more effort to use it

204
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,599
Within two years what's now known as the Federal Aviation Administration

205
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
Was born in the United States

206
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,207
And today American Skies

207
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
20 * busiest ill

208
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,119
The world's biggest airports now see planes taking off and Landing

209
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
An average of nearly two a minute

210
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,287
Collisions are absurd

211
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
That sucks too many things

212
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
But it's largely

213
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
Things to write

214
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:07,135
You're listening to my personally curated selection of stories from Tim Harford 50 things that made the modern economy

215
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Come next

216
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
Lee Aspen

217
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
Gentility of speech is at an end Sundays in editorial in London

218
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
City Press

219
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
Stinks

220
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:31,967
The stink in question was partly metaphorical

221
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,551
Politicians with failing to tackle an obvious problem

222
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:41,951
Population London system for disposing of human waste became woefully inadequate

223
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,511
Do any pressure on cesspits

224
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
Which were prone to leaking

225
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,119
Overflowing and belching explosive methane

226
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,471
The authorities had instead started encouraging sewage into gullies

227
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
Different issue

228
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,359
The original intended

229
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
Directly into the River Thames

230
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
So that was the literal stink

231
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
The Thames became an open sewer

232
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,951
The distinguished scientist Michael Faraday

233
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
To write to the Times newspaper

234
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,327
He described the river water as an opaque

235
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
Pale brown suit

236
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:26,239
Near the pictures the feculence rolled up in clouds so dense that they were visible

237
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
Cholera with Rye

238
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,127
One outbreak killed 14

239
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
Styles in London

240
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
Steely one in every hundred

241
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,015
Civil engineer Joseph bazalgette

242
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,831
Drew up plans for new close to us

243
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
The pump the waist

244
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
Far from the city

245
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,231
It was this project the politicians came under pressure to approve

246
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:57,215
Michael Faraday ended his letter by pleading with those who exercise power responsibility

247
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
To stop neglecting the problem

248
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,871
Last offseason gives a sad proof of the Folly about carelessness

249
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
In three years later

250
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
That's exactly

251
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
What happened

252
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,527
The sweltering hot summer of 1858

253
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,623
Made London's malodorous River impossible to politely ignore

254
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,207
Want to discuss a Bleakley with gentility of speech

255
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
The Heatwave

256
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,535
Became popular

257
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
The great stink

258
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,679
If you live in a city with Martin Sanitation

259
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:33,567
It's hard to imagine daily life being permeated with a suffocating stench of human excrement

260
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
We have a number of people to thank

261
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,711
Perhaps none more so than the unlikely figure

262
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
Alexander

263
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Coming

264
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
Watchmaker in London

265
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
Century before the great stink

266
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,927
Coming one Renown Titan Mastery of intricate mechanics

267
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:54,559
King George the third commissioned him to make an elaborate instrument for recording atmospheric pressure

268
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
I deposited a microtone

269
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,983
A device for cutting ultra-fine slivers of wood from microscopic analysis

270
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,055
Bart Cummings will changing invention

271
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
Oh nothing to Precision Engineering

272
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
Elizabeth pipe

273
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
With a caravan

274
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
In 1775

275
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
Coming Tyson Kidd

276
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Aspen

277
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
This became the missing ingredient

278
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Create a flushing toilet

279
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
And with it

280
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
Public Sanitation

281
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
We know it

282
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,583
Flushing toilets have previously founded

283
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
On the problem of smell

284
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,191
The pipe that connects the toilet to the Sewer

285
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,751
Alarm in urine and feces be flushed away

286
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,823
Will also let sewer odors walk back up

287
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
Unless you can create

288
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
Some kind of airtight seal

289
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,759
Coming solution was Simplicity itself

290
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
Bend

291
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,367
Water settles in the dip

292
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,903
Stopping smells coming up

293
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
Flushing the toilet

294
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
Replenishes the water

295
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,095
Well we've moved on alphabetically from the S Pen to the u-bend

296
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,167
Flushing toilets still deploy the same inside

297
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
Roll out

298
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
Came slowly

299
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,103
1851 a lifetime after cumming Peyton

300
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,455
Flushing toilets from a novel enough in London to cause Mass excitement

301
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
When introduced at the great exhibition in Crystal

302
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Show Palace

303
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,087
Use of the facilities cost

304
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,111
One penny

305
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:26,975
Giving the English language one of its engineering euphemisms emptying one's bladder

306
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
To spend a penny

307
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,959
If the great exhibition gave London is a vision of how public sanitation could be

308
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,007
Clean and smell free

309
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,591
No doubt I did to the weight of popular discontent

310
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,943
Politicians drag their heels over finding the thumbs for Joseph bazalgette

311
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
Plan suicide

312
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,551
We still haven't reliably managed to solve

313
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
The problem of

314
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
Collective action

315
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,695
How to get those who exercise power or have responsibility

316
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
To organize themselves

317
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
It's been a great deal of progress

318
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
According to the World Health Organization

319
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,935
The proportion of the world's people who have access to what school

320
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
Improved Sanitation

321
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,287
Is increased from around a quarter in 1980

322
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
Two around tooth

323
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Today

324
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,895
That's a big step forward

325
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
But still

326
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,247
Two and a half billion people remain without

327
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
Improved Sanitation

328
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,831
And improved sanitation itself

329
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
Is a lowball

330
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,463
It hygienically separates human excreta from Human contact

331
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,535
Who doesn't necessarily treat the sewage itself

332
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,143
Fewer than half the world's people have access to sanitation systems that do that

333
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:48,383
The economic cost of this ongoing failure to roll out proper sanitation a many and varied

334
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
From Health cafeteria real diseases

335
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,271
Two full-grown revenue from hygiene conscious tourists

336
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,367
It will Spanx economics of Sanitation initiative

337
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
Gastritis

338
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
About the price tag

339
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,743
Across various African countries for example

340
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,351
Attractions in adequate sanitation one or two percentage points

341
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
Of GDP

342
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,679
In India and Bangladesh

343
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Over 6%

344
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
In Cambodia

345
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
7%

346
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
Hatsune jump

347
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:23,199
The challenges that public sanitation isn't something the market necessarily provide

348
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,527
Toilet cost money but defecating in the street

349
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
It's free

350
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,879
If I install a toilet iPad only costs

351
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
All the benefits of the cleaner Street

352
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
I felt by everyone

353
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,999
In economic parlance

354
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
That's a positive externality

355
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:44,447
I'm good switch have positive externalities tend to be bought at a slower Pace than society as a whole

356
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,543
Contrast say the mobile phone

357
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
But also cost money

358
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:54,431
But as long as there's somebody else I can phone its benefits the crew.

359
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Tumi

360
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:00,575
Not one reason why the S Pen has been around for 10 times as long as the mobile phone

361
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,647
Many more people already own a mobile phone

362
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
Then a flushing toilet

363
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:11,071
If you want to buy a flushing toilet it also helps if there's a system of suicide

364
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,167
I creating that system is a major undertaking

365
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,823
Financially and logistically

366
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,199
Finally got the cash to build London sewage they took 10 years to complete the necessitated digging up

367
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
2.5 million cubic meters of Earth

368
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,575
Because of the externality problem

369
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,647
Such a project might not appeal to private investors

370
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,463
It tends to require determined politicians

371
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
Winning tax

372
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,303
And well-functioning Municipal governments

373
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
And those it seems

374
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631

00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
They finally acted they didn't hang about

377
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
It took just

378
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,895
18 days to rush through the necessary legislation for Bible Jets plans

379
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,735
What explains the sudden impressive alacrity

00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Geography

Soaking the curtains in chloride of lime

385
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
In a bid to mask the stench

386
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
But it was no use

387
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
Try as I might

388
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,471
Politicians couldn't ignore

389
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
The time described

390
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
With the notes of grim satisfaction

391
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
How members of parliament

392
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,431
Have been seen abandoning the buildings Library

393
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,503

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

400
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,287
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

401
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
If

402
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:03,711

To make them more human

409
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
Turn the living room lights on

410

Dim the living room lights to 50%

412
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Okay

413
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,991
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

414
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,807
Makes for a much more natural experience

415
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
Turn the living room lights on

416
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,951
Dim the living room lights to 50%

About how are soundscape is impacting our health

419
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,751

99% invisible

423
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,391
I found Rome a city of bricks

424
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
And left it

425
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
A city of ma

426
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,608

Just over 2000 years ago

429
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
If it was

430
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
He was exaggerated

431
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,848
Ancient Rome is a city of brick

432
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
No less glorious for that

433
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,784
Augustus was also joining a long tradition

434
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,832
Denigrating or overlooking

435
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,392
What are the most ancient and versatile

Well

443
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:13,504
Diderot doesn't trouble himself to include any images of brick breaker

444
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
A tool

445
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
That's because a brick

446
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,136
It's such an intuitive thing

447

Once boasted that he could make a brick

Worth its weight in gold

There's something between 9600 and 10300

497
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
Years old

498
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
I just simply lobes of Nod

With Mormon

501
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,952
The next big step forward

502
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
What's the simple brick mold

503
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,560
Also originating from Mesopotamia

504
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,864
At least 7000 years old

505
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,656
And depicted with great

506
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,216

508
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,800
The brick mold is a wooden rectangle

Full sides but no top or bottom

510
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,688
In which clients draw could be packed to make bricks

511
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,736
Faster and more precise

00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,368
They predate the use of metal itself

514
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,976
It was constructed much cheaper and better

515
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,072
Even in a dry climate

516
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,888
Sun-dried mud bricks do not usually last

517
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,704
V brakes are much more durable

518
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,752
Best stronger and waterproof

519
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,312
Making such Breaks by

520
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,104
Heating clay and sand.

521
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,920
The temperature of about 1000 degrees Centigrade

522
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,480
It's been possible for many thousands of years

523
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
.

524
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
At a price

00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
Notes that you can get

528
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,768
14400 mud bricks

529
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072
For the price of a piece of silver

530
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,888
Ugly 504

531
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,168
Fired clay bricks

532
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
An exchange rate

533
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,496
Amelie 29 mud-brick

1500 Years Later by Babylonian times

536
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
Kiln Technologies how to improve

537
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:59,296
And the price of five clay bricks that fall into between 2 and 5 months

538
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,136
That's still too much for many people

539
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
Cheap and easy mud bricks

540
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,024
Still perhaps the most popular material in the world

541
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,560
The building houses

542
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:15,424
But as the economist Abhijit Banerjee and Esther duflo observe

543
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:20,544
5 bricks can be an effective way for a very poor household to save

544
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,336
If you have enough money

545
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
Buy a brick

546
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,432
Slowly slowly slowly

547
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,968
You'll have about the house

548
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,648
The brick is one of those old technology is like the wheel

549
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,672
Paper

550
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:43,072
That seems to be basically unimprovable the shapes and sizes

551
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,888
The breaks do not differ greatly

552
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,544
Edwin Thompson in the 14th Edition of his rudimentary Treatise on the manufacture

553
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Bricks and tiles

554
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
There's a simple reason to psi

555
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,688
It has to fit in the human hand

556
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
As for the shape

557
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,528
Building is much more straightforward

558
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
If the width

559
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
Is half the length

560
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:10,976
That's why if you get your nose close up to some buildings

561
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Culture

562
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,792
The minarets of Columbus

563
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,816
Uzbekistan

564
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,120
Decimals so costly in England

565
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,936
And the twin pagodas of Suzhou in China

566
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
You'll find the brick

567
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
Acceptable much the same

568
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,592
It's precisely the uniformity of the brick

569
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,384
It makes it so versatile

570
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
Many medieval buildings

571
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,528
Talk shows since Alban's cathedral in England

572
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
Simply reused

573
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
Roman bricks

574
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Why not

575
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:43,488
Brick production still uses traditional methods in many parts of the world

576
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,328
Automation is gradually losing its way in

577
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,888
Hydraulic shovel dig the clay

578
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,728
Slow conveyor belts carry bricks to long tunnel Kilns

579
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,264
Forklift trucks

580
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,824
Shift Precision stock pallets of bricks

581
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,128
Oldest makes the brick itself

582
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
Building sites

583
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
I've resisted automation

584
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:09,600
The weather in the unique demands of each site require well trained workers

585
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:16,256
The bricklayer has long been celebrated as a symbol of the honest Dignity of skilled manual labor

586
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:20,608
Bricklaying tools have barely changed since the 17th century

587
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,680
But as in so many other profession

588
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
That all signs

589
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
Stop the robots

590
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
Maybe coming to Brookline

591
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
A human bricklayer

592
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,896
A300 600 bricks a day

593
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
The designers of Sam

594
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
Semi-automated Mason

595
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,040
Playmates can do 3000

596
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,344
What's the brick itself

597
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,416
Various designs of interlocking brick

598
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,000
Much like Lego the catching on across the developing world

599
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,560
The result tends to be less strong

600
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:56,960

Radio Tempe

606
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:31,520
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

607
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:35,616
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a

608
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,664
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

609
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,736
We're looking the part might cost you your life

610
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:45,856
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

611
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:50,208
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

612
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:54,560
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

613
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:01,216
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff actually if I'm being honest

614
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,544
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing

615
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,944
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

616
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,272
Was found dead in my private gym

617
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,600
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

618
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,952
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

619
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,976
Now

620
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,280
I need to clear my name

621
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:31,680
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

622
