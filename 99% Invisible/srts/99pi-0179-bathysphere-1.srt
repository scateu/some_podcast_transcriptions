Every house is haunted

21
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,096
This is 99% invisible

22
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,080
The ocean is not our place

24
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,152
We can't breathe under there I can't really see

25
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,712
We can learn to swim but it doesn't come naturally

26
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,016
Hips don't swear

27
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,600
They want nothing to do with putting their bodies in the water

28
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
It's only humankind's incessant need to explore that drives us into such an unwelcoming invite

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,352
And since our bodies aren't built for it we must design thing

30
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,144
But allow us to explore this

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,912
Warren Place

32
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
And we have

33
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,752
That's our own Katie Mingle

34
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:52,896
Alexander the Great is said to have descended into the ocean more than 2000 years ago in a glass Barrel

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
There are various paintings

36
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
This event

37
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,344
In one the great is being lowered into the ocean by a couple of men in a wooden boat

38
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,904
He's hunched inside his little Barrel

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
Still wearing his

40
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
Crown and robe

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,560
The guys in the boat looked to me like they're used to humoring his every whim

42
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:16,704
In some versions of the story Alexander the Great was not in a barrel but in a diving bell

43
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,776
Diving Bells have been around for a long time

44
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,104
Aristotle wrote about them around 300 BC

45
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
And they were often actual Bells

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Like from churches

47
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,320
To understand how one uses such a thing to Aid in an ocean dive

48
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
Try this

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Quick experiment

50
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
Fill up your sink with water

51
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
And push a cup open and down

52
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
Into the water

53
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,096
You notice that the cop doesn't

54
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
Fill up all the way

55
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,192
There'll be a pocket of breathable air on the inside

56
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,312
Amazingly this works using giant church bells and the ocean to

57
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
Diver's Cove lower about

58
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,200
Into the ocean and use it as a kind of home base

59
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,040
Swimming out and around searching for Sunken Treasure

60
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
And then popping back into the Bell

61
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
First few guys

62
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,928
But it wasn't a good solution

63
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
The air didn't last long

64
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
The bells were cumbersome

65
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,560
And the divers still couldn't go down very far

66
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
Because of the pressure

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,728
The main obstacle to exploring the depths of the ocean has always been the pressure

68
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Bralette

69
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
200ft

70
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
Your lungs collapse and you die

71
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,200
That's Jim Gould telling it like it is

72
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
Professor biology

73
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,296
Princeton and he's married to Carol gold

74
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,368
Who will also be talking to you today I'm Carol Gould

75
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
I'm a science writer

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,256
Sheen Jimmy written 10 books together they've been married for 45 years

77
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,560
This is how Jim talks about the

78
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
The first time he met care

79
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
And

80
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
There she was

81
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
The person I've been looking for

82
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
All my life

83
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
I didn't take long from then

84
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,760
In the mid-1800s a naturalist named Edward Forbes

85
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,576
Hypothesize that below 300 fathoms

86
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
Or about 1800 ft

87
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
No life

88
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Exist

89
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
In the ocean

90
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
And people pretty much believed him

91
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,047
Well the general thought was that

92
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,839
It was just common sense

93
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,375
Nothing could live down there

94
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,191
Because the deeper you get

95
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
Pressure

96
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,983
Increases

97
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
On the living tissues

98
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,103
And it gets darker and darker

99
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,407
And it just made sense to people

100
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
You know the way we are so

101
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
Anthropocentric

102
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
If people can't live down there well

103
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,343
Probably nothing else

104
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,207
But these anthropocentric naysayers would soon be proven wrong

105
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,303
Continents were about to be strung together with Telegraph wires

106
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:56,191
Starting an 1858 nations were connected with extremely long wires

107
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:01,055
Messages would travel great distances through cables that lay on the ocean floor

108
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,919
And in 1860 as the Mediterranean cable was raised for repair

109
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
I'm about 6000 feet

110
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Lo and behold

111
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,551
Attached to the cable or Critters

112
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
Mostly dead Critters

113
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
The critters that were once

114
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Alive

115
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,975
This discovery was much talked about in the Press

116
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:24,095
There was a life in the depths of the ocean and everyone wanted to know more about it

117
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543
In 1872 the British royal Navy sent a modified warship called the HMS Challenger out on one of the

118
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
The first scientific expeditions

119
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:40,735
It was this big beautiful ship with sails it look like the kind of shape people hang paintings of and

120
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,271
Old rustic pubs

121
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,319
Or get tattooed on their bicep

122
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,671
The scientists and sailors spent 4 years on this ship

123
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,791
Studying the Earth's oceans trying especially understand the deepest

124
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
And they did things like put down Nets

125
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
Very deep into the water

126
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
And go along

127
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Hoping

128
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
But the Nets would catch something

129
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
It was down there

130
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,639
But just like our bodies can't survive the pressure at Great depths

131
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:13,247
Fish that live at the bottom of the ocean aren't made to live at the top

132
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
So as they come up

133
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,343
They they basically crystallizing fracture

134
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
So every cell

135
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
MicroCell explosion what you have is a bag of

136
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,839
Listening to some Sailors were pulling up giant Netflix

137
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
Bloated

138
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Fishkill

139
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
Still they managed to gather a bunch of specimen but they saved in jars full of pickling alcohol as they sale

140
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
Around the world

141
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,151
In the end they traveled almost 70000 nautical miles

142
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,455
Dredging in pickling

143
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
It was hard work

144
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
It was really an arduous

145
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
Trip because they started out with

146
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
How many sailors

147
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:54,207
Jump started with 214 and ended with 144

148
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:59,327
Two men went insane to drowned one committed suicide and several deserted

149
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:05,727
But the Challenger Expedition did catalog around 4000 new species and took depth measurement that hunger

150
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,567
Locations all over the ocean using a weighted string

151
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,967
On March 23rd 1875 at station number 225 located in the Southwest Pacific

152
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
Ocean between Guam and Palau

153
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,111
11 Caster weighted string over the side of the ship

154
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
And it just kept dropping

155
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
Dropping

156
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,511
Dropping

157
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
10000 feet

158
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
20000

159
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,631
30000

160
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:40,031
They had dropped their weight is the Mariana Trench and discovered what is still the deepest known place

161
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
On the ocean floor

162
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,175
But despite the challenges many accomplishments

163
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
Still no one had

164
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,015
Actually been very deep in the ocean

165
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,623
Been among the living creatures to see them alive in their natural habitat

166
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,951
There were various attempts of diving suits over the years

167
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
The picture the aesthetic range of the suits

168
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
Start with guy in a barrel with arm holes and get to Giant ridiculous Spaceman robot suit

169
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,287
You look back at these old suits if you seen the movie Forbidden Planet

170
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
You've seen

171
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,871
Asserts Robby the Robot looks exactly

172
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
Like one of these

173
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,967
What's the Michelin Man looks a lot like these suits

174
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,783
They were incredibly heavy and cumbersome

175
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
You couldn't swim in them

176
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,135
He had to get dried up to the surface by boat

177
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,231
And they all had tubes that stretched up to the surface for oxygen

178
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:37,631
Using one of these suits the Navy had said the man 563 feet under the surface of a freshwater lake

179
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,239
When do the submarines have been as deep as 383 ft in the ocean

180
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
Brands of the 1920s

181
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
No one had gone further than that

182
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
And then came a scientist

183
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
Named William Beebe

184
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
William Beebe was a respected ornithologist and an exceedingly Charming character who got around by bicycle

185
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,975
Spend his time gazing into the skies and writing about birds

186
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
Titles of his books include

187
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
The bird its form and function

188
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,935
Two bird lovers in Mexico and a monograph of pheasants

189
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
He really love birds

190
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
And then in the 1920s

191
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
Working near the coast

192
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
William Beebe turn his attention

193
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
To the ocean

194
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
He would

195
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
Look down in the water

196
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
And just

197
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,759
10 hours wondering what was down there

198
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
And

199
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,599
So then he started trying to think

200
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
And plan

201
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
Awake

202
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
Could get him down there

203
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:38,047
What is BB parted ways to go deep he couldn't seem to think outside the cylinder

204
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,863
Which was the shape of pre-existing submarines

205
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,191
Buy babies time of submarines could go down about

206
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
250

207
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
He went down further

208
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
Collapsed

209
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,823
Crush the pressure outside

210
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
I flattened everything inside

211
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
The result is you had a metal pan cake

212
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:02,111
And then in 1928 a young engineer named Otis Barton got in touch with baby and told him

213
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,415
Pedego is deep as he wanted to go

214
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,719
Cylinder was never going to work

215
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
The design had to be in the shape

216
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
Of a sphere

217
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
Even though

218
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
The ocean

219
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,935
Brings on more and more pressure

220
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
The deeper you go

221
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
That pressure

222
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
If you're innosphere

223
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,359
Is present equally on every

224
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
Square inch of the spear

225
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:30,271
Who does Martin told BBC help him design and engineer this new submersible

226
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,855
As long as he was allowed to accompany Bebe on all of the trip

227
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,903
The sphere made into the sea

228
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,303
Which was a pretty crazy thing for Barton to want considering what eight tiny uncomfortable submersible he

229
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
He was about to make

230
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
The final design was about

231
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
4 1/2 ft in diameter

232
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:51,263
And there wasn't a bench or even a level floor inside the bathroom

233
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
I sat on this horrible cold

234
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Wet concave

235
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Floor

236
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,919
The kind of pushed back together

237
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
And they weren't really great friends

238
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,503
Either

239
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,087
The sphere was made of steel and had two windows

240
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
Fix you

241
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Quartz

242
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
Provided

243
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,951
Extremely Clear View into the water

244
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
It also had a small hat

245
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
Enter through

246
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
They called it

247
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
The baathist

248
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
Bath is being the Greek word

249
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
Pradeep

250
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:25,055
William Beebe set up a science station on nonsuch island in Bermuda and they began doing Dives in the bathysphere

251
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:31,711
The submersible couldn't move on its own so I had to be lowered on a cable off of a boat and then plant drive to

252
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,039
In retrospect the whole thing seems

253
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,855
Extremely low Tech well it was 1930

254
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,183
And their high-tech is now our very very low-tech

255
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:47,839
Inside the sphere were some canisters of oxygen and some trays of chemicals that's soaked up the CO2 they were

256
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Breathing out

257
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,167
It was cramped and humid in there

258
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,543
Condensation pooled on the floor and Otis Barton was often seasick

259
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,639
They circulated the air with

260
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,967
Onlyfans

261
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
Back and forth

262
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,807
And that was the height of comfort

263
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,111
They were literally just Fanning themselves

264
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Yep

265
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:17,535
It wasn't comfortable but the sphere did completely Shield them from the outside pressure

266
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:23,935
They didn't have to worry about the bends or decompression sickness that divers can experience when it's ending too quickly

267
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,775
The thing that really scared them with the idea of a leek

268
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
Because if there were even a pinhole

269
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
Leak

270
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
A toastie

271
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Pressures

272
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,687
A jet of water would come in

273
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
At such a high rate of

274
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
Pressure speed

275
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
That it would just be like being shot

276
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,159
The bullet if the two men can make it safely into the ocean's depths

277
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,255
They would be able to see out into the dark ocean using a spotlight

278
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:54,143
The Vessel also have a telephone they could use to talk to the people in the boat above them

279
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,495
Their first dive on May 27th 1930 was just 45 ft down

280
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,103
But overtime Bebe & Barton started doing deeper and deeper Dives in the bathroom

281
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
When they steal them in it was in

282
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
Ratably noisy

283
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,735
Because I have to hammer those

284
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,807
Big steel bolt in and

285
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
That just drove me crazy

286
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:20,255
Then you went to the surface and it was flashing around and then it just got very

287
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
Jerry

288
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Quiet

289
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
And you hear the sound of

290
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
The oxygen

291
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
Coming in may be very quiet

292
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Bush

293
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:36,639
And then you do the voice of Gloria who was on the other end of the telephone talking to BV

294
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,527
Glorietta bathysphere 285 ft

295
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,927
The Lusitania is resting at this level

296
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,255
Deepest point

297
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,815
You're now at 600 feet

298
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,727
1426 ft

299
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,519
We are still alive

300
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
And 1/4 of a mile down

301
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
As they descended deeper baby became obsessed with the changing light and color inside the bath

302
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
The sphere in his Memoir a half-mile down he dedicates Pages upon pages to this

303
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
Subject

304
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
The blueness of the blue

305
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,535
Outside and inside of sphere

306
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,351
Cheetah mask material

307
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
Definable

308
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,287
Translucent blue quite unlike anything I've ever seen in the world

309
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:43,967
As the bathysphere sunk lower and lower

310
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,783
They would have been floating in complete darkness

311
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,439
The BB & Barton both swore there was somehow still an aura of blueness to the blackness

312
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:59,071
It's as if the blue had seeped so thoroughly into their eyeballs that they still saw it

313
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Even in the dark

314
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
And

315
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
Baby comments on this and many people

316
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Spend down

317
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
Comment on this

318
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,847
When he wasn't having his mind blown by the varying shades of blue

319
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,663
BB was tripping out on the fish

320
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
After the sunlight disappeared

321
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:20,575
The only fish they be able to see without their Spotlight with the ones that provided their own light

322
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
What is

323
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,647
Fish with bioluminescence

324
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,999
So they spent a lot of time turning the spotlight on and off

325
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
Poseidus pentagramas

326
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
The five line constellations

327
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
Fish almost round

328
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
Longmont

329
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
The ocean was

330
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,639
Steaming with strange looking creatures

331
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Call Dad

332
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:51,807
Evie would describe these creatures in great detail over the telephone line that went up to the boat above

333
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,623
On the sides of the body where five unbelievable

334
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
Equatorial

335
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
With two curved ones above

336
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
And then Elsa Boston

337
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
It was an amazing artist

338
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,191
With their onboard as well and she would make sketches

339
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
Island

340
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:14,079
Baby finally came up he would look them over and say yes that's right no that's wrong

341
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
Straighten it all out

342
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,919
Everyone was surrounded by a semicircle

343
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
A very small but intensely purple photophores bosselman sketches were published in National Geographic

344
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:30,975
My back and the creatures they portrayed were so strange so otherworldly that readers couldn't believe

345
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
If they were real

346
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,071
A lot of people actually accuse BB of making stuff up

347
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
And that hurt baby

348
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
4bb

349
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
Almost everything

350
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:44,799
But he described that so many people thought could not possibly exist

351
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,847
Has since been

352
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Discovered

353
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
Only two or three

354
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
Still haven't been found

355
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:58,367
Over the course of four years Bebe & Barton made dozens of Dives and catalogs several new species of

356
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,951
They made it to 3028 ft deep

357
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,279
6 times deeper than anyone has ever been

358
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:11,167
On one of his final Dives in the bathysphere William Beebe saw something he'd never seen before

359
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
4

360
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,751
He saw this enormous

361
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Sea snake

362
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,823
On the bottom of the ocean

363
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
It was long and black

364
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,151
The longest teacher he

365
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Ever seen

366
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
Hand tractor

For a while before he realized it was the Atlantic Cable

368
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:33,695
It was one of the transatlantic Telegraph wires that I got in the whole world interested

And understanding the bottom of the ocean

370

00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,719
Or turn it around at will

381
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,327
