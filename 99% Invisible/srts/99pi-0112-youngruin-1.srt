I'm Roman Mars

36
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
He wondered at Machu Picchu or Stonehenge or the Colosseum or even snuck into that abandoned house on the edge of town

37
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,840
Sound you know the power in a piece of decrepit architecture

38
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,424
Even if you haven't been to these places

39
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,728
They've been photographed in film for you

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,776
Abandoned Soviet bus stops

41
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
Deserted old movie theaters

42
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,104
Ducane residential street

43
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
They're fascinating in this life

44
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
Planet of the Apes

45
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
So of course

46
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
There's a German word for it

47
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
Ruin and Lewis

48
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,904
The long-standing aesthetic obsession with decay

49
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,488
Resident germanophile and producer Avery trufelman

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,304
It might actually be one of those made up German words

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
It probably is

52
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,424
For the concept itself is totally a real thing

53
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,216
Ruins Inspire Wonder

54
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:22,080
They give the mines this task of reconciling what's there and what's not

55
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
What once was

56
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
And what now is

57
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,992
People flock to remainders of ancient civilizations

58
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,552
Romans the Mayans the Egyptians

59
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,648
But people also flock to things that just look like they're ancient to

60
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:41,280
That combination of decomposition and romance makes a perfect cocktail of repulsion and Allure

61
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,840
And for San franciscans this place

62
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
Is Sutro Baths

63
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
My friend Austin brought me there one night

64
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:54,080
How do you get into the trail just bleed right to it

65
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
Head to the rocks at Land's End

66
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,176
I'm a very northwest corner of San Francisco

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Walk down the flight of stairs

68
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
Into a grassy slope

69
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
That hugs the sea

70
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,856
Off to the right is the gaping maw of

71
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
The cave

72
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
To your left

73
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
Is the crumbled Foundation

74
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
Have a concrete structure

75
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
It looks like a giant Belgian waffle

76
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
About 7 feet tall and 50

77
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
2 feet wide

78
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
On the longest side

79
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Beside the waffle

80
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,680
R2 pools

81
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,448
Stillwater

82
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
For the concrete jetty

83
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,264
Between them that dares you to walk in

84
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
Make it to the end

85
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,152
And you are at a seawall for the Pacific Ocean crashes into the Rock

86
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
There's no fan

87
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
No guard

88
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
Only a warning sign

89
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
That says

90
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Danger

91
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
Cliffs at Surf area X

92
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
Extremely dangerous

93
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
People have been swept from a rock

94
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:46,304
Ground where you can sit down here are the ruins of the bathhouse

95
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,888
Have you heard any rumors as to what was what year

96
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:55,520
Strangely no I mean other than a bath house in San Francisco

97
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,920
But all that might indicate San Francisco bath house

98
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
If you thinking of what I think

99
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
He's thinking of

100
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
But we'll get back to that in a minute

101
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
At last time you were here is like

102
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,672
People wondering about the history of it at all

103
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,744
No it's like three hundred bucks in a cave

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,047
Austin and seen a band playing in the cave

105
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
The plug their amps into a generator that they brought themselves

106
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
He told me things like that were happening at Sutro Baths

107
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
All the time

108
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
And it's easy to see why

109
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,287
This place has a draw

110
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
Like that I was there

111
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
The group of photographers with snapping shots of the Moon

112
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:38,527
This is like a known photo definition

113
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,343
3 years have been more common so I think people finding out about it

114
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
I just know they're going to like 2:30 is it was some sort of bad for people to sit in and just soak

115
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,559
I don't know Who's hotter colder

116
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:57,471
Ruins of drawing people to them for centuries

117
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,871
End of memes to go visit sites of antiquity Paris Venice Rome and learn about the roots of Western Civilization

118
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,175
Did a lot of people visit what's left

119
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Of the old world

120
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
People like ruins

121
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,319
It gives us a sense of time passing

122
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
Baby sense of place

123
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,671
Why do people go to ancient Egypt why to go to the Acropolis

124
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
Sense of time gone by

125
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
A sense of timelessness

126
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
And I think also like that

127
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
Try to explain but

128
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
What people are looking at

129
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
Anytime you got to

130
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Crawling all over the room

131
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
But the thing about these ruins

132
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
At the edge of the continent

133
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
They may look ancient

134
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
But they really aren't

135
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
At all

136
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Utah

137
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,735
I'll try to figure the place out

138
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
These tunnels doing

139
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,599
This thing is it curiosity to it they know their ruins

140
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
Nathan fake if anything

141
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Future Bass

142
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
And that's about it

143
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
This is historian John martini

144
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,047
Martini wrote a book about this place

145
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
Cold sutro's glass Palace

146
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
So named because this pool of water

147
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,727
Used to be underneath an enormous

148
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Flask

149
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
Structure

150
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,079
It was the pet project about off Sutra

151
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,687
The name Sutro might sound familiar to you especially if you live in San Francisco

152
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,063
There's Sutro Tower Sutro Heights there's a Sutro library at the San Francisco State University

153
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,623
All named after this one German immigrants

154
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,487
He struck it rich by engineering tunnel during the Nevada Silver Strike

155
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,071
And he turned his money into San Francisco real estate

156
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
A lot of Real Estate

157
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:33,215
Some historians estimate that one point out of Sutro owned 1/12 of the city

158
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,335
Adolph Sutro was to San Francisco with John D Rockefeller was to New York

159
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,383
And what Henry Huntington was to LA

160
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,455
Do travel Public Gardens presented free concerts

161
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,783
And build a structure that would eventually become Sutro Baths

162
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
Sutras original idea

163
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,647
Was that he wanted to build a giant outdoor Aquarium

164
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,559
That would be filled by the tides and it would empty it low tide so in 1884 he created a catch Basin that refill

165
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
Build naturally as the waves broken

166
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,191
And then Sutro kept making more and more plan

167
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,263
Adding on an aquarium

168
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Built

169
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,079
The network of swimming pools

170
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:16,735
Connecting canals Even build up our house is a freestanding building to keep the water then when all that was done Vinnie Hunters Market

171
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
Assembly would be like if

172
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,135
Some crazy self-improvement guy built the foundation for an elaborate house

173
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,231
But didn't know what house was going to look like he just built foundation and he plumbed it

174
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
And then you hire an arch

175
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,071
Give me to make a building sit on top of what was already there

176
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
Toilet bathroom design

177
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
From the outside

178
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
Sutro Baths look like an ornate

179
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
Palatial Greenhouse

180
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
Underneath its Majestic

181
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,823
Three tiered glass canopy

182
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
For several different swimming

183
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
Hot water and cold

184
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Saltwater and fresh

185
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,991
And there were more than 500

186
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,575
Individual changing rooms beneath the sweeping arena-style bleach

187
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
And attached to the bath

188
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Was a museum

189
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,231
Full of sutras crazy collection of

190
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,767
Stuff from around the world

191
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
Miniature boats

192
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
Model building

193
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
Taxidermied animals

194
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Gems

195
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
Mechanical figures

196
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
A real Egyptian mummy

197
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,311
All inside of a glass Palace facing the ocean at the edge of San Francisco

198
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Up the hill

199
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,919
When's the road was a street called Merry way

200
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
There was a first wheel

201
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
Basically a ferris wheel

202
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,319
Along with a roller coaster and a Hall of Mirrors

203
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
And games of chance

204
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,951
And keep in mind Sutro with a building at the edge of nowhere

205
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,743
On the rocks by the sea

206
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:37,375
And public transit didn't go there and this was a challenge for both construction workers and for customers

207
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,679
The lost money from the day it opened

208
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
It was huge white

209
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,007
Medcost Adolph Sutro

210
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
About a million dollars

211
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
When it opened in 1890

212
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
4

213
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
And you've you put that today that's

214
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
3740 million dollars

215
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,783
It could make money from the church

216
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,135
People are $0.10 to get in and $0.15 to go swing it would have had to be packed

217
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
Almost everyday

218
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,975
And in an attempt to pack the house

219
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,839
Sutro poured even more money into electric Rail lines that let out to the bat

220
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:13,983
This was a huge Boon for the city's mass transit at the same time he owned all the land

221
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,287
Surrounding at the people going to be traveling through

222
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,687
And there were always advertisements for did the sutralam company were they trying to sell and so he's doing things for the public

223
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,991
At the same trying trying to make some money

224
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
But Sutro Baths

225
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
Just

226
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Never

227
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Ever

228
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Made money

229
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,023
By the time out of suture was elected mayor in 1890 for his beloved bass we're still not turning a profit

230
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:42,399
When he died four years later in 1898 his family started looking to get rid of a property

231
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:46,495
The Sutro family tried for years to sell Sutro Baths

232
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,335
Well also trying valiantly to make it turn a profit

233
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:56,735
In 1934 my father was hired by Adolph Sutro who is the grandson of the pioneer eight

234
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Adolph Sutro

235
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,831
Just about that time at all suture wanted to do something to

236
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
Get more people out here

237
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:08,767
If you go to Sutro Baths you may run into Tom Bratton

238
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
Parks in the come out here

239
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,375
Once a week in for a few hours in the talk to people in

240
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,447
Let him know just exactly what are these ruins were it out

241
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,103
Tom's father was an engineer and he helped Sutro Baths undergo it's really Wiggy midlife

242
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
Crisis cut off the bottom

243
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
Cool cut that off

244
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
From the regular pool

245
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,039
Drain that scatter sand around on it put in some

246
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Tables

247
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
Ping pong tables in

248
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
Picnic tables

249
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
And they called that the traffic be

250
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,303
The Tropic Beach was supposed to be a warm Sandy place in Doris's to hang out

251
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
Even though the real Bates

252
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Right outside

253
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
That it really didn't work out too well

254
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,239
Which it really is a shame because right outside the beach is

255
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,079
Freezing and usually foggy eye drop conversion isn't that crazy

256
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
And so they said well

257
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
How about this

258
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,967
Take that traffic Beach away

259
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
And we'll put a platform there

260
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,599
And we'll make that into an ice rink

261
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:10,719
And when Tom was in high school his father got him a job working at this very ice rink

262
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,071
Yes Tom work at this place while it was still standing which seems impossible

263
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
Given the how ancient the ruins look

264
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,167
People will really come up to me and say

265
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,007
Were these really ruins from Rome

266
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,079
Not really not at all

267
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
Tom just being nice

268
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,943
By the time Tom was employed there the name of the place had changed

269
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
From Sutro Baths

270
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
Suggest Sutro

271
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,879
Bozzuto family had finally gotten rid of this place in 1952 when entertainment Tycoon

272
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:43,743
George Whitney bought it Whitney was the boss when Tom braaten started as a locker attendant

273
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
And even more than the Sutro family

274
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,167
George Whitney was really trying to do everything he could to get people to come out

275
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
So we tacked on more amusements including a ride

276
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,567
High above the sea that shuttle between the two cliffs

277
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,359
On either side of sutro's

278
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
He called it

279
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
The sky tram

280
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
The sky tram

281
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
This thing that hold about 20 people

282
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
It took about 20 minutes to get across

283
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
Took didn't eliminate make a lot of money on it

284
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,183
Whitney also thought an Aviary might bring in the big money

285
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
So he ordered some exotic birds

286
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Phantom cages

287
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,327
What happened was all the birds came in at once

288
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
Before the cages

289
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,959
So they had that we need to go out to all the employees and said okay

290
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
Everybody here

291
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
Take it home take home a bird

292
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,151
Until Dark Ages come in and then we'll bring the birds back

293
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
But even after the ice ring

294
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Mava

295
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
And the sky tram

296
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
People still weren't coming to sutro's

297
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
The whitneys

298
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,207
After struggling for 14 years

299
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,791
Decided we're going to sell the property historian John Martini again

300
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
It was sold to a land developer

301
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
Who began to

302
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Demolish it

303
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Amanda

304
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,727
Engine 66 that's when the very convenient fire broke out

305
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:04,383
In 1966 a mysterious fire broke out to a pile of rubble an arsonist was suspected

306
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
But no one was arrested

307
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
And then sutro's

308
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
Never rebuilt

309
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:15,391
Eventually the last owner sold the land for National Park Service in 1980 so it's part of a

310
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
National Park area

311
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:23,071
Sutro Baths is right inside Golden Gate National Recreation Area

312
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,631
Included into this big National Park area

313
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
It's not a national park

314
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:32,287
And it doesn't look like it belongs within the Golden Gate national parks Conservancy at all

315
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
It just looks like a bunch of ruin

316
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
Sometimes ruins are more evocative than its

317
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
The site is restored

318
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,527
Cuz this is the real deal even though these are only 45 years old

319
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
They have the same attraction

320
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
The Purge try to explain

321
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
But

322
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
What people are looking at

323
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,071
So unlike other ruins remains of Sutro Baths for less than 50 years old

324
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,607
They're part of the National Park

325
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:01,215
Since 2012 they do have their own tiny Museum and Gift Shop on side

326
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
Ride along the Midway used to be

327
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
The street sign is still there

328
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,151
The roads are still pretty dangerous and too many people

329
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
Still mysterious

330
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,783
So this point you may be wondering how to get out to the bath

331
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,087
Or about parking availability

332
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,671
Or maybe if you can go hold your photoshoot there

333
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
Joe can help

334
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,255
People write me with

335
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,863
Can I have my wedding there how can I get there can I fill my movie there

336
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
I answer all their questions

337
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:37,311
New Corral run Sutro Baths. Com random chicken Seattle from Seattle

338
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,359
You know I just respond to their question

339
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,199
Like yes is your wedding party smaller than 30 people sure you can have it there

340
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:48,319
Jill snag Sutro Baths, 2000

341
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,463
When it was Sutro Baths on Facebook or Twitter those accounts are also run by gel

342
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,815
In Seattle people ask me like how much does it cost can I get in

343
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
It's just like

344
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Just go

345
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
It's never close

346
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
And unlike

347
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,751
Tom braaten or John Martini who actually both experience

348
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
Sutro Baths when it was a functioning building

349
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,127
Jill first encounter the place as a ruin

350
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Phone out to San Fran

351
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,967
Just go for a job interview 1997

352
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
My main mission was to touch

353
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
Pacific Ocean that Davis

354
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
For my interview

355
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
I went down there and I stumbled

356
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
On this

357
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Just

358
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
Insane

359
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Playground

360
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
Concrete metal

361
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,351
Sticking out of the ground I don't know what the hell it was it was just

362
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Pretty much

363
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,935
The closest to a magical place I found as an adult

364
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
And if I fell in love

365
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
I think I will

366
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
Toss my assets after I die

367
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,199
Jill actually did bury her to pet lizards there

368
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
They're in the cave

369
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,415
The story of Sutro Baths didn't exactly shape history

370
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
Does it help expand Sanford

371
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Transit

372
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
Yes you can see the ruins

373
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,815
Briefly in a scene in the movie Harold and Maude

374
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:07,935
But ultimately it was a strange glass complex at the edge of the ocean that was destined to fail

375
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
And Amusements

376
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Attractions

377
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,055
Constantly added and removed throughout its life

378
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,383
But in a city as rapidly gentrifying is San Francisco

379
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,687
In a country as young as the United

380
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
States

381
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
These ruins

382
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
Are an anomaly

383
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
I respect people's desire

384
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
For it to be like this

385
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,623
Mysterious unknown thing

386
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
But

387
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Whack your

388
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,743
Twist talking into sitting there wondering like I

389
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
I have been known to walk out today

390
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,327
And tell them like they're used

391
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
To be there

392
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
Giant

393
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
Before magical thing here

394
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Know about it

395
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
Always read the plaque right

396
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
You got it

397
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,847
In addition to researching what the battles were

398
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
Joe keeps tabs on how they're changing

399
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
Ruins seen status

400
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
What affects the ending

401
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
But of course they're not

402
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,575
I have watched it continue to fall apart

403
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
There used to be a deck

404
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,183
That you could go and Redan by the cave and then it just

405
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Crumbled into the sea

406
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
Sometime around

407
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
2005

408
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Still

409
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Living in

410
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Dying

411
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
In slow-mo

412
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,751
Which is a process the parks are actually trying to stop

413
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
According to Tom Brown

414
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,591
As far as the national parks

415
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,663
So that is not going to deteriorate anymore that already has

416
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,503
If it deteriorates anymore you're not going to really be able to tell what a really what has

417
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:31,647
Tom speculates they might do this by adding more signed by destabilizing some of the decaying structures but not

418
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Too much more

419
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
Both parks

420
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,487
Really don't want to do it

421
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,535
They don't want to make it look like a box

422
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,863
Can I go inside and look at the ruins and it comes out again

423
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,959
But recently the young ruins have become something else entirely

424
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,007
Nature's reclaiming the site

425
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
The ruins

426
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
Continue to evolve

427
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,103
The old swimming pools themselves

428
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,407
Have become partly silted in

429
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
It's become a wetland

430
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
Migrating birds website

431
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,295
And recently an otter appeared

432
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
Swimming in Sutro Baths

433
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,879
The public dubbed him Sutro Sam

434
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,207
Sutro Baths continues to be a machine

435
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,255
Regenerating new San Francisco Folk

436
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
Today Sutro Baths

437
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,351
Is pretty much back to where it started

438
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,399
All That Remains is the foundation

439
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
Including the original catch basin

440
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
Adolph Sutro built

441
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,775
Before ever imagining

442
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
A swimming pool

443
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
Tropic Beach

444
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
A carnival Midway

445
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
An ice skating rink

446
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:31,807
So after all the years of building the Palace of Wonder after adding games and rides and Oddities

447
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,415
Trying and failing to draw the public out to this strange place by the ocean

448
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,279
All out of Sutro or George Whitney had to do was let it burn down

449
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
In crumble

450
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Into ruin

455
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,487
They could have even work without on Sutro

456
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Between the beats

457

The cluttered World a man-made sound

460
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751

I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of

539
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,480
A few days ago Wesley Stern
