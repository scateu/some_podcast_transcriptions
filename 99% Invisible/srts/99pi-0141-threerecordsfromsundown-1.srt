This is 99% invisible

17
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm Roman Mars

18
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:14,496
There is one word us radio producers can never seem to let go of

19
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,032
Tape

20
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,848
Our job used to be all about tape

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,432
My first Marantz recorder captured sound on cassette tapes

22
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
If you're a little bit older than me and you even produce your stories on tape you'd sit in front of a reel-to-reel and cut apart someone

23
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,624
Boys with a razor blade

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,976
And then splice the Magnetic Tape back together with clear adhesive tape

25
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:40,352
These days we use digital recorders in computer is but we still use the word tape

26
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,752
Did you get good tape

27
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:53,152
The raw material that we work with is tape it just is there is no alternative

28
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:57,504
Are tattoos also inextricably linked to tape cassette tapes in this case

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,904
Had it not been for obsessive fans collecting and copying and passing along his songs in the era of tapes we

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
We might never have come to know his music

31
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,512
Finnegan had he lived in a different era

32
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,608
Perhaps he would have gotten the recognition he deserved within his own lifetime

33
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,936
From Radio producer Charles Maines

34
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
Misses three records from Sundown

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
You know one of the things that

36
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,648
I've said a lot but I'm not sure how much people understand it

37
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416
Really

38
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't like singer-songwriters

39
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,072
It's not what I choose to listen to

40
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,864
Stop my first option

41
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:52,032
You know I grew up listening to Roots Music or to Jazz or to you no music

42
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
Bye

43
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,712
Exaggerated

44
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504
Yeah music by real people

45
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
By people from the Earth

46
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
People who

47
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
You're not middle class

48
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
You know

49
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
And

50
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,816
I don't I know I don't think in history you look back I don't think there's that many examples of the middle class

51
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
Inventing anything

52
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
You know culturally

53
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
So

54
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,776
When I put on the tape

55
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
And I hear

56
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
You know

57
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
Well-educated White

58
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Person

59
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
Strumming a guitar

60
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:38,880
Yeah I am looking at my watch and I'm saying okay I'll give this another 15 seconds

61
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,928
Unless the voice is

62
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
Really star

63
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
And

64
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,304
Nick Dre just

65
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
Grab me by the throat

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,544
It's one of the great sadness and frustration Supply

67
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:01,920
Life in the music business that I wasn't able to figure out a way to get it across to people

68
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
In his lifetime

69
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
Three records from

70
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,375
Producer Joe Boyd remembers Nick Drake

71
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
The early days

72
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
1966

73
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
Joe Boyd

74
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
Young American

75
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,279
Drive to London hoping to make his Mark in the thriving music scene

76
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
This is the first Pink Floyd single

77
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,959
Any discoverist English folk rock Pioneers the Fairport convention

78
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:02,591
Arguably he makes his greatest find far from the Streets of London

79
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
Cambridge

80
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
Electronic drink

81
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,879
The English have such funny names for class I would call him an upper-middle-class boy

82
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
You know

83
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,743
The upper middle class always call themselves middle class

84
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
But you know

85
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,095
The lower-middle-class also call themselves middle class

86
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
Anyway he was definitely

87
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,215
Went to a boarding school and spoke with a very refined accent

88
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
He was

89
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Part of a kind of

90
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Gilded youth

91
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
Generation

92
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Well off

93
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Upper

94
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
Middle-class kids

95
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,855
The way the truth and you know he was

96
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
Very talented in music

97
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
He

98
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,767
Started playing the clarinet to switch the guitar his mother

99
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,351
Play the piano and wrote songs

100
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,935
And years later I discovered I heard tapes of his mother

101
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
And they're amazing

102
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
You know they have these wonderful

103
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
Chords on the piano

104
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,687
Any of the start of the song It's a bit

105
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,039
Very English free almost Music Hall

106
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:20,671
Upper class Music Hall Flanders and Swann Noel coward's kind of thing

107
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
End

108
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,911
He started playing guitar and he's just he was just I don't know where it came from but he

109
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,055
Beltway of reproducing the guitar the kind of cords that is Mother played on piano

110
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:57,279
I heard him first because one of the Fairport convention

111
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,631
Told me about hearing him at concert

112
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,239
The Roundhouse it was a Vietnam protest concert

113
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
And

114
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
Follow up the lead

115
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
Invited to come in and bring me a tape

116
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
He brought me a tape

117
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:28,255
And put it on

118
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:34,655
Immediately knew that this was something completely different a lot of retuning

119
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,007
String to the PE played in very unusual boy names

120
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:45,407
And his ejaculation of arpeggios on the guitar and the whole way he use

121
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:51,807
Guitar to underpin his songs is completely unique in my view men's suits

122
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:58,207
So strong and so Central and so devoid of solos and there's nothing about

123
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,607
Guitar solos in there it's just a way of orchestrating a song in a complexity that

124
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:11,007
Staggering

125
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,807
Openstack

126
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
I'm down to the

127
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:43,007
In search of America

128
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,607
40-minute designs neck trick to deal with his witch seasoning

129
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
Island records

130
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
Beers 1968

131
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
Drake is 20 years old

132
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:28,319
New Talent is beyond reticent

133
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,719
I would get used to make drinks way of answering the telephone

134
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
He was so shy as a performer

135
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
When the circumstances

136
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Right

137
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,039
And the only certainty that I remember most clearly as being right was

138
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:06,463
Unscramble convention play the Festival Hall and his ride your Matic because they had a car accident the drummer been killed

139
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
Configuration of the group

140
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,607
So everybody was in their seats and respectful

141
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
Nick came out

142
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
Didn't say anything

143
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
Play the song to get Florida

144
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,335
3 minutes without speaking

145
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
Returnees guitar

146
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
Everybody stayed silent

147
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,295
Play It Again already gave a big ovation

148
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
Got an encore at the end

149
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
And I thought

150
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
He's going to work

151
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
Can you send him out on his own

152
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:47,935
You know Anna is a student union for kids bar the back

153
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:54,591
Doesn't say anything no jokes has no chance

154
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,991
Take me to Guitar Picks fights on time and he just has little intern

155
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:07,391
Between songs he lost everybody

156
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
And

157
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
Already stopped performing live

158
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,311
And there was no other way in England those days you really break an artist

159
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
The middle Zedd

160
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:31,711
Is Drake's career with Central recording studio

161
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:37,855
Boyd recruits engineer John would it sound technique studio in London for Drake's debut album

162
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
The record is called

163
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
Five leaves left

164
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
Beers 1969

165
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
Difficult to remember

166
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,215
There wasn't really a template for doing this kind of record

167
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,567
Record a singer with strings or with

168
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,895
Larger orchestral arrangement

169
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
But not in a pump way

170
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,039
It was a kind of dry Ash intimate

171
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Sound on The Voice and

172
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
And doing it so tasteful way

173
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,207
Would not tell me they've been done much

174
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
And

175
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,375
We already tried one arranger the guy who worked on the James Taylor record

176
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
Retention record

177
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
And just

178
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
8042

179
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
Just didn't work at all

180
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
And

181
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,407
And Nixon said well I have this friend in Cambridge

182
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Robert Kirby

183
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,087
And I went up to Cambridge to meet Kirby you know and I was a bit freaked out because I thought Nick is world-class

184
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
So we want the best

185
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,999
You want world is top Ranger London whoever it is will spend the money will get the guy

186
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
And Nicholson will actually

187
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Let's try my friend in Cambridge

188
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
It's 19 years old

189
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,495
And I think oh no no no I don't

190
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,943
But I would have met him and I just like the way they were together in the way my life Roberts and he seemed to

191
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
Really really love Nick and his music

192
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,551
I just felt okay let's just go with this

193
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,439
And so we did this procession in the first track they did was way too blue which I had never heard because you didn't

194
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
A way to play it to me

195
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
And

196
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,119
I suppose I could have gone down into the room

197
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
And just listen but I tended to

198
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:34,591
You know that John would be the guy running around moving microphones and messing around in the studio and I sat in the control room

199
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,199
Besides it was a climb you know the scrotum is upstairs

200
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:44,831
Anyway, we down all it back up again so I was just sitting up there reading my paper and listening to

201
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,207
There were strings rehearse and you'd hear them John would focus on

202
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,863
One microphone another microphone and another microphone try to get that thing go downstairs move the microphone will the

203
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,263
Chairs around active hearing these bits and pieces of this thing and send it to me

204
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,359
I couldn't figure out what it really did sound like

205
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:14,527
And then finally got everybody in position and John got his sound he water and every microphone every

206
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,599
Part of the six piece string string ensemble

207
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
And

208
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,463
And then he just pushed all the fighters

209
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
We listen to this whole thing

210
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:33,215
And I just oh my God

211
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,615
Don't you have a while to show

212
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:52,415
A way to find somebody tell me

213
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:58,815
Xiaomi

214
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:05,215
What you have to show

215
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,615
Cucumin

216
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:22,879
Have you seen the light I thought mommy made the record oh my God the critics going to love this is so awesome but we're

217
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,183
We're going to get headlines

218
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
Melody Maker said

219
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,607
It was an awkward mixture of folk and cocktail jazz

220
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
So

221
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
I don't know

222
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
It seems very sad

223
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
What you

224
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
Discouraged

225
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
Distraught

226
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,743
Strike back into the studio

227
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,047
What produces second record

228
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
Beers 1970

229
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
One of these events

230
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
When approached

231
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
Nick a lot

232
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
The first

233
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
Leonard Cohen album

234
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,015
Which I thought John Simon did a great job of producing

235
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
And

236
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,903
One of the songs I love it was so long Marianne

237
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:05,023
He has these girls mocking his line

238
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,095
Hircine behind him against him

239
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
Any kind of

240
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:15,007
Contrast in the air brassiness to his delicacy

241
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:32,927
And when he played me

242
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,487
Korbel originally when he played it to me

243
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,583
That Chorus Line old pool boy so sorry for himself

244
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,655
He sang

245
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:49,055
And I said I just had this idea right away I said Nick let's

246
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:55,455
Get some girl singer to sing that long when you answer at the end of them

247
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,855
He kind of looked at me funny like you sure

248
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:08,255
I said yes I'm sure okay

249
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,647
John Wooden I learned recording Nick very quickly that you just turn Nick off

250
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
In the markets

251
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,023
His next performance is always

252
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Great

253
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,911
You know you when we would record Nick with

254
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,007
Strings or Rhythm Section or or whatever

255
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
Even if it was out of the room and when he recorded with strings he recorded in the room and it's different from the way people do things today

256
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:05,599
Trackside River man that's not an overdub string section and that's Nick singing and playing

257
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:11,999
Guitar in the room in the middle of the strings

258
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
Going to see the resume so you're listening very carefully to

259
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:31,199
Everybody else and you go for their performance

260
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,599
Get a gray tank from strings or the brass the Rhythm Section or whoever the

261
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,999
The weakest link is you don't even have to listen to me then you listen

262
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:50,399
Always

263
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,799
Guitar parts he never flubbed it just never did

264
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,671
Despite critical Acclaim brighter later sells poorly

265
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,463
London Tube

266
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,511
Parents

267
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,815
Behavior is increasingly erratic

268
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,167
At his family's urgent track seek psychiatric care

269
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,591
Around the same time California

00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,639
Jobs in the film industry

271
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
What kind of reputation

272
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Very solitary loan

273
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
Person you knew

274
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,744
Yeah I mean he was soft-spoken

275
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
Hesitant

276
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
But he was he nobody liked it

277
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
Behemoth

278
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Very good idea

279
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
Can he work break laws

280
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Robert Kirby

281
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,336
Incredible fun

282
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
Work in the city with me just because

283
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
Material you're working

284
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,224
And the fact that it's not

285
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Self can

286
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Group

287
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
You got to go out

288
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Records

289
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:55,840
The end days

290
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:02,240
Directions to third and final album pink moon

1974 Drake is found dead in his bedroom

294
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:53,440
26 years old

295
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:59,840
Nobody knows

296
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,624
The story

297
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,304
Boyd eventually sells his label steak in Island records

298
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,936
One of his parting conditions is a Drake's recordings never go out of print never

299
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
Second detail

300
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,592
Falcons draft picks recordings begin to find an audience

301
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,688
Fans make pilgrimages to the Drake family home in Tamworth in Arden

302
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,504
Text parents Rodney and Molly

303
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,296
The interest in our sun

304
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,672
Invitees visitors in the copy cassettes and home recordings of Drake's music

305
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,000
Overtime the Drake Legend spreads

306
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,072
Combination of word-of-mouth and

307
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,888
Tape to tape

308
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,312
To take to take the tape

309
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,040
Is it surprising to you how

310
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:01,440
Popular Netflix music has become kind of after his death and Call it spring

311
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,424
No I mean I always thought he should be that popular and my video is what took him ready

312
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
So long

313
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,288
The shame that people didn't recognize it in his lifetime

314
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,152
But you know there it is to music there

315
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,864
Are you know I don't know how to deal with questions like what was his ahead-of-its-time so

316
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
I think so is very much

317
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:47,264
You know what happened in that time and then set of influences that

318
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
You know

319
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,336
But I do think that

320
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,688
In a way it's failure at the time has been

321
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,528
Heart of its success now in the sense that

322
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,880
Very few people growing old growing up in the 80s

323
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,208
They didn't have parents who were playing Nick Drake to death

324
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,536
You know there's no films from the 60s with

325
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,120
Girls dancing around with flowers in their hair

326
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:18,752
What's Nick Drake at the soundtrack I mean it's not identified with that. It is

327
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
Culturally

328
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
Unanchored

329
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
So

330
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
It's free

331
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
To be

332
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,600
Adapted and embraced fine

333
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,024
People from other generations of people you know, for next to me

334
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,424
It doesn't serve said I am from the 60s you know

335
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,824
Nick Drake please give me

336
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,224
Please

337
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,424
I want to just sit on the ground

338
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,224
Come ride in my history

339
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,624

340
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,024
I'm just know how to find you are and your way

341
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,584

Beautiful Downtown Oakland California

346
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:53,792
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world

347
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
A man-made sound

348
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:02,240
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

349
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,128
Technology talk to us

350
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
It is a creation of Sonic trash

351
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:16,832
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

352
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,136
To make them more human

353
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
Turn the living room lights on

354
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
Okay

355
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,072
Dim the living room lights to 50%

356
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
Okay

357
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:35,520
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

358
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,592
Makes for a much more natural experience

359
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,384
Turn the living room lights on

360
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,480
Dim the living room lights to 50%

361
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:52,928
