What's happening

54
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,336

55
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,640
Altima got stuck with Geico

Explain how simple it was for people to sign up for their insurance online

58
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:11,488
So put this in the context for us because I've seen about a million of these at this point on all the time

59
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,816

Christopher Bravo

62
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:30,176
Is an insurance ad and there's any such as Geico anymore cuz now it's it's all these TV people selling insurance right

63
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,968
Does a president from 24

64
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:38,368
He selling insurance that loser boyfriend guy from 30 Rock who sells it to you

65

I love that you like them

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,352
Watch Miguel now that you're kicking that you have a favorite like back then

Before Geico there weren't any on so nobody could you you wouldn't nobody would be competing about witch hat with her

68
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,824
Favorite insurance commercial insurance commercials

69
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
I guess when Geico first cannon old office

70
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,456
Insurance is almost entirely marketed through Direct Mail

George Saunders

73
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,095
The title story is about a theme park

74
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,167
Which has come to learn how other civilizations live

75
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
Attractions are

76
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
Russian peasant Farm

77
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
Pioneer encampment

78
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
And why is Mountain hermit

79
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,871
Focus of the story though

80
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
Is on the prehistoric exhibit

81
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
But you actors

82
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
I want in a man

83
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
Play the part of cave husband and cable life

84
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:43,135
No Love the Way contrast two very different elements that shouldn't have gone together

85
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
It was like taking

86
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Unnatural

87
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Cable

88
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Stalactites

89
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Stalagmites

90
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
And I'm showing what life was like

91
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
Back in caveman

92
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,167
Hiring these Lo Ren actor

93
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
I have to admit I'm not feeling my best

94
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
I'm doing so bad

95
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,103
That I really have anything to complain about

96
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
Thought that I would actually verbally complain if I did have

97
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
The story is both very funny

98
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
And very sad

99
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,879
The cavemen husband takes his work super seriously

100
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
Using body language to communicate

101
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,279
How to break in character even though weeks pass when no visitors come by to watch

102
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
I'm sitting back on my haunches

103
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
Waiting for people to poke in their heads

104
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
Hello it's been 13 days

105
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
Has anyone pooped in their head

106
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,519
The cable man on the other hand speaks English all the time

107
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
Janet speaker

108
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,127
Chicken, a job and tries to get him to loosen up

109
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
Is partly why I feel so

110
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
You know

111
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Crummy

112
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
To the tedious routine

113
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
Pointless tasks

114
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,623
Elida language Echoes that of office life

115
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
Janet scratches under armpit

116
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Makes it sound like

117
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
Time lights a cigarette

118
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
What about you

119
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
Why you insist I'll never know

120
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Who's here

121
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
You see anyone here but us

122
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,263
At the end of each day they have to fill out daily partner evaluation forms

123
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,847
And the cave husband always says his cave wife is doing a good job

124
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
Even when she clearly not

125
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,455
A gesture to her. Put out the cigarette and make the fire

126
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
She gestures to me to kiss her butt

127
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,343
No idea walma Geico campaign

128
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
Gina's creative team

129
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
Whatever that is

130
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,463
Trying to come up with interesting analogies

131
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
Picture of baby

132
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
Can be potty trained

133
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,143
You could push the few buttons necessary to file a claim with Geico

134
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
Four puppets

135
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
Pulling fire alarms

136
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,311
None of their ideas felt right or special enough

137
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
We needed a break

138
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
And we

139
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,175
I had gone to lunch and we're sitting there eating your lunch

140
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,967
And then all the sudden I'm like

141
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
Wait a second please cavemen

142
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
From

143
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
The sondors bike like that

144
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,599
That's perfect

145
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
And

146
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
The whole slogan

147
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Came to me for life

148
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
It's so easy a caveman can

149
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,863
Which of course became the ads that you are probably picture in your head right now

150
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,679
Michael George Saunders story bad they're funny

151
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
But also a little sad

152
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:10,335
Sarcastic cavemen who seem truly Pain by the label that Society has given them

153
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Why did I bother you

154
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
Why does it bother me

155
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,551
So easy a caveman can do it

156
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,671
Geico.com so easy a therapist can do it

157
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,279
Therapist are what

158
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Mark

159
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,143
No says when the caveman commercials first aired

160
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,983
His agency received several letters from Individual viewers

161
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:43,871
Hacking of a blurry caveman playing a piano in the background of one of the spots with the actor Val Kilmer

162
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
Commercial put Geico on the map

163
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,551
So that got started wondering if she could trace the trail inspiration back even further

164
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
So she called him George Saunders ask him

165
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,695
About some the influences in his life that made him the kind of writer he is

166
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:02,815
Only when you're a writer and you going towards people talk a lot inspiration you have a carnival

167
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
List

168
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Piano

169
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
Will Shakespeare

170
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,359
Or at least it is coming from a different direction

171
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
And by different direction

172
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,711
What he's trying to say is Charlie Brown

173
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
Peanuts Christmas and Halloween

174
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
Embarrassingly

175
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Big

176
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
In my

177
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Childhood

178
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,183
I've never seen anything quite so totally

179
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,047
I know complicated or something that I felt a real direct line between

180
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,143
The way I was feeling about things in the way my neighborhood looking felt

181
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,471
I would do a lot of dreaming walking around the neighborhood

182
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,287
I really love that Lucy and Linus doing that

183
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Etsy

184
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
Assure you

185

186
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Really sacred

187
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,247
That's really valuable your neighborhood is really

188
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,807
It's important as any other place in the world

189
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,647
Eating a part of the king of influences Inc

190
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
Say something in the world

191
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
That intrude on us

192
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
Change it

193
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,071
But the other way to see it is there something in US

194
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
Find

195
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Mirror

196
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,727
And then I think when you go to do some work

197
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Something in your eyes

198
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,359
Jordan also influenced early on by the jerk

199
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
Mighty Python and Jaws

200
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
Mew the teenager

201
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,015
Listen to his favorite Yes album over and over and over again

202
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:30,111
Fixated on the way they had ordered their songs

203
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,951
What did he mean what did they mean by putting this one lasted that later

204
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
Influence how you

205
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,303
Ordered your stories and treasure icon

206
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
Michael Jordan became engineer

207
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,447
We first started seriously writing to read only authors who are dead

208
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,263
Hemingway Carrick Mahler

209
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,079
He consciously tried to avoid all living Riders

210
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
One day

211
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
Just to get it out of the way

212
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
He went to the Chicago Public Library

213
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
And piled together a stacked literary journals

214
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,879
My goal was read about 15 literary magazine so I could pin

215
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
Totally abandon

216
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,975
Contemporary story

217
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,767
Go back to China me anyway

218
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
Open the magazine

219
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,143
Start reading a story and then push it aside thinking it was dumb

220
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,215
Many came across the short story called hot ice

221
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
Play Chicago author named Stuart dybek

222
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
A work of literature

223
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,687
That was set in a physical place in time that I knew

224
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
And Lily in 15 minutes

225
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
Lyrics for in the understood

226
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,879
Relationship

227
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
But I mean like your stories are these

228
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
Hyper realistic

229
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,071
You're free to invent 100%

230
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
You can just make up whatever you want

231
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
Knowing that your spiritual

232
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,983
Even if it's a theme park

233
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
Kaitlyn

234
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,199
Whatever it takes ring to get this

235
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,503
Shinobu fine-looking

236
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,807
Streetsboro

237
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Poetry

238
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,623
Now that I didn't know what the hell

239
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,951
So crazy but at the end I was shaky at

240
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Tears my eyes

241
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,583
Face was red

242
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
How to write like that then

243
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Yep yep

244
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
Immediately lie like that night

245
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
Which got me thinking

246
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,799
What influenced Stuart dybek to write the way he did

247
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,639
I called him up at the place in Florida he runs every year

248
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
Boy catches fresh fish every morning

249
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
Enterprise I'm up for lunch

250
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,623
Stuart told me that when he first started writing it also fall in love with a great American realists

251
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,975
Saul Bellow and F Scott Fitzgerald and Nelson Aldrin

252
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,791
It never occurred to hand write any other way

253
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,863
He always wrote while listening to music

254
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
When he was 25

255
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,215
He became enchanted with two Hungarian composers

256
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
Zoltan kodaly and Bela Bartok

257
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,871
Play Traveller on Eastern Europe recording music on sonographic cylinders

258
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
He went to the Chicago Public Library

259
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,247
The same one that George Saunders would go two years later

260
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,039
And he discovered Stewart story

261
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,879
And checked out as many bar-top and kodali Records is he could find

262
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
Music on

263
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
Set down the right

264
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
Story about

265
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:21,375
Stuff we used to do as kids in the neighborhood tell Sam that I grew up in an inner-city neighborhood on the

266
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Southwest sign

267
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,031
Corny to say you went into a trance

268
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
But I was

269
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
I was taken out of my

270
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,687
Can answer I turn the music off and looked at the three or four pages

271
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
That I had written

272
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,087
I realize that I was writing in a way I had never imagined I could write

273
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
In a voice I didn't know I had

274
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,207
The music it just opened something up in

275
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,471
Listening to that music was the central thing that would happen to him as a writer

276
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:02,079
Everything from that point on was due to putting those two Records On

277
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:22,559
Bad influence by the composer

278
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
Did you say

279
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,399
Inspired by the work of the poet baudelaire

280
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
Who have the work of Edgar Allan Poe

281
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,543
Baudelaire wrote that he loved Poe because he was like him

282
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Quote

283
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
The first time I ever opened a book by Poe

284
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
I discovered

285
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
But the Rapture Nas

286
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
The only subject which I dreamt

287
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,087
The whole phrases I conceived written by Poe 20 years before

288
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:52,255
Destroy the Raven inspired by bird and Charles Dickens story Barnaby Rouge which poet actually panned in

289
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,303
Review he wrote In the book first came out

290
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
The burden that can story

291
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,399
Was inspired by his real-life pet

292
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
A raven named grip

293
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
Who died from eating paint chips

294
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
Which brings us back to the caveman

295
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
Shirley Drew

296
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247

I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff
