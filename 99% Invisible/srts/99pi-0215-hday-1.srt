I have one question for you

44
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,816
What do you think of when I tell you the date 3rd of September 19th 6

We called about a dozen sweet

49
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
For the most part

50
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,248
If they are alive and in country

51
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
For any part of the 19th

52
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,600
The date September 3rd 1960

53
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,904
87 was a hugely important

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
And Harold

55
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976

56
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,000
Each day

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:44,352
Yeah Hal short for hoga traffic on Landing

58
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
Or something like that

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,216
Sorry

60
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
Meaning of right-hand traffic diversion

61
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:57,152
Each day was the day that 7.8 million swedes switch the side of the road they drive on

62
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
From the left side to the right

63
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,064
It would be the most massive overhaul in driving infrastructure that any country

64
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
Had ever seen

65
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
Historically if you're riding a horse

66
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,072
You want to keep the last so that you can use your right hand

Black man with a sword

70
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,216
But with the Advent of the horse-drawn carriage

71
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,776
There were some conditions in which it made sense

72
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
What's the stick to the right

73
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
In customs could vary by country

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
Ennis cars became more common

75
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,712

Traffic

78
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
Up until 1967

79
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,600
Sweden drove on the left side of the road

80
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,416
Which set it apart from its neighboring countries

81
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
Finland Norway and Denmark

82
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
All of which drove on the right

83
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
And this presented problems

84
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,840
The biggest problem was

85
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
Accidents

When under started working with a

102
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,024
The Swedish government in the 1960s

103
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,119
They were tired of seeing swedes getting into car accidents abroad

104
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,935
And have interest and truck drivers from other countries

105
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
Getting into car accidents

106
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239

I'm driving

110
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:37,247
Swedish car companies made vehicles that were meant to be driven on the right

111
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,807
So they could be exported more easily

112
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,135
But these cars also found their way onto roads

113
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
In Sweden

Redbox app Roku

115
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,279
Mainly having your steering wheel on the outside edge of the road

Overtake

117
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,143
Or call seeing as you say in your country

118
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,959
You don't see the oncoming cars

119
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
It was a big mess

120
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,383
Swedish government thought it could get a lot better if they just switched what side of the road they drove on if they can drive on the right like most of Europe

121
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:09,503
Legislative action to switch driving side have been attempted before you times

122
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,295
But it always fail

123
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
And then in the early 1960s

124
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
The Swedish government thought that this

125
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Could be the time

126
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
They put it to a public vote

127
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
Asking the Swedish populist

128
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583

129
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119

00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143

136
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,871
So the government just went ahead and did it anyway

137
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
Sweden life

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,735

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
I'm the third one

One of unders is jobs is helping to come up with informational materials for the switch

158
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Like a pamper

159
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
Never explain what would be different

160
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
What to watch out for

161
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
And what rules

162
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
Apollo and just take it

163
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,071
Second to think about what kind of a job this is

164
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
If you've ever been in a car

165
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
Driving on the opposite side of what you're used to

166
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
Everything feels wrong

167
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,031
Do you need to teach people to identify what is actually correct

168
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
Even though it feels wrong

169
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
And what exactly does

170
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
Wrong wrong

171
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,479
The pamphlet Anders and his team worked on shows where your car goes

172
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
When you make a right turn

173
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
For a left turn

174
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
How to pass

175
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,879
Pedestrian should be aware of

176
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
Hosea 7 Drive

177
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,535
The two most important things that

178
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
The pamphlet did was

179
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,143
One to familiarize Sweden with a new traffic sign

180
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
The six

181
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Formed

182
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Side

183
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
Wizard meaning

184
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
H

185
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Hands of me

186
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,591
A hexagon sign with an H in it

187
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
Age for hugger or right

188
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,967
These signs will be visible on the road after the switch

189
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
And they're also little stickers with an H

190
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,111
You can put on the inside of your windshield to remind yourself while you're driving

191
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:26,463
And I might still spot NH sticker inside some of the older cars in Sweden

192
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:31,327
The second super important part of the public education campaign

193
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
What's the date

194
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
The switch

195
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
September 3rd

196
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Nineteen

197
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
67

198
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
Dog and ho

199
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
HD

200
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,663
The pamphlet was a good start and getting people ready for a stay but soon the government realized they needed to bring out the big guns

201
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,807
They wanted to unleash their nation's most effective weapon for penetrating people's hearts and Minds

202
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Pop

203
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,519
Wings television station had put out a competition to come up with the best

204
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
Song to teach people

205
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
About H day

206
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
The winner

207
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:21,759
The telstar's withholding still hug in Spanish

208
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:26,367
Translation

209
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
Keep to the right svensson

210
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,583
Svendsen being a stereotypically common Swedish last name like Smith

211
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Or Jones

212
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
Tulsa bit of wordplay here

213
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
In Swedish

214
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,495
Keeping to the right as shorthand for being faithful

215
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Your spouse

216
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
Going left

217
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
Means having an affair

218
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,151
The government had spent four years getting the country ready

219
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,223
Official HD pamphlet had gone out to every Swede

220
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
Dispensing song

221
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Have logic

222
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Self in people's brains

223
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,111
Psa's headset rated

224
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
McDonald

225
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
September has arrived

226
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,631
The evening of the 2nd

227
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
The came the morning

228
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
The 3rd

229
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
Everyone knew the drill

230
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
HD was here

231
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,615
All non-essential traffic was banned from the roads from late night to early morning

232
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
Most cars were kept off the road

233
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,991
The only people on the roadways were construction Crews

234
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,063
Taxi drivers who were given the okay from the government

235
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,855
And I hand-picked few

236
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Like this guy

237
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
It was great fun

238
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:36,255
Chukar saltonstall, and I has

239
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
Black one of the very few

240
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
Go to permission to drive at night

241
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
What's for dinner

242
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
This is Bo holmstrom

243
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:49,567
Well I'm go home store Monmouth Swedish journalist I'll be working since 1960

244
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,895
In the television has a television reporter

245
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
A 19-6

246
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
27 I was working on

247
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,295
Switch to right hand drive traffic

248
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
And then

249
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
I'm doing a lot of stories

250
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,439
But was actually a pretty famous broadcast journalist

251
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,999
Kind of like a Swedish Tom Brokaw

252
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,655
At the time this was the big story oh yeah we were on there almost all night.

253
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,983
After two transmitting from different points in Sweden

254
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,639
Accessories

255
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
Work Crews were out putting up the hexagonal H signs

256
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
The ones remaining you drive on the right plus they had to flip around and move pretty much every street sign

257
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Sign in the country

258
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
What I saw of a changing of signs

259
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
Turning them the other way

260
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,583
And then changing all the signs at bus stops

261
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,655
It's such a great feeling to biking around

262
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,239
10 years old and there was no traffic

263
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:56,639
A few of the random Suites that we reached on the phone we're also they are on each day

264
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,967
A song that will schooling repeatedly on the radio

265
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
Country codes

266
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Benson

267
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Something

268
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,975
Roundabouts were reconfigured for people to go counter-clockwise

269
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,999
Clockwise

270
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
Freeway off-ramps became on-ramps

271
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,959
Temporary bus stops were set up in the middle of the street to accommodate buses that now had doors on the wrong side

272
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
At 4:50 a.m.

273
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
Horn blared across Stockholm

274
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
Ana loudspeaker announced

275
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,639
Now is the time to change over

276
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,711
And then under the direction of thousands of traffic

277
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
Despatched around the country

278
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
All of the cars in Sweden

279
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
May the way to the right

280
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
For the most part

281
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,927
The HD transition team had accounted for

282
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
For everything

283
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
But it was disorienting

284
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,023
And not everyone was a happy camper

285
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,815
Some people said they got lost

286
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
They were in their own City

287
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
Then

288
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,703
I've been driving there for 4 years

289
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:58,335
Them you were used to take care of it one way street for example and it will say the one way but the other way

290
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,151
So go as I wanted

291
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
I remember

292
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,759
1 old lady or middle-aged

293
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,831
Hey you sitting in the passenger seat in one car when stopped

294
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
And she was mad

295
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Mad as hell

296
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
Saying we didn't want this

297
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
We voted against

298
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,047
Everybody was against going over

299
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
Them politicians

300
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,239
Thousands of people killed in the traffic instead

301
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,799
Here's the really amazing thing about 8

302
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
Each day and the ship

303
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
What is a hole

304
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,663
The total number of traffic-related deaths

305
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Ponhd

306
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
With zero

307
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,807
In fact the total number of accidents went down for a while

308
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,879
There were a lot of people thinking that they should be

309
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Catastrophe

310
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
There should be thousands of dead people

311
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Ananda traffic

312
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
It isn't

313
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:56,191
Likely because everyone was so freaked out about driving on what felt like the wrong side of the road.

314
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,983
Everyone drove

315
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
Really slowly and carefully

316
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,639
A year after Sweden switch sides of the road Iceland also switch

317
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,943
Driving on the right to be more like the rest of Europe

318
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,247
The United Kingdom and Ireland

319
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:16,159
1970s former British colonies including Ghana and Nigeria switch from left to right to be more like their neighbors

320
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
In West Africa and the rest of the world

321
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
Today

322
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,863
The vast majority of the world drives on the right and then places the do drive on the left

323
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,959
Like in the UK movements occasionally spring up trying to get the country

324
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
To switch to the right

325
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,799
But there is one notable exception

326
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Rough Country

327
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Went left

328
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,431
Office of the Prime Minister of someone how may I help you

329
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Samoa

330
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,271
Hi this is Will Coley calling from New York

331
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
Hello mister

332
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,367
Sikuli is an island Republic in the South Pacific

333
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,927
Not to be confused with American Samoa which is

334
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
East

335
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Of Samoa

336
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
In 2009 they did the opposite of

337
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,839
Sweden and nearly every other country who made the switch

338
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,887
They went from driving on the right

339
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
To driving

340
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
On the way

341
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,751
Will Coley called up the guy responsible for the change

342
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,335
Okay hold on for a minute I'll transfer the call

343
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
Okay thank you so much

344
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,087
Yes this is the actual Hole music the office

345
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
Hello

346
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
Hi prime minister

347
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:28,607
Prime minister of Samoa

348
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,935
Switching to the left offered one major obvious benefit

349
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,031
Aligning Samoa more closely with the biggest nearby Econo

350
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
Australia

351
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
New Zealand

352
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
And Japan

353
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
All of which drive on the left

354
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:45,247
Something that we have been nothing for a long time

355
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
Monica concert

356
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,111
We needed to import keepass

357
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,719
Samoa wanted to import cheap used cars from nearby Japan

358
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
Ashley

359
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
Cheapest

360
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:04,959
Call Marcus in the world the cars in Japan are made to be driven on the left so Samoa decided to make the switch

361
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Two left side driving

362
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
HBO common sense

363
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,079
By all accounts the day of the switch

364
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
September 7th 2009

365
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Was released

366
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,223
It probably helped that they're only a couple of major roads to modify

367
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,319
It began with the radio announcement from prime minister Malayalam Maui

368
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,927
Today we will launch

369
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:30,303
The great event

370
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
On the right hand side of the road

371
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,287
She was magnificent

372
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:44,895
Are gloves that was great but you said right hand I think you meant left

373
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,967
Right

374
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
Stick to the right svensson

375
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,599
Prime minister Malayalam Maui stick to the left

376
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
