Roman Mars

25
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:13,728
Logos used to be a thing that people really didn't give much thought to

26
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:20,128
The last decade the volume and intensity of arguments about logos have increased substantially

27
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,920
This is just the internet being

28
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:27,040
The internet but logo redesign in particular a lot of hyperbolic vitriol

29
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,392
I was wondering what this felt like to desiigner so I talked to one of my favorites

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:36,512
Michael bierut is an aiga medalist and partner at the international design consultancy pentagram

What is work includes brand identity logos book design and packaging

32
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,960
At this point I'm talking with them I just thought I'd put a conversation hours it down episode

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
Many of you might be familiar with the logos be discussed but if you need a little help jog your memory this is a great episode

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,432
Go to listen to as you scroll that the images

35
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,224

At 99 Pi. Org

37
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,832
Michael says that for a very long time

38
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
No one understood what his job

39
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,184
As a graphic designer really meant

40
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,464
But recently

41
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
That's changed

42
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,584
Aren't you at now a lot of times people will say

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,192
Also do you do logos or though alright ask me what I think of

44
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,776
Awesome logo this in the news and this is entirely

45
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
New and

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
Kind of startling

47
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Unnerving

48
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,712
What is the most recent logo they've asked you

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272
Let me ask about your own logo

50
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,600
Oh yeah oh yeah yeah I know I was like as if they didn't know

51
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:38,976
Absolutely I was back in early 2015

52
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
I was engaged in a secret project

53
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,328
Which was to design a logo for

54
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,864
For the campaign of

55
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
As of yet on

56
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
McLaren Canada

57
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
President Hillary

58
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
Quinton

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
And

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
It launched there was a

61
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
Huge amount of attention

62
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Chivas logo witch

63
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
Became ubiquitous

64
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
I think the age with the arrow in it

65
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
And at one point before it was widely known that I was a designer but I got an email from a magazine say

66
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
That they were convenient

67
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
A bunch of

68
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,928
Designer is to volunteer to say how they would

69
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
Design the logo

70
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
Cuz it was so horrible

71
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,328
And so like we'd like to know how would you design if you could have done anything and I sort of

72
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
You know I just said all you know

73
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,912
I think I'll pass

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
So tell me a bit more how they Hillary logo

75
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,360
It used to be that people would run for

76
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,664
Political office and they didn't understand

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
But they needed a while ago and maybe they didn't

78
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Need a logo

79
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
Barack Obama changed all that in

80
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
2008 Duran and

81
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,672
He had this now famous

82
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
O for Obama

83
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
In blue with sort of

84
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Red

85
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,816
Stripes leaving

86
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
Into the center of the o with

87
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
The old-time symbolizing

88
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
A setting or probably more likely a rising sun

89
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,776
And that symbol was so ubiquitous both

90
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,872
In 2008 the fact that he one kind of sealed the deal

91
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
It appeared

92
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,968
Over the next eight years representing his candidacy in the world

93
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,528
Go on to Brandeis Zoom

94
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Foundation

95
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Library

96
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Post presidential activities

97
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
With that kind of established as a

98
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
The benchmark

99
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
For political campaigns

100
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
By the time

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,303
2016 rolls around every candidate

102
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,887
One way or another had one bailout logo and very early on in

103
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
2015

104
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
Beginning of the year I got a call from

105
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Team that was

106
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
Was Consulting with Hillary

107
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
Frequently asked me whether I

108
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
Would volunteer my services

109
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,895
Create a logo for secretary Clinton

110
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,991
And what we wanted to do was exploit some of the

111
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
Characteristics that

112
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,831
People would come to appreciate I think

113
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
Possibly by accident

114
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
And about the Obama wall

115
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,463
One of which was that it could be adapted

116
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Two different forms you could have

117
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,559
You could kind of why customized at four different groups

118
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
The Boulders are different

119
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Locations

120
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Senso

121
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,447
We have this idea like what if we had a symbol that you could

122
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
Change every day if you want

123
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
If you can make it

124
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Celebrate

125
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
LGB

126
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,639
Meteorites one day and celebrate Veterans the next day and then modified

127
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,479
For Memorial Day the day after that or Halloween the day after that

128
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
Listening very simple

129
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,319
So we can wrap this very simple h

130
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
With an arrow going

131
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Kind of symbolizes

132
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
We thought that the candidate was moving

133
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
Country forward and also

134
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Forgiving us

135
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
A way to

136
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
You kind of

137
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,559
Point that age that other thing

138
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Meaning that Hillary

139
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
4

140
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
Or better in

141
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
Meteorites

142
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
For me

143
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,751
And it just kind of like proved to be a really

144
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
Malleable weibley

145
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,615
System in the air

146
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
This sort of

147
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Device

148
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
For one thing no one really

149
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
Boats

150
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
Logos they both

151
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Candidates

152
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
Play button a boat for people who they say

153
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,415
Think will improve their wives and some actual not

154
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
People that flashy logos

155
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,279
You know often if some

156
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,375
Tangible symbol will crystallize in the voting Public's mind

157
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
10 lbs and see what a candidate is and I think

158
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Just as

159
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
You know Hillary perhaps had that

160
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
With an arrow in it

161
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
By the time

162
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
Election day

163
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
You know I was seeing it everywhere and

164
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
And certain way

165
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
You know what the convention

166
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,991
Tencent Javits Convention Center that night

167
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
For the

168
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Party

169
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
People had an embroidered on

170
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Temporary tattoo

171
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
Leatherface is it was every

172
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,047
You know the same time her opponent had a red hat

173
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,399
What's up with the slogan on the front of it you know in that in a way was a logo for that

174
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,495
So I think there's a substance of what people are promising

175
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
And there's

176
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
Sort of the

177
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,103
Tangible bit of shorthand

178
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
Thumbs up

179
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
That promise is

180
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,759
And I think that in the commercial world that's what symbols have always done

181
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
You know you're meant to

182
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,111
Kind of ascribe all sorts of higher

183
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,927
Transcendent values of things like a

184
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
Basketball sneakers end

185
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Soda

186
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:00,351
Soda pops in Owen instead the transcended values with them athletic achievement

187
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
Refreshment

188
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
Respectively

189
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,215
And somehow devices

190
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,055
Spike's wishes or dynamic ribbons or whatever you want to say

191
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
TriStar kind of meant to be the holders

192
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
Does that mean ain't that

193
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Is then

194
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
Reinforced Viagra

195
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
Fertilizing and buy

196
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,247
Hopefully actual for Santa

197
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
Experienced with

198
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Product

199
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
Is interesting I never really

200
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
Thought of

201
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,647
The Hat being a logo

202
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Could you sort of

203
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,303
Pull-A-Part some of its qualities as to what it's convenient to you and why it works

204
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,631
I think what was interesting about Donald Trump

205
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,727
Red make America great hat was that one it's very it's very

206
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
It was sort of thing

207
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,567
It's clearly not something one Associates

208
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,407
With Coastal Elites you know who are intellectuals although I know

209
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:54,879
Now and then so maybe I'm not going to leave now from Ohio after all but I mean it is sort of a r

210
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,719
It's definitely not suited for a black tie or business

211
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511
Satire is meant to be sore.

212
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,583
The kind of thing you associate maybe with them

213
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
With hard-working

214
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
Salt-of-the-earth Americans

215
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
The bed that is red is sort of making a really

216
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
Clear statement about on

217
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
Read America let's say

218
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
And the slogan

219
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
Make America great again

220
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
All caps

221
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
Caprock

222
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
Yelling athlete

223
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
Kind of reminded

224
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
People of the

225
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
Candidates on

226
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Delivery

227
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Those words

228
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
And I think most importantly

229
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,719
Wasn't an underground thing was very visible if you sort of wars

230
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Porter

231
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,559
You put that thing right on your head

232
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:39,423
You know and it was like if someone's looking at your face they would look at that hat made read those words to know

233
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
Wearable Brands like that sort of

234
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,335
Tattoos are sort of the bitten a big commitment you make to kind of advertising someone else

235
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
Calls himself

236
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
I assumed that he had boughten

237
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Custom stickers

238
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,735
Signs and stuff like that but that had witch

239
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
The Warren

240
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
Was like really calling on P

241
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
I personally identify with that candidate in a really on a

242
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,255
So the Hillary H with an arrow logo is released in people react to it the way they

243
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,887
React to any logo right now is really active discussion online whenever a new one is

244
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Done

245
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,215
It is also in the context of this political campaign

246
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
She got

247
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,871
Unbelievable not a criticism no matter what she did but I remember people reacting to

248
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
The age of the arrow

249
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,943
Willie strongly some of it quite an egg

250
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Were you

251
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,295
Prepared for that in any way

252
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
Would have taken me aback

253
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:35,231
What I should have seen coming is that logo was I actually personally thought was and still think was really good I mean

254
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,303
No it was exactly the one that we wanted

255
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,887
The campaign to use we are confident that over

256
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
The course of the campaign will be used in all sorts of ways that would win people over and I think I was largely proven out

257
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
I mean I think by

258
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,151
The time November came around if you sort of like went on the

259
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
Pantsuit Nation

260
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:00,575
Facebook page you would see a million different expressions of a tall homegrown and

261
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Grassroots in really really fun

262
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:08,511
And I remember saying while we were working while we were looking all the different options logo I remember saying you know

263
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
I want something

264
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
It's so simple that a

265
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,167
First grader could do it with construction paper Elmer's glue in

266
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Kindergarten scissors

267
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,519
Christina I didn't want a fancy thing you needed to know software programs

268
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
To create I wanted something

269
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
What is easy to draw

270
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Heart

271
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
Or a

272
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Peace sign

273
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
Horse smiling

274
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,247
Face you know something that could be that ubiquitous and I think we

275
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
Got pretty close to

276
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,831
It's just a very simple piece of geometry into

277
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
2 primary colors

278
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Now

279
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
Really

280
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
Doll

281
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
What happens

282
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
When somebody that has warrants

283
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
Just put out there in

284
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
To you know

285
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
The uncaring world

286
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:48,959
People treated as a it's open-endedness Ashley at that moment works against it is

287
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
Treated as a Rorschach blot and everyone project

288
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Jingdong

289
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
Standoff this happens

290
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
What's sports team

291
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
Names that happens with colleges

292
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Beijing University

293
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
But I think I underestimated

294
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
Headed to the greed of which would happen with the political

295
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Call candidate wear

296
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
Someone is well known as

297
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
Secretary Clinton you know has

298
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
Why do people have opinions about already and then suddenly there this

299
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
Convenient thing upon which two

300
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
Reject opinions I may have already had

301
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Or pinyin

302
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,935
So they just thought were clever or whatever it was and so suddenly

303
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
You know what I kind of would Marvel

304
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Sometimes I would say it's just

305
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,335
Some straight line some 90° angle sum

306
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
45 degree angles

307
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:33,503
Listen to primary colors it doesn't mean you know what's it's at me and I said was an age

308
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,319
Because it's that's the

309
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
The candidates because of age

310
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,719
It's a narrow cuz she wants to move the country forward and it's red white and blue

311
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
Because of America

312
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,119
And yet

313
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,519
I was I was kind of taken aback but I shouldn't have been actually and I have to come down to the campaign who

314
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,079
Resolute about Thera

315
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,687
Commitment to attend in fact really brought us a wife and made it really sing over

316
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
Summer months

317
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,343
Still are in contrast there was a notorious cell logo that was unveiled

318
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
When

319
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Donald Trump

320
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,183
Identified his running mate

321
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
In the form of governor

322
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Pants

323
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:21,119
And I had this TP like a chair that a lot of people thought they saw you know unsavory things in

324
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,959
Fan made fun of it and animated it in in ways that

325
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
Salacious

326
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,287
And it was like it just was mated

327
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Disappear

328
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
And all kind of

329
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:35,711
Blink at you I know it's going to be a while ago and you really are committed to at the worst thing you can do is hurt a boy

330
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,807
Oops forgot that we're making that go away and forget you ever saw

331
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:46,207
If you stick to it it just act like you really mean it eventually the world will get used to it and then eventually if you wait longer

332
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
People be outraged if you try to

333
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Redesign it into

334
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
Do you remember the first time

335
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
There was a public

336
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,519
Fight about a logo where normal people like got involved

337
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,823
Soap for years kind of

338
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
Like logo redesigns was

339
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,151
Very esoteric thing

340
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
For people like me who would gone

341
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
2

342
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
Art school to learn to be graphic

343
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
Designers would sort of

344
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
Did you see they change the UPS wall

345
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Blower for UPS

346
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,439
Delivery trucks and I know who designed the original logo I know who did

347
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
The redesign I know what kind of

348
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,791
Things to say about it and everyone sort of like wood tok

349
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
You know chat rooms on websites

350
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
Comment for days on the

351
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Pros and cons of

352
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Things like that

353
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
Public was

354
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
The gap

355
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
Loaded

356
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
A redesign of its logo

357
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,735
It appeared online and suddenly someone said oh my God the Gap the

358
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
The retail store the Gap is going to read

359
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
Redesign its logo

360
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
And

361
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
2

362
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
Price of the gap

363
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Aldi's

364
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183
Consumers started getting like really

365
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
Agitated about him started

366
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
I'm saying it out

367
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,815
Save the old Gap logo you know where this new logos

368
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
Ridiculous

369
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
What's usually the criticism is wise to

370
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,471
Is that my four-year-old could a design that new logo 92

371
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,823
I think that's a good thing I like what was that for

372
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,639
Call but on the most people they started seem like logos

373
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
Those are sophisticated things that need to be

374
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
Design with complicated equipped

375
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
Mumbai

376
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
Scope of people

377
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,831
And they also assume that a lot of money was spent

378
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
How much was someone paid to do

379
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Staying in Osaka

380
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
I remember that the gap

381
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
And sort of what this logo

382
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
Float around out there that was

383
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Not the

384
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Blue box

385
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,119
The highway condensed serif Waters ga

386
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
Familiar with

387
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
What it was

388
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,215
Lowercase helvetica with this

389
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
Superimposed faded Blue Square

390
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
Put off center on the letters

391
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
And for some reason it just really

392
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,967
Aggravated people I even I was surprised by that and people ask

393
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,039
My opinion other than a normal person

394
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,319
Google logo before

395
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:52,159
That's became that there's somebody started happening more and more in this in

396
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
The years to follow so I

397
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,511
Something about social media something about the internet County

398
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
I was unable to

399
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
They definitely blank on that

400
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:06,239
They sort of I think they denied they ever meant did you know that was just something we're experimenting with don't worry we've heard

401
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
Loyal customers loud

402
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Claire Randolph

403
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
Never fear we shampoo

404
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
Changing the gap

405
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Logo

406
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,455
Daniel was interesting is that of course that's a logo

407
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
Doing exactly what it's supposed to do

408
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
I mean when

409
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,367
People are being sold logos are told that they will be the

410
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
Receptacle

411
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
All the passion

412
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
That the

413
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,767
Consumers have for a brand which is this

414
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Is kind of weird

415
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,863
Hard to express thing otherwise but now all the sudden

416
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
This will be the focal out

417
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
Which all that wall is going to

418
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
Aimed and

419
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
Naturally then

420
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
The customers think that they own

421
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,151
Can a company like you know has the

422
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,199
Temerity to change it without asking anyone

423
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
Permission suddenly the customers who have been told

424
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
Wildest thing

425
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
Officer

426
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
Be the focal object

427
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,391
Upon which all that wall is going

428
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
How to be a man

429
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
And

430
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
Naturally then but

431
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:03,583
The customers think that they own the logo you know and then when the company you like

432
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
You know has the temerity

433
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
To change it without asking him

434
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,215
Permission suddenly the customers who have been told this

435
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
Marvelous thing

436
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
Awesomest change ottoman without warning and they get like freaked out you think that General design awareness in the public

437
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
Has made your job

438
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
Easier or harder

439
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,551
Oh I think it's it's made it easier and it's made it more fun

440
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
And I would say

441
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,623
I've always thought that what I do

442
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
Why do we sing the most important

443
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
But I always thought it was him

444
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
Devoted my wife

445
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
Define daft

446
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
People notice that

447
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,399
And I don't think we can ask people to notice our work and thinking

448
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
Can about and then presume to tell

449
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
People

450
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,383
But you can only say positive things about it's an hour I think you I mean if it's if he were to talk about

451
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,687
Inform people about it

452
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,807
Empire large people like I think negative comments are always more fun to read them positive

453
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,623
What's a rave reviews a little doll tree but I mean

454
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,695
I've never had anyone forward Mia of positive rest

455
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,047
Yeah like I'm the other hand if it's the restaurant or the New York Times takes a restaurant

456
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Heart

457
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
You know the relative

458
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:12,191
Which all that writer will describe every dish is just a sight to

459
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Bhldn

460
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
And I think you know so I think you know it's criticism is much more fun to write and more fun

461
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,455
Read and unless we want to go back to having no one notice what we're doing and pretending like

462
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
Doesn't matter at all we should do

463
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
You stalker

464
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
I have

465
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
I mean is there a way

466
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
To get you

467
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:35,743
To criticism we can be figured out what's your sword Jiu-Jitsu method of dealing with it

468
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
Jana partners and I

469
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
Michael gareki and I

470
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,655
Redesign the logo for the Big Ten football conference

471
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:47,007
Prince and the needs to be redesigned because it was called the big time but it had 11

472
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
Teamcenter

473
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
That and the other

474
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
Clever logo that combined

475
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,663
The words Big Town written out with the number 11

476
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Kind of hiding by the

477
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,711
74 town

478
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,039
So we sort of like you could do with simultaneously read

479
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
10 and 11 while looking at it which I just thought was

480
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,183
You know it's a nice solution to a problem which actually

481
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,023
Shouldn't be focused on you know I mean let's not celebrate this weird

482
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
Disconnect between

483
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
The name of the conference

484
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
The number of actual

485
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,167
And they were going to 12

486
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,519
The whole thing was they decided to kind of what just come up with a logo that wasn't

487
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
Based on

488
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
The actual number team

489
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,943
Call the Big Ten Conference so we did basically a logo that was

490
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
Made out of the letters big4

491
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
Big and then we did a treatment

492
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,367
The eye and big in the G and Biggs would have a double reed

493
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
The number to

494
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
And so when that was unveiled

495
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,255
Oh I actually got voicemail about if

496
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Trampoline

497
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:48,191
What's wrong with you people are those people are the loyal fans and I remember someone at all the big tank on

498
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,495
When this logo launch sort of telling me

499
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
This is the

500
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:56,639
This is the passion that kind of makes him sit in those seats when the weather is terrible and

501
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,479
And the same pasture to make them take it personally when you put it with the logo f***

502
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,015
What happens is

503
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,807
Once people get over the shock

504
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
If you can hold on tight

505
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Don't get

506
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,207
Used to the new logo and

507
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,535
If it's any good at all it'll soon be the Beloved

508
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,607
Big Ten logo and people will sort of like then

509
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,239
Lumberjack the next time it's changed as long as people still care about the big toenail care about it every time is change

510
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,311
And I have to admit we're entering a stage now where

511
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
I have work

512
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
The clients on

513
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:33,247
Doing logos and doing updates to logos where I can tell

514
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,783
The worst thing that could happen

515
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
When is if no one react

516
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Acted at all

517
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,135
The best thing would be if every analog dead

518
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
But the

519
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
The worst will be of no one knows

520
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,743
Is there like happiness or white tape

521
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,767
The outrage just

522
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Because

523
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:50,911
Wow people really care about us it's easy people to care about a sports team or university

524
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
It's a little bit harder to make people

525
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
Don't care about her

526
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,031
Retail brand but people don't do Steve's

527
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
Feel buried

528
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Retail store

529
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Put those garments Reddit

530
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Antibodies

531
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,919
And I think it's actually

532
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
What harder to make it will care about Finance

533
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
The more abstract

534
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Two-player amor

535
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
Disenrolling our wives

536
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,439
All of them now I'm will get comments on Logo updates and I

537
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,279
I think that you just you that you use to sort of whether it is he just sort of think

538
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,583
Well people are going to react to change

539
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,655
You should strongly sometimes but the strength that reaction is Ash

540
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
Directly related

541
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
The depth of feeling they have about the

542
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Brand that you're

543
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Representing

544
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
So

545
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,103
It's a little bit bad news equal

546
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
Have you ever had a

547
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,455
One-on-one interaction with a

548
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Person

549
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
Buckeye fan

550
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,575
Enraged and and how did it go

551
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,903
With those Buckeye fans

552
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,719
I had this policy of

553
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
Responding

554
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:53,119
They found out somehow it came out that we're done in the people found our emails and I start getting forwarded

555
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
These emails that had a lot of

556
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,263
How dare you were out of here how much you charge you should be ashamed of yourself for

557
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
Tell my father who is class of

558
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
23 is spinning in his

559
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,895
Musgrave

560
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:10,271
And I would always write back in this really kind of courteous way saying one

561
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,135
It's always disappointing to work hard on something to know that people don't like it

562
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,928
I can only hope that you

563
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
Overtime

564
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
Come to

565
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
At least get used to it

566
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:25,888
Ideally come to like it as much as we do or at the very least not having bother you quite as much

567
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
But I know that

568
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
Team values

569
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
Is the strong feelings

570
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,544
You have about them and as a fellow fan

571
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,336
That's the thing that we all really

572
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,432
I would write something like that and then I really meant it to I really meant every element

573
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
And that about

574
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,760
Two-thirds of the people I would Raichu

575
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,064
Would write me back in this

576
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
Chastened sort of tone

577
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:52,512
Where they say old of things I'm sorry I thought I was going over the top a little bit I still don't like it but I

578
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,816
I was happy to hear explanation and

579
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,632
I'm sorry I kind of like fire that off to you in the Heat of the Moment

580
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:02,240
Apologize but clearly the one that was there was really obvious was that the

581
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
The thing that really bothered them the most

582
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,104
Was their sense that giant

583
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
Impersonal

584
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,176
Temperate forests

585
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
Worm

586
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,736
Arbitrarily

587
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
Changing

588
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,552
Things that they cared about personally

589
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
With no

590
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
Thought of

591
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,416
Who they were you know as fans and what

592
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,048
Gene Juarez or anything like that in the idea that there was a human being with a name and a boys who might

593
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,608
Share of their feelings in any way whatsoever

594
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,144
You can tell it wasn't with your pics

595
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,704
It's a very satisfying Target

596
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,032
If you just think somewhere up there in a horrible people are messing with

597
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
What's something that I like an hour

598
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,104
Ruined I hate you you know

599
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,480
And then if see if I fall is something that person shows up in person it's a little bit kind of going

600
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,272
Turning point mean that so

601
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,648
These people I'm just like I sincerely feel bad

602
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,768
I'm not trying to make people mad I want people to like the thing I design and I'm sort of

603
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Almost

604
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,888
Always convinced at the moment that eventually if the thing I've designed

605
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,448
Is well-crafted and is

606
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
Really

607
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,520
Appropriate for its purpose

608
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
Misfits the team

609
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,848
It's the audience eventually

610
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
Welcome to

611
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
Play the same role little lies

612
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
Did that replace

613
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,016
And in logos or interest

614
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,576
Because I designed a lot of things out of science

615
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
The book covers

616
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
And a book cover that is one moment

617
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
Truth when you're

618
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
Find a book in a bookstore you walk down the aisle and

619
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,816
She catches your eye and then you think of

620
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
This looks interesting you pick it up

621
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,168
And you decide to buy it then you experience the raft

622
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
There is basically

623
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,472
Walking self and the world

624
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
Isn't

625
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Consequential

626
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:45,408
What was so you're one of the few things that appreciate in value as their

627
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
Used if you picture

628
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,040
You know really simple logos that are iconic in the American

629
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Commercial land

630
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Like

631
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
A Target logo sale

632
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,904
The Nike Swoosh

633
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
These are things that you know

634
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
84 year old

635
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,280
Define are really simple looking

636
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,608
Have no inherent meaning well the Target logo has

637
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,168
A meeting about that people find exasperate

638
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
Great hanging out with you

639
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,240
If you're hiring some fancy design from

640
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,264
Google logo for company

641
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,568
Target may come back and they say we came up with something

642
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
Really great

643
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,664
Here it is and it's a Target

644
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,968
How long did it take

645
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:26,368
But I mean think about think about how much they've been able to do with the Simplicity that Mark thing about how they've been

646
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,648
Manipulate very simple

647
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
All sorts of

648
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,976
Thanks and I would argue that that logo

649
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Google Now

650
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
We all sleep aid

651
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
We're back in the sea

652
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Commissioned

653
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
It's worth a hundred times

654
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,424
What is your least favorite aspect

655
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
Of the heated

656
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
Russian around

657
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Logos are we

658
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Knights when they have a

659
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,384
What's the type of criticism where you just like that's not

660
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,016
If you design something new people for some reason are so

661
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,088
Desperate to reconcile it with something already

662
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,160
Familiar with that they'll say oh that looks exactly like this other

663
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
And sometimes

664
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,560
Depending on their frame of mind they'll say that looks exactly like this other thing that could be

665
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
Something Bailey

666
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
Smarty like

667
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
Male or female

668
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:14,496
Anatomy or something like that looks like so much of that goes around

669
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:20,896
And no matter what you design you know they have this very human need to kind of turn abstract shapes into something

670
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
Figurative that means something

671
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,528
Really I mean what logos are meant to be

672
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
Empty vessels

673
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
Into which meaning is

674
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
Poornima meaning

675
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,928
When they work right is the meaning that your first-hand experience

676
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Represented by the logo

677
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
And I thank God

678
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,304
When someone just says oh that looks like a

679
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,400
Did you see it you know this sort of is tough also

680
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,472
I've never actually committed this are all the way but

681
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:52,128
If you're practicing graphic designer. Young graphic designer out there I'll one bit of advice I have is if you're like working on a

682
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
Logo

683
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,456
That is like a say it's us

684
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Quasi

685
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,528
You know it's a geometric logo with a

686
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
The four parts

687
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
Kind of thing

688
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,880
The kind of Hazzard

689
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,696
A rotational angular rotational aspect

690
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,488
If someone says

691
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,536
That kind of reminds me of a swastika

692
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,864
You won't just

693
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
You know that's a signal you should

694
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
That that logo will not be

695
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Presented

696
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,384
To anyone just put it away actually that sort of his life that that's close to me you can say it looks like a penis and like

697
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,432
You can actually get over that but I mean

698
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
What was

699
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
It's just like really

700
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,064
I remember I was going to a meeting with a

701
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,600
A client

702
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:40,000
Privately had a little twins with a really light and it sort of had these kind of geometric

703
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:46,400
Characteristics

704
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728
Carry the thing

705
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,544
It's about meeting and not even being a minister me in there

706
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,104
It was like an intern in The Intern

707
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
Sad

708
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,688
Like almost like

709
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
Bursting into

710
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:06,112
Cheers and say now you've ruined everything I going to me I said this one

711
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:10,208
Yeah I'm sorry

712
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,768
I guess I hate that the most

713
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Someone says

714
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,680
It looks like an emblem of the most evil political and cultural force of the twentieth century that's not good

715
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:26,336
And I just want to show you about that was the swastika was this perfectly abstract

716
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,640
Harmless and even kind of benevolent symbol

717
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
Centuries

718
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,712
Spiritual insignia.

719
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
Hawaiian Over

720
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
Application in Easter

721
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Culture

722
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,344
And then. Hijack

723
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
Bayou

724
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
One guy of failed artist

725
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
And they turned it into a what

726
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
Turns it into a

727
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Just goes to show you

728
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,888
Got me somebody notices it that's a good piece of criticism because obviously

729
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,424
Do you want to say

730
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
Yeah

731
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:58,592
What is this look like what does this remind you of anything these days particularly abstract logo designers

732
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
Have the same problem

733
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
Combat

734
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,408
People coming over

735
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
Names

736
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
Products

737
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
You know where

738
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
It's not

739
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
Good names

740
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,856
Taking all the good URLs are taken and frijole all the good

741
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Simple

742
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,672
Abstract geometric

743
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
Logos are taken

744
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,512
It's really hard to find one that hasn't been

745
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
McDonald ready

746
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
When you do the same

747
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Things you have to do this

748
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
Illegal searches

749
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
How to make sure the

750
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Houses used it

751
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,448
You can find one that's Tyson

752
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,216
Simple

753
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Is a bail bond

754
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
Do you feel like you've discovered

755
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Continental

756
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
Oh my God

757
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,408
Want to buy a gun

758
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Wendy Clarice

759
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
Sharing

760
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,552
Have you ever

761
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,880
Seen a new logo redesign logo

762
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
And

763
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,232
Overtime had the most change of heart about it like a

764
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,280
Strong reaction and then cut

765
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:55,680
Begin to love it or do you remember anything like that where your point of view changed either for the more positive or for the more negative

766
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,984
Partly because of the way I've been

767
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
Trained and

768
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,056
Having done this for so many years

769
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,896
My snap judgment about logos is probably more refined

770
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,736
I should be so they're ones that I saw when they're brand new that I didn't like much

771
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,880
And I still don't like even if I don't like it I sort of get what they were going for

772
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,184
There's some better chest out right I just

773
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,464
Plane don't

774
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
White

775
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
You here in New York

776
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
We had a

777
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,120
The long-standing logo of the Metropolitan Museum of Art

778
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
Was replaced with

779
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
With a logo

780
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
That

781
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
Replace a

782
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,240
A drawing of an atom with

783
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
Sweaters

784
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,544
With water saying the mat

785
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
And a lot of

786
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
Why can partly be

787
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
Replacing something

788
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
They're used to

789
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,992
And partly because I I would concede it was like really

790
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
Really idiocy

791
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
Democratic and weird

792
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:49,440
But the same time I was thinking out but if you go to the mat there was a big complicated idiosyncratic

793
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,232
Place you go there and get lost

794
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,256
It's like really

795
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
Labyrinthian

796
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,096
Inside it has so much stuff there

797
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,912
Please try to represent this thing with something that could

798
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
Look like it was for

799
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Baby doing at Justice

800
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
I need some

801
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,568
It kind of feels

802
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,384
Complicated and idiosyncratic

803
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
Perkins Pacific

804
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,456
So I remember I looked at in the ICU

805
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
Even now when I see it it's still kind

806
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
Taste me back some

807
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
I was used to the old

808
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,392
But I can recognize that in the long run I think

809
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,928
Get well if they stick with it ice

810
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
It'll work

811
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
B

812
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
His beloved as

813
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Its predecessor

814
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
When you say

815
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
That you plain don't like something

816
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,912
Just like in general

817
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,520
What are those things that you play Don't Like It Is there a way you could articulate

818
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
Those qualities

819
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:41,408
I mean I hate to say it but just like everyone else I'll look at something and say

820
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
Oh my goodness that's

821
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
Rather ugly isn't it

822
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:50,112
You know in like you know I mean something like I mean for rent since we want to talk about another another design

823
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,928
The design for the

824
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,208
2012 Olympic

825
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
Rex Ryan London

826
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,560
Widely criticized and I think right

827
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:02,144
It's right to criticize logos I can really cyp

828
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
People criticized because I think that that was like

829
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
Adan

830
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Funny looking

831
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:17,248
It's like no like a presidential campaign logo it's sort of own it it had the mark

832
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:21,088
Moment in time it wasn't designed to be this enduring thing that would last forever

833
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,160
It just had to kind of like symbolize what was happening

834
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
In a specific place

835
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
Pacific time

836
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,048
And would be further associated with all these kind of

837
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,864
Feats of athleticism that would be the last

838
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
Real experience of

839
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
Just woke

840
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,240
And so when away

841
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
Idiosyncratic

842
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Pacific

843
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,640
Come to stand for all those other things however I still think

844
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,504
I just like just like ugly it's a Ramon gainly it's like weird looking

845
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,064
I couldn't I could never quite I have to admit

846
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,368
I personally and privately need

847
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,648
To make up a story that

848
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
Wayne said

849
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:59,744
Sounds like a lot of stories for the metal although I can make a lot of stories

850
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,536
Barbie logo I've ever designed

851
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,608
To me it's sort of the same pleasure I used to take as

852
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
A kid

853
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,680
You know sitting on my dentist office

854
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,728
Just looking at Highlights magazine they have that

855
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
Call hidden pictures

856
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:17,152
In the picture above

857
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,688
Can you find you know

858
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
A teapot

859
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
A hairbrush

860
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,320
Yo a basketball and then and then you can see any of those

861
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,856
Is nuc oh my God

862
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,904
Quite the hairbrush is

863
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,488
The drapes on that window and the basketball is

864
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:35,840
That plate that's in the pantry and then all the sudden you're finding all these things in there such

865
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
Weather in discovering those things

866
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,192
And if you got a logo that has that bit of

867
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,752
Pleasure embedded in it and I think with black friends

868
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,592
Since when we embedded the tan in the eye in the gene that they in the Big Ten logo

869
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,408
We were trying to do something like that the most famous sense

870
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
Probably within

871
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
Temporary logos

872
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Does the arrow that

873
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,760
What's hidden in the FedEx

874
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,624
You know but I think of you know those also promo catalog on sale all those luggage

875
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
Pictures are meant to symbolize

876
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
Connection that's not quite as

877
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,208
His phone is finding a

878
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,744
Airbrushing

879
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,536
Window curtain

880
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,560
Spotted saw

881
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
Something

882
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
It works for me

883
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
These many years later

884
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,984
So last year there was a redesign of

885
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,032
What's the Kodak logo and I interviewed

886
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
Keira Alexandra

887
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,848
Work order who did it

888
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,920
And when I talked to her she purposely talked about how

889
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:26,272
They just pulled it out kind of low-key and they didn't make a big

890
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:31,136
I'll believe about it I mean still got criticized in different ways and largely lauded

891
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
But

892
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,720
You know it was kind of a reaction to the

893
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,792
Brand new thumbs up thumbs down

894
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,352
You know what what do you think of that is that a

895
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:45,728
Good idea. Do you also do feel similarly inclined or do you like to throw it out there

896
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,776
And have it be a bit of a Bloods

897
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,080
You know like what would its what is your take on that

898
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,640
Well I used to

899
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
Tell Mike

900
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,224
Clients no one will care when your logo goes out

901
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
There don't take out an ad in the

902
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:04,416
Bold New Look same Great Taste and I wish you know like no one cares you know

903
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
Honey honey kids come in your nose

904
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,072
Amalgamated widget just change their logo you know no one cares

905
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:16,704
Then we pass through this weird thing where became this funny kind of like social media and Abel

906
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,496
Bloodsport where like in

907
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:25,152
You know amalgamating Wizards can change its logo in 3 2 1 game on you know and it's like 10 on my 4-year

908
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,688
Girl could do that how much they pay for this piece

909
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,760
It turned it is like thing that people didn't

910
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,808
The throne and others amusement

911
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,880
I still think though that these things

912
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:38,464
Succeed to the degree that they are actually reflecting

913
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,304
So something of substance is really changed in the thing that's represented by the

914
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,096
The case of Kodak

915
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,424
When they updated that logo it was meant

916
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
2

917
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
Mark

918
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
The

919
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,032
Rebirth of a beloved

920
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,080
American company that too

921
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,920
Certain generations of photographers really was

922
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
The gold standard of

923
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,344
Adjusted ubiquitous kind of element

924
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
The photographic

925
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
Process

926
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
Associated with

927
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696
Five-letter word Kodak

928
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,792
Especially with the yellow box and with that very simple logo.

929
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
They have

930
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
And when

931
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,144
Alexander and her team updated at

932
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,752
They asked you were really careful I thought insensitive to extrapolating every

933
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
I think they were doing

934
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
From

935
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
Examples

936
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
Past and I know

937
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,384
Pleasure she took

938
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,200
She did one big bold move which was

939
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
Instead of writing Kodak

940
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,272
Horizontally Shiraz

941
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,320
Vertically she Stacks the five letters

942
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
I want to talk to each other

943
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,416
Stand is able to make a kind of ready for it

944
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,720
The 21st century and all the requirements

945
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
Logos half

946
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,024
They have today in

947
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Reproduction

948
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,840
Dissemination

949
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,656
She made a really nice logo with that move and

950
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,960
Rachel pleasure in finding

951
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
A couple of examples of

952
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,800
The weather is being stacked in the

953
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,824
The same way

954
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
From deep in the past

955
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,616
Summit companies

956
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,664
She was able to kind of give the whole thing this

957
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,688
Imprimatur

958
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
Endorsement

959
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,224
From

960
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
Almost beyond the grave from

961
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
The deep in the history

962
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,808
The company which I think

963
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
Satisfying and icy very effect

964
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
Is there a God

965
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,184
Fashion

966
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,208
Right now

967
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,512
That you wrestle again

968
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,608
Or or maybe one that you think is right me like simple for example is

969
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,424
I don't think it's I think it's cuz I'm always been

970
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,216
Somewhat of a goal and logos but

971
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,496
It seems

972
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
A real

973
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,336
Guiding principle right now maybe more than

974
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,896
In the time when somebody wrote a Coca-Cola

975
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
How is a long

976
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
Script

977
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,456
Is there something

978
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
Here today that

979
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,576
You really love that you think is is a fundamental principle or do you think

980
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,624
What is a fashion or anything like that

981
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,184
I have two men I like Simplicity of

982
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,976
Form but I kind of

983
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:51,328
Some of them so little suspicious of Simplicity and typography

984
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,424
You know so I love this typeface called helvetica which some people would argue is Hmong

985
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,264
Now it's a very simple clean and ubiquitous typeface that off

986
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
And all that has

987
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,848
This represented over the years everything

988
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
American Apparel

989
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,408
American Airlines

990
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,712
Chances are no matter where you are

991
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,088
On something that you can see from where you're sitting and if not

992
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
Just take out

993
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
Your wallet and

994
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
Ebony America

995
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
Currency

996
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,208
That big number 5 on

997
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,232
Your $5 bill is

998
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
And I think

999
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,632
There was a time back in the White City

1000
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:29,984
States where you can take any logo resetting El vaticano look modern contemporary in

1001
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,776
Mike ready for

1002
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,800
You know the millennium

1003
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:37,664
And I think I'm going to throw out of favor and I think I'll be his comeback a lil

1004
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
Little bit song

1005
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,992
Among other things

1006
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,320
In a very recently Diane Von Furstenberg has been redesigned so in

1007
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,344
Instead all by

1008
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,904
Friday DVD

1009
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
Dvf

1010
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
Monogram

1011
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,048
Dog that's what they had before now it's two words Diane by

1012

Firstmark login

1013
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:59,936
And it looks clean it looks neutral looks smart but it also kind of

1014
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,472
At its worst

1015
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,776
You know you're not not answering this case but I mean

1016
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,080
Sort of has that same sort of

1017
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,616
Guam and

1018
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,152
Impassive

1019
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:09,920
Band

1020
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,200
Kind of

1021
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,040
I am really I'm too cool even to acknowledge you exist

1022
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:21,440
How to face that supermodels will have in certain fashion shoes for they just are expressionless and kind of almost zombie like in

1023
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
I am so cool download

1024
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,816
Camino please look at me not like that I don't know who you are

1025
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,352
Go away you know

1026
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:34,240
And some have that quality and I just answered you can be a mean withholding sword

1027
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:38,848
So I have a bunch of listeners there be no design aware their design engaged

1028
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,480
And as a person who knew puts things out in the world and and mixed logos and makes new

1029
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,784
Logo systems for people

1030
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,856
What would you want them to know when they interact with you

1031
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,904
Like what what type of criticism

1032
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Would you

1033
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,232
Like to hear or not like to hear

1034
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,840
Ice or do you want to field we're like almost like a lot of the things that

1035
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
Define

1036
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
When I do

1037
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,704
Comes down to really boring sort of

1038
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
Sayings

1039
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,800
It's like don't judge a book by its cover

1040
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,616
Or on the other hand you only get one chance to make a first time

1041
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
Compression

1042
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,736
Until they all kind of contradict each other you know and you know

1043
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,296
The advice I give is that on

1044
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,344
At the end of the day

1045
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,392
Graphic design is

1046
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
Really important

1047
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
But it's also kind of

1048
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:35,168
One of those cosmetic things in the world to know if you can read an exit sign you're going to get out the door you know

1049
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,728
If a door has no door knob on it with snails

1050
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,032
Close in all these are all things that are real and Padme

1051
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,592
It's what that exit sign can be in any type face you want

1052
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,872
I'm still going to find the door

1053
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:50,528
And so I think it's some now you can make a handsome exit sign that actually fits the architecture around that you can make one

1054
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,320
One that's hard to read

1055
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,880
And that one is going to be dysfunctional

1056
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:58,464
But there's a lot of different ways to do it and usually it's not a life-or-death thing

1057
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,608
I think there's a lot of things that are like really life-and-death matters in the world and really important are worth getting agitated about

1058
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,424
I think that probably logo design

1059
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,216
Shouldn't be one of them

1060
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
There's people that are paid alot of money to

1061
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,080
TUC care desperately about the way logos look and

1062
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,152
I aspire to be one of those people I think that

1063
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,480
If your not getting paid to do it's like trying not to

1064
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,576
To do it too much only do degree it entertains you but then move on to more important

1065
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,440
Michael bierut is a partner at pentagram

1066

1067
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,864

1068
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144

It's really good

1074
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,152
You're looking for insights into the world of design

Design matter

1079
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,832

Which is a clip of a live event I do with my friend Kevin smokler

1084
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,936
About the places

1085
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
Both real and imagined

1086

He's moving on to do his very own project

1109
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,999
We're all really excited about

1110
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,303
It's too soon to tell you anything about it yet

1111
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,351
But I want you to remember this word

1112
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,631

Inertia

1121
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,647
We are brothers 91.7 kalw in San Francisco and produce

1122
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Radio row

1123
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
And beautiful

1124
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
Downtown

1125
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
Oakland California

1126
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,911
So few weeks ago I had a conversation in front of a live audience at

1127
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,191
Spur in Oakland

1128
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:51,775
With my pal Kevin smokler about his book Brat Pack America

1129
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:57,919
Which is this like 300 Page Love Letter to all the places where your favorite 80s teen movies were sad

1130
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:04,319
I really enjoyed the book and our conversation but after I record it I learned that if you aren't as well versed in the 80s movies

1131
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,623
Genre as I am you might get a little lost

1132
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:13,023
End the conversation just worked way better on the website we could have bed all the pictures of places that were talking about in the trailers from the movie along with

1133
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
The audio of the event

1134
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,631
Is where the coolest web features we've ever done so I hope you check it out

1135
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,911
Here's a little clip

1136
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,935
Quora conversation

1137
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:25,055
Locations in Ferris Bueller all within the downtown Loop and Wrigley Field

1138
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,871
I mean that's one thing that struck me I watch Ferris Bueller again

1139
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
A couple nights ago

1140
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
And

1141
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
Havoline

1142
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,831
Sense of Chicago

1143
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:41,695
It's really thirsty like they're not they're not there because they really know Chicago

1144
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
There there

1145
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,767
Doing the exact same things that

1146
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,839
A literal field trip from school would take them to

1147
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,631
Yeah I need the

1148
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:56,031
For kids who live like 3 train stops away from Chicago that they act like they're there from Cody Wyoming

1149
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:02,431
For something like a slice of deep dish pizza like they've complete

1150
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
Day of twisting around

1151
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,783
Chicago

1152
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,111
To be fair and this is only very slightly so

1153
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,671
John Hughes was a White Sox

1154
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:19,071
Not a Cubs fan and so he wanted to shoot the Wrigley Field seen at Comiskey Park which would have at least taken them to the south side of from

1155
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:23,423
But the socks were not in town

1156
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,727
That that weekend until they had to fill my

1157
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:34,175
I barely feel so yeah it is it's a really like not adventurous day off and the funny thing is John Cusack

1158
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:38,015
Simself even though he was very aware of himself as a dweller in the

1159
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
North suburbs

1160
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
In Chicago

1161
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,415
Well heck all over the place like I put a lot of time with one of his kids

1162
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,719
And John Hughes wrote everything down

1163
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,559
And used to use the write down like all the concerts you would go to any art exhibits you would go to

1164
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,327
Is a teenager

1165
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,399
The guy the guy mapped all of Chicago on foot

1166
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,703
And somehow we get this very

1167
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,751
Myopic parochial picture

1168
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Chicagoland

1169
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
Can ferrets

1170
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,895
Do the full interview trailers pics and links to Kevin's book

1171
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,199
Brat Pack America on our website

1172
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,479

. org

1174
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,135
Between the beats

1175
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
Bongs and chatter of our devices

1176
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:21,023
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

1177
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
If

1178
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:28,447
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

1179
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:32,543
All hearing. Voice

Technology

1181
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
Talk to us

1182
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,383
It is a creation of Sonic trash

1183
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,455
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

1184
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:43,039
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

1185
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,831
To make them more human

1186
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,927
Turn the living room lights on

1187
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,719
Okay

1188
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,279
Dim the living room lights to 50%

1189
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
Okay

1190
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,471
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

1191
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,775
Makes for a much more natural

1192
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
Experience

1193
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
Turn the living room lights on

1194
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,663
Dim the living room lights

1195
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,687

Series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

1224

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

1229
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,335
What is a ton of weight

Play a prisoner or a psychopath

Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

1232
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,343
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

1233
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,391
Actually if I'm being honest

1234
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,695
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of

1235
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:37,119
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

1236
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,447
Was found dead in my private gym

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

1238
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:48,127
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

1239
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,151
Now

1240
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,455
I need to clear my name

1241
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:56,831
