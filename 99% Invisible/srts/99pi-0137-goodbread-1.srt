This is 99% invisible

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,400
Wonder Bread

27
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm Roman Mars

28
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,032
When I think about white bread

29
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
I usually think of Wonder Bread

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,688
And I can picture the Lowe's all lined up on the grocery store shelves in perfect

31
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,968
Cornrows

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,320
The red yellow and blue circles on the Wonder Bread label

33
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
We're supposed to conjure balloons

34
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
Floating away

35
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
Taking us somewhere

36
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,464
Somewhere one dress

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
Somewhere

38
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
Better

39
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:41,120
The first print advertisement for Wonder Bread which actually came out before the bread itself

40
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
Stated only that a Wonder was coming

41
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,240
That's Wonderboy Sam Greenspan

42
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,032
In The Runaways and it's time

43
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,824
Wonder Bread Billy was a Wonder

44
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,616
It was the perfect loaf

45
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:57,248
But now white bread and I just wonder bread but really any brand of industrially produced white bread

46
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
It started by food purists as part of the

47
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Problem

48
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,720
The problem being that we don't know where our food comes from and we might be consuming in pure and unhealthy ingredients

49
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
The funny thing is

50
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,816
Industrial white bread that evenly sliced

51
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,632
Squishy moist perfectly white and wondrous loaf

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
Was once the highly design solution

53
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,472
Do that very same problem

54
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,056
You want to go bigger and stronger don't you

55
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:27,456
A sandwich Deli in 2 slices of Wonder Bread every meal give you eight elements you need

56
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
For much of human history has been

57
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,648
One of the most important foods

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,464
Our human ancestors 30000 years ago

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
Had a crude form of bread

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,304
Nearly every culture on Earth has some form of bread

61
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,864
Any importance of bread is shall we say

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Baked into language

63
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,288
Take for instance the word companion if we take the word companion back to its Latin roots

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
We can't calm which is with and

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Han

66
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
Which is bread

67
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,808
A companion is someone that you sit down and you you break bread with

68
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,696
He's the author of the book white bread a social history of the store-bought loaf

69
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
It is

70
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,280
Aaron also talks about the word Lord

71
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
It comes from a word in Old English

72
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,912
I'm not sure how to pronounce it exactly but I'm paper it looks like last word

73
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
HLA Ford

74
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
Holford

75
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,800
Flyboard and that men's

76
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,872
The keeper of bread or the person who gives bread

77
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
And that's

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
Striking because it

79
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,760
It tells us the very Act of political rule

80
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808
Was rapped

81
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
Stop in the bread Supply

82
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,416
Plus think of all the ways that bread comes up culturally

83
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,512
Catholics believe that the communion bread transubstantiation into the body of Christ

84
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,608
There's Lord's Prayer Matthew 6:11 give us today our daily bread

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,192
The Jewish holiday Passover centers around the preparation of bread

86
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
And on and on

87
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,384
In the Middle Ages most people got something like 80% of their calories from Bratz

88
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,968
Fast forward on Millennium or so in the late 19th century

89
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,040
People are still getting about 30% of their calories from bread

90
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,904
That's so much bread that's breaded every meal and some meals that were only bread

91
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
For most of our long history with bread

92
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,024
Bb8 was made in our homes

93
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
Eventually we had small bakery is that

94
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
Buy bread for more people

95
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
But they weren't exactly a picture of artisanal

96
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:28,031
Purity and often Underground

97
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
Usually with terrible working conditions

98
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
You never knew when the baker would cut costs by cutting the dough with sawdust or some other horrible additives

99
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,087
During the time we're talking about the late eighteen hundreds early nineteen hundreds

100
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,391
There was a lot of foodborne illness

101
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
Colorado typhus

102
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,255
A lot of Americans were starting to fear their food

103
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
And for good reason

104
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
You were food

105
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
Could kill you

106
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Middle and upper-class

107
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
White

108
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
Native-born Americans

109
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
Period go through this

110
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
Kind of freaked out

111
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
About

112
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
Safety

113
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Beer bread

114
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,919
And you see newspaper headlines

115
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
During this time screaming

116
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Things like that

117
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,647
And and people were really freaked out

118
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,207
Every city was holding major

119
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
Earrings on

120
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
On the bread question

121
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
The neighborhood Bakery

122
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
Pretty that we romanticize

123
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Today

124
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
Was the Specter of

125
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
Fear and Terror

126
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,775
Until people started getting really interested in where their food came from

127
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,591
Kind of like people are doing right now

128
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,175
Knowing where their food came from mint actively avoiding

129
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Locally baked bread

130
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,247
Factory bread the thinking went

131
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,831
Was born not of unclean hands in an underground furnace

132
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
Put in a modern light-filled

133
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Palace of Industry

134
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
These palaces of Industry with

135
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
Supply bread to the masses

136
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
And it spread

137
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
Woody White

138
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
Bread is a delicious food

139
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,959
Its flavor blends perfectly with other food

140
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:09,919
White flour and white bread aren't recent technological innovations in and of themselves they've been around for millennia

141
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,063
Technically speaking white flour is whole wheat flour with the bran and The Germ from the wheat kernel sitting out

142
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,391
Industrial Bakers choice white bread as their Flagship bread

143
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
White was a marker of purity

144
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
And cleanliness

145
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,351
And if this sediment sounds vaguely racist you well the racism

146
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
More than that

147
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
Dr. Woods Hutch

148
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,471
Noted Health columnist

149
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,799
I'm in a new syndicated columnist in newspaper

150
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
Argued that

151
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
Only white bread

152
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Which fortify

153
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
The white race

154
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,455
To do the things that had to do and go out in

155
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Conquer other

156
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,807
And if that's not revolting enough food reformers of the day

157
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,879
I'm referring to the weight loss as a Chase

158
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Loaf

159
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
And the dark Leviathan

160
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
Filed

161
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,303
A real Vector for a Contagion

162
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,863
That was mostly the meat and dairy Supply

163
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,471
Which is why Aaron bobrow strain argues that this fear over the safety of bread

164
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
Wasn't actually about bread

165
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
What I started to realize was

166
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
That is heavy

167
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Become

168
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
Impossible in

169
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
And native-born middle and upper-class whites

170
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Mine

171
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,575
Separate spheres about bread safety

172
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
From there

173
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
Fears about

174
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
Particularly The New Southern and

175
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
Eastern European immigrants

176
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,327
Who's supposedly dirty and

177
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,351
Diseased

178
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
Hands we're touching bread

179
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:41,055
In neighborhood Bakery basically Aaron believes that our attraction to white bread came from real fears about food contagious

180
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
They got mixed up unfairly with

181
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
Fears about immigrants

182
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
It was a shining White

183
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Clean

184
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
Modern Marvels

185
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
Untouched by human hands

186
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,647
That was the antithesis of that scary supposed to be dirty and disease

187
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
Product of immigration

188
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,839
You knew it was free of dirt and other contaminants

189
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
Which you might fear from your local bakery

190
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,703
Whiteness was us in proof of purity

191
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
That logic is kind of flood because

192
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
Lots of the adulterants

193
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Chalk

194
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
Alan the bleach white love just needed one more thing before I could fully and body are need for you

195
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
It needed

196
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
To be sliced

197
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,367
Which brings us to a summer day

198
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
In 1928

199
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Let's say

200
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
July 7-9

201
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
28

202
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,535
On that day it was July 7th I checked

203
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,631
In the town of Chillicothe Missouri people have gathered at 1st and Elm Street

204
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
Treats and they were lined up around

205
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,823
On the Block I don't know if their lines down the block those weren't describe but but people were certainly eager to see this however they were

206
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Gathered

207
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
People were there to witness the

208
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
The Advent of

209
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Packaged

210
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
Pre sliced bread

211
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
When reporter in Chillicothe Missouri

212
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Spoke of

213
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:59,135
Housewives who were visiting this Bakery to see the slice bread how they had

214
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
To relive enthusiasm

215
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:06,559
Awestruck by this perfectly sliced bread it was a small edible

216
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
Vision of progress

217
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
And the future

218
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,775
People like sliced bread so much I can't overstate how much they loved it and how quickly it caught on was the best thing

219
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,383
Another thing that was good

220
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
Industrial Baker's had the hype

221
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
They had the sense of moral mission

222
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
And they had the design parameters

223
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
White bread in streamline loves

224
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
With the uniform slices

225
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,231
But the science of industrializing and

226
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Mass producing bread

227
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
Was still a little wacky

228
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
Bread after all

229
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,399
Is the product of microorganisms going through biological

230
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Prophecies

231
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,263
When is a function of time and temperature and a lot of other variables

232
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,079
That was one of the last major Foods

233
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
How to get Industrial

234
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Precisely

235
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,175
Because of how complex it is to make

236
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
Uniformly

237
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
The assembly process was

238
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
Really different than say

239
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Making a car

240
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
Imagine if Henry Ford

241
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,391
Every time he wanted to make a

242
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,695
Car had to worry about the fact that

243
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,511
Is Parts might grow or Shrink the

244
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,839
Depending on the temperature and humidity that day

245
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,423
Bad a gust of air coming through the factory might cause his

246
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
Cardiff

247
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,263
These are the kind of biological

248
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,567
Questions that early industrial Baker

249
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Had to figure out

250
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,687
And so from the 1920s and 30s on Word

251
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
Industrial baker's rack

252
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Constantly tinkering

253
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
What the design of white bread

254
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
They cut the time it took

255
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,111
For the bread to rise by adding sugar

256
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
The temperature

257
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
The Anamosa fire

258
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
To allow those water in

259
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
Fatted mixed together better

260
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
Getting white bread its height

261
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,303
And more even grain

262
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
That also got rid of owls

263
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,239
Because wondersoft with Bread is made from bat or not go it has no holes under soft whip

264
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:56,639
Eventually vitamins were added and sold to the public as a means of making Hardy young men would be fit to fight in the

265
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:02,783
Do slices of Wonder Bread every meal give you as much phosphorus for cell metabolism

266
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,367
As much iron for red blood as free Lamb Chop

267
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:12,511
As much niacin for mental health at 6 sardines as much energy has two glasses of milk

268
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Little by little

269
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,839
Terry's factories created their own recipe

270
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
Innovations for industrial white bread

271
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,471
And all of that came to a head in 1952

272
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
In Rockford Illinois

273
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
The USDA

274
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
In

275
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
Cooperation with

276
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,223
Key figures of the industrial baking world put together a a multi-year project

277
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
That I kind of

278
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,319
Jokingly referred to as the Manhattan Project of bread

279
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,695
The multi-year panoramic investigation of bread and bread eating habits

280
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,511
And the ultimate goal of the project

281
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,839
West you design the perfect loaf of white bread

282
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,167
Involves focus groups market research

283
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
Double blind taste test

284
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,287
The end product of the so-called Manhattan Project of bread

285
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
Was a white bread two and a half

286
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
Times as sweet as the average loaf available at the

287
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
The time

288
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
40% fluffy

289
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Fear 2

290
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,623
The fluffier the manufacturers made the bread the more people wanted to buy it even though the Rockford research

291
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,183
Also showed that they didn't really like it

292
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,231
He just couldn't resist the fluff

293
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
Consumers are

294
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,327
Choosing the fluffier bread but not

295
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
Secretly liking its text

296
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,447
But yet they were eating it in large quantities

297
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
He's about a pound and a half per person per week

298
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,823
Not too long after the Rockford City closes shop

299
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,383
White bread goes through an identity crisis

300
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
Where was once a

301
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
Fielded symbol of progress

302
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
White bread began to get used as an epithet

303
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:43,647
Meaning of Stuffy conservative Square white Suburban in 1970 when Richard Pryor

304
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,303
Enough it storms off the stage of his popular show at the Aladdin Theater in Las Vegas saying

305
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
He's absolutely done

306
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
Which is white bread humor

307
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
From that point forward

308
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
Counterculture movement

309
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,007
Used white bread as an emblem of the established

310
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
The silent majority

311
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
Richard Nixon's America

312
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,663
The band by the 1980s

313
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
1990s

314
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,759
The meaning starts to bifurcate

315
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
It also starts to take on

316
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,135
The significance of white trash

317
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
I'm so white bread starts to

318
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
Stand in for

319
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
Poor white person

320
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,607

321
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399

323
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
Essentially the opposite of it

South Suburban and rural

Debate over which

327
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Kind of bread to eat

328
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
White or wheat

329
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
It's not new

330
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
Thousands of years

331
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
In Plato's Republic

332
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,439
Play-Doh sets up this kind of

333
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Debate

334
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,255
About weather

335
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
The ideal Palace

336
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
The ideal Society or city state

337
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Should

338
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
Function on a diet of

Soul drain gruel

Bread cake

344
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,455
But what's most interesting about these days in history

345
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,503
Isn't there often about everything

346
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Except bread

347
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,623
Even back then it was really not about

348
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,207
The healthiness of bread so much as it was about

349
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
Anxieties about weather

350
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,887

Receive that

352
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
Debates about white bread and brown bread get tied up into large questions about what do people think about

353
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,151
Progress what do people think about industrialization

354
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431

356
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,807
About whether or not we keep white bread or brown bread

357
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,367
It's usually about much larger questions

358
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
We can learn

359
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,791
Something about her our own Society our own anxieties and aspirations by looking at first debates about what counts as

00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
If

374
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:11,007
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

375
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Technology

376
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
She talked to us

377
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,943
It is a creation of Sonic trash

Okay

386
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,031
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

387
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,335
Makes for a much more natural

Even worse

429
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,231
The cops think that I had something to do with it

430
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
Now

431
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
