Inactivity and diversity

36
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,720
Go to any City and it's pretty clear a place can be the first

37
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,512
Without really being injured

38
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,608

And the three of us

45
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,088
I'm working on this project for number years called the Arsenal of exclusion and inclusion

46
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,184
This Arsenal is a catalog of stuff inside a city will be called weapons

00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,000

That architects-planners policymakers developers Etc used either bring people together or keep people apart

52
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
Open the city or closed

53
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,312
City or increase access to space to restrict people's access

Weapons ranging from

57
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
No loitering signs

58
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,064
Two big things like housing vouchers and it

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
Exclusionary zoning

60
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
And all that kind of

61
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,440
Today we're only going to focus on the Arsenal of Acts

62
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
The weapons that

63
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
People apart

64
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Arsenal

65
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,608
In the city of Baltimore a place Daniel yoga truly loves

66

Maryland Institute College of Art

67
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
So I have a

68
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
A strong connection with

69
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
Baltimore

70
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
It's dog

71
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
A city that I

72
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
Love and admire very much

73
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,384
It's a wonderful place

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,456
But it's a city that has been honing its arsenal of exclusion

75
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
For decades

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,064
Baltimore was once to be invisible while building industry with Detroit was

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
To the automotive industry

78
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
Innovative Workshop

79
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:44,000
Creative minds work to think up and vent test out and ultimately export methods of it

80
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
Conclusion

00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,424
Are producer and resin baltimorean Sam Greenspan went to look at some of charm cities exclusive offering

82
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
Before we go

83
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Where we going to go and what we're doing

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
How to get there

85
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Give me a second

86
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,952
Dandy yoga and I are driving north on Greenmount Avenue in East Baltimore

87
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,815
I can't think of Green Mountain North 33rd to Cold Spring

88
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:25,215
As a kind of Museum of of exclusion on Greenmount Avenue North of 30

89
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,055
It's clear that Greenmount Avenue is a dividing line but

90
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,151
Between rich and poor and black and white but what's not immediately obvious

91
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Is why

92
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
Just to give you a sense

93
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
As we drive north on Greenmount to our right

94
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,927
Eastside is Waverly Waverly is lower-income and around 80%

95
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
16% of a bachelor's degree

96
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,815
Median income is $40,000 and on the other side

97
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
On the west side or left

98
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,655
What is oakenshaw and then Guildford

99
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
Well to the north of that

100
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,751
A really aswan area buffered by a middle-income

101
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
Only about seven percent

102
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,175
Can 75% have a bachelor's degree in the median income is $75,000

103
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,575
And then you'll be okay as view it's not the wide Greenmount Avenue that keeps these neighborhoods apart

104
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Total and invisible

105
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
Get totally intentional

106
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,183
The teepees neighborhood sepehr

107
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,999
Demographically The Divide is very strict

108
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,839
And severe you can just see all these physical measures that

109
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
Deployed

110
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
To keep people from getting from one side

111
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,727
To the other Crossing Greenmount on foot is annoying

112
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:35,615
To crosswalks in that 1.25 Mile Stretch but what's more interesting is when we talk about the grid

113
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
Greenmount is where the grid end

114
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,991
The grid is there in Waverly on the east side

115
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
Notice that on the right

116
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,623
There's the grid is 37th Street 38th Street

117
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:53,023
We can make a right into Waverly no problem but on our left there's no grit right it stops to notice we're heading North now

118
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
If we try to make a left we're going to be confronted with

119
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,887
Dead End Street Ballard

120
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:02,751
If they're like these security poles that you can stick in the ground

121
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,615
Oh here's a wall right there's this long row of middle-income houses on the Westside

122
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,663
What kind of a buffer against the

123
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
Really wealthy Guildford stuff

124
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Just behind

125
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,599
Almost all of the roads dead and the houses and the few street that do go through

126
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,415
Are mostly one-way streets coming the opposite direction

127
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Outon

128
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,231
Greenmount is no way for us to

129
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
Baguette

130
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,815
Left into open shop or Guilford

131
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,631
There has to be some way to get into the neighborhood

132
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:35,263
Well there is but on Guilford Eastside you really have to go out of your way to find a street that will let you in

133
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
Tomorrow in Guilford finally

134
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
And then once you're inside you'll notice two things

135
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
The houses are super nice

136
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,223
And the roads are super weird

137
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
The roads are winding

138
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
And they feel disproportionately small

139
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,391
Next to these houses giant lawn and you need a permit to park

140
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
Another interesting

141
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
Residential parking permit

142
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Residential parking

143
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,071
Case you're wondering you do not need a permit

144
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
Spark in the less affluent Waverly neighborhood

145
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,727
But back to Guilford the weirdest thing about these roads is that it's hard to know what direction

146
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,799
And could you tell if you snore

147
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:14,687
Westar South Philly how to tell right I would imagine we're actually going east

148
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
Greenmount Avenue

149
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,903
Super Outsiders and we don't know our way around Guilford we were shunted out of the neighborhood on a one-way Street

150
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,207
Greenmount Avenue

151
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,815
This is one of the one-way streets heading out of the neighborhood I got shall we really

152
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,423
Y'all got out back to remount and I thought we were going through it

153
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,823
These physical barriers in the Arsenal of exclusion grids and one-way streets are not that big a deal they're not that

154
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
Hard to overcome

155
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:47,199
But their placement has meaning because really matter that you can make a left turn into

156
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,503
Guilford wood would this be a more Equitable City

157
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
If we could make that left turn

158
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
Probably not right away

159
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
Is Morrison boxing

160
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,647
Right at this place where this demographic

161
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Divided dish

162
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
Just rendered very

163
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Physically in space

164
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:04,863
But it's worth noting that other weapons in the Arsenal of exclusion that once existed here in Guilford are now it illegal

165
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:10,495
Like restrictive housing Covenants

166
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
Restrictive housing Covenant

167
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,383
Tioga says that this neighborhood actually pioneered the use of segregation is covenant

168
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
Housing Deeds that restricted occupancy

169
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
Do only white

170
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,807
This wasn't illegal until 1968

171
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,463
You can point these Guerrilla street is being an emblem of the racial segregation that still exist in Baltimore

172
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,095
What is interesting to speculate what the neighborhood would be like if he's exclusionary measures warrant in place

173
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,655
Neighborhood been built on a grid

174
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,495
Upper middle class white people living here probably would have flooded the suburbs

175
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,799
In the seventies eighties right

176
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
Given that there are

177
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
Rich white people

178
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,455
Still living here within the city limits paying

179
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,735
City taxes

180
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,807
Is it worse than just having all the rich white people live in

181
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
Adams County

182
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:02,463
It's a really good question then the trick is to try to develop neighborhood

183
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
That's not a zero-sum game

184
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
Where one party loses in

185
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
Another party game

186
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,399
And that is interboro Partners next project

187
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,727
Green development solutions that are not zero-sum games

188
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:18,335
It all starts with labeling and categorizing the weapons in the Arsenal of exclusion

189
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
And inclusion

190
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
So we can figure out how to create cities that are more open

191
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Everybody

192
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Is linode

193
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,647
Most of the weapons in the Arsenal of exclusion create barriers

194
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,695
They're hard to see because they are subtle

195
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
Nondescript

196
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Except when they're not

197
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
Here's here's the

198
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
The Baltimore City

199
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,775
Daniel cat exams the former side of Hollander Ridge it was a lower income housing project the way out on the city

200
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
County Line

201
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
It has since been torn down but one artifact of the project Remains The Rosedale Community up their Lobby to

202
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,991
8ft tall

203
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Spiked

204
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Wrought iron fence

205
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,855
Around the perimeter of Hollander Ridge

206
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:06,463
Are the separated from their Community with send was predominately white suburban community

207
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,791
It's like a gated community traded from the outside

208
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
The really strange and unfortunate

209
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
I think it's funny

210
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
The spikes are actually pointing

211
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
The other direction

212
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,543
So I guess you could you could go over but you couldn't

213
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Right

214
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:47,167
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Sam Greenspan and me Roman Mars with help from sky

215

244
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567

245

Comic mystery

246
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,175
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

247
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
We're looking the part

248
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
Might cost you your life

249
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:42,367
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

250
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,719
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

251
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,071
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

252
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:55,423
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

253
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,727
Actually if I'm being honest

254
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:04,127
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of thing a few days ago Wesley Stern

255
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,455
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

256
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,783
Was found dead in my private gym

257
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,183
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had some

258
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
Nothing to do with it

259
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
Now

260
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
I need to clear my name

261
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:27,935
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
