I'm Roman Mars

52
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,440
So I was out all last week at the Ted conference, give it talk it went rate

53
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,280
I'll let everyone know when the video was released I just had this amazing time

54
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
But I'm

55
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
Exhausted

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,888
And I need a week off to recuperate so

57
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,960
The episode I want a rebroadcast has an old one but it

58
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,264
And I remembered it

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,384
When was being interviewed on the Ted stage by Helen Walters here's the relevant section of the interview

Prolong time

68
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,792
What is it about us money

69
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,352
So that's what this episode is about my problem

70
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,632
With American money

71
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
It dates back a few years till when the show was

72
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
Just a one-man operation so I hope you like it

73
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,824
Wella heavier the beginning the show I have a couple of business items

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,640
First is that we have a survey that I'd love for you to fill out

75
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
You let us know

76
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:04,064
Howard doing and demographic data about who you are and what podcast do like so it would really help us out

00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,696
Balls have a link on a website it just takes a few minutes

79
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:16,352
I was going to give an extra shot out to some of the musicians who are regulars on 99 Pi Keegan DeWitt NY first discuss

80
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,704
Covered at the composer of the cold weather soundtrack we use it a lot he's brilliant

81
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
Okay akumi and all the artists on Hell audio are fantastic you cannot go wrong with them the folks in abandoned

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,504
Building records in particular I love the band set in sand and we use this song talking to her right now in the credits quite a bit

83
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,344
And everything I say sounds good on top of this song

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,232
And last but certainly not least our pal melodeon who makes music than spires meat on a weekly basis

85
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,072
There are so many more and I'll remind you of them regularly on the website

86
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,472
At the end of the show from time to time they all make great records they're all on bandcamp if you go support great artists like that

87
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,056
You will feel good in the world will be a better place

88
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Thanks

89
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128

This is 99% invisible

91
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
I'm roaming

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
US Paper currency is so ubiquitous

93
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,744
That to really look at its graphic design with

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Foshan

95
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,327
Requires deliberate and focused attention

96
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,143
The paleta Greenback from your wallet

97
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,191
Or look at a picture online if your internet

98
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,263
Just really take it in

99
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
All the fonts

100
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
The busy filigree

101
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
Micro pattern

102
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Just

103
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
Dreadful

104
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
Thermapure design is point of view

105
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
I thought I said that top because it is a little bit subjective

106
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
Piper graphically

107
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Graphically symbolically

108
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,655
If it never been designed before on someone was to submit that as a solution I think they were just going to throw it out

109
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
Critical at this point because

110
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
There are actually

111
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,079
Pretty compelling and understandable reasons for its particular brand of horribleness

112
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:08,991
Tracking the primary tension embodied in the design of the Greenback boils down to how my friend Tom Nelson at the blog humans

113
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Then design

114
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,831
When I handle American money it feels like an artifact

115
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:19,231
Because it's so ornate and it has an old look to it even though paper currency itself just the idea of money as a

116
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
The massive

117
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
World

118
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
Changing technology

119
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,863
The look and feel of us paper money

120
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
Is Barry stagner

121
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,007
It seems like a relic from when I country was founded would you buy a car

122
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,823
Still look like the Model T Ford now you buy

123
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
Latest

124
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Monologue

125
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
But things are evolving

126
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:41,247
Change your time that's Richard Smith contest called the dollar redesign project

127
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,551
It's become a classic like classic

128
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
62

129
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
3 time

130
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,647
I'm sure usage and three familiarity

131
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
Stole Christmas from a design point of view

132
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Kind of been

133
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
Superseded by its

134
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Symbolic

135
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,007
So if you were to start from scratch when we design us paper money

136
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,847
Smith says there are five major areas where we could improve

137
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
Number one is color

138
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,623
The idea of using one color doesn't really tell you much other than that we like the color green are largely monochromatic money

139
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,975
We've introduced a purple 5 and some PT Hughes

140
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,815
But there are a lot of colors and most countries use at least some of them

141
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
Number two is size why they matter

142
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
Casio one size

143
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
Question mark in my head

144
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Never really made

145
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Send price

146
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
Physically I'm philosophically having variable size coin certainly helps us sort them and you could use the same pen

147
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Ansible for build

148
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,527
Which leads us to point number 3 and Smith Manifesto

149
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Functionality

150
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
Some functionality button Ables

151
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
People if I come

152
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
C2

153
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
Clearly distinguish

154
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,487
Waterbury to the fundamental level

155
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
Which note is which

156
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,655
The fact that there's no easy way for the blind to use our currency goes beyond bad design is actually immoral

157
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:09,055
Then the next fundamental thing I saw it was composition s number 4 meaning like was it made from this is a

158
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Who is a little

159
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:15,967
Conceptual into like where this could go but being a just seems that a product design

160
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
I could come in and soda come out

161
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,135
Something really interesting recycled material with a smaller carbon footprint or more durable synthetics that last longer

162
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,975
The very heart of the dollar redesign project is number 5

163
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Symbolism

164
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
Who should go on the bills and why

165
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
Why the founding fathers

166
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
The be-all-and-end-all of everything but is America

167
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
I think somebody that's the

168
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,031
One of the biggest issues if he were to change anything

169
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
I would say that was that would be where I was

170
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Stop

171
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
Could be a platform to celebrate

172
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,711
Thing that is unique special different

173
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
But you didn't know about America

174
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:55,391
And that's the suggestion that can get a British expat on his way to American citizenship like Richard Smith

175
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,183
Colorful hate mail

176
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
But it's an intriguing less than the last

177
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,839
Even if you just view the five suggestions as a philosophical exercise

178
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,143
To assess the current design for all of its strength

179
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,519
It's hard to imagine all those things being modified on US currency

180
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,103
But it's not hard to imagine each of them being implemented somewhere

181
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
In fact most of them are implemented everywhere

182
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Case in point

183
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Australia

184
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,807
On the other side of the world each and every one of these five issues

185
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
Have coincidentally

186
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Ben address

187
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
Let me introduce

188
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
A masterpiece

189
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Australian design

190
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
Australia's new

191
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
$5

192
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
Really proud about money

193
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,007
Absolutely no idea why I'm so proud of it but I really am

194
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
That's Tristan cook

195
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,847
You're about to hear why he's so proud

196
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,175
Tristan and Tom Nelson here from briefly at the top of the show

197
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,759
Are user-centered design your blog

198
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
Call humans in design

199
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
Tristan is Australian Tom is American

200
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
What time went to school in Australia for a couple years

201
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,743
And the money they're made a big impression on them

202
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
The money is plastic

203
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,423
And they're all different sizes and their colorful disconcerting

204
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,823
I'll just look like toy money to be a shock you begin to appreciate all the different design characteristics

205
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
Australian currency

206
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
First

207
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Is the color

208
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,479
$5 is sort of a lavender $10 is

209
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,039
Blue with little bit of a green stripe in it

210
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:34,207
The ways you can tell the differences between things you generally it's

211
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,999
Simplehuman Pakistan for it

212
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
Can you code

213
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Feel

214
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
And

215
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,007
So in Australian money we have Al

216
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,431
Primarily by color which in some ways is a better index because it doesn't require knowledge of who's on the bill and

217
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
It only requires

218
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
Recognition of a color

219
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,295
Or in association with a pineapple World Lobster

220
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
It's not

221
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
Very common just yet but we cool at night

222
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:07,231
SoundClick remains but I colors and what two personal favorite cycling a $20 night witches

223
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
Orange-colored killing a lobster

224
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
And cooling a $50

225
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,119
Which is a survey

226
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,679
A green and yellow color and Cooling in a plane

227
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
Which is short for pineapple

228
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:24,127
It's all about the pineys number to size

229
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,527
Feel different in your hand in my pocket I can tell the difference between a $5

230
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:37,183
Because they feel I would say that it's about a centimeter difference between each denomination which

231
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,743
Between a 5 and a 10 isn't that big

232
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,559
But between a 5 and a 50 is

233
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Very big

234
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
4 centimeters difference

235
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,751
Both number one and two relate to the third issue raised by Richard Smith

236
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,335
And that's functionality you can see whether you got

237
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
A5

238
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
10

239
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,223
A 20 or a 50 from the top of your wallet because of the color and size difference

240
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:06,367
Number for composition 2 combat counter

241
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,927
Feel like plastic when you can fold and scrunch up

242
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,511
Actually put it through the washing machine and it'll be fine

243
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
If you drop the note on the

244
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,351
Florida Men's Room you don't really feel bad about

245
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,167
Picking it up and putting it under the faucet before you put it back in your car

246
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,823
Just more but they last longer fits in the last four times longer than fibrous paper

247
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
20 years old and I

248
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,199
Pretty much just look the same

249
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,063
What Australia chooses to put on its currency is more in keeping with literature

250
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,879
Smith of the dollar redesign project would like to see

251
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,463
It's much more inclusive and founding fathers and monuments

252
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,535
But it's hard to tell these symbols are conveyed much of anything

253
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Everyday

254
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Australian

255
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
They don't put

256
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,679
Statesman on on money frequently there are artists

257
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
And

258
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
I think

259
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
Are there some Aboriginal leaders

260
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,383
If there's another thing till you couldn't awful prime minister's on

261
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
On a money

262
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
We don't have the reference

263
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
No promises

264
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
The most Australian

265
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
Couldn't name

266
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
The people that

267
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
Are on their money

268
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,135
I've absolutely no idea who is on any

269
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:15,999
Except for one side of the V Illinois is the queen and I just because I don't want around there

270
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,863
Any Australian if they know who is on their nose

271
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:27,519
EBay would be less than 1% of people who did nine anybody other than Queen symbolism in Australian cash seems to be

272
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
Tidemore the innovation of the bills themselves

273
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
Is a certain Pride

274
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
Polymer bills were developed in Australia

275
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
And have been exported to the rest of the world

276
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,087
Australia now manufactures the polymer notes of nearly 20 other country

277
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
It's a good business for them

278
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,463
The good design of the currency itself is the overriding brand

279
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,815
It's no ordinary night

280
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,887
I'm supposed to Pelican printed right here I would like to

281
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
Steve's American currency

282
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,959
Redesign

283
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
Treated more like a living

284
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Technology

285
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Rather than rocks

286
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
I think

287
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Even the most

288
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
Jingoistic Among Us

289
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
Yes could concede that there are design Innovations

290
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:12,831
That could be incorporated into US currency to make it better but there are some interesting reasons why we pray

291
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Probably

292
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
You know someone once told me that

293
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
Getting rid of the Greenback would be like

294
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Burning the flag

295
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
On the steps of the capitol

296
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,351
That David woman has David woman my book is the end of mine

297
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,703
A lot of people are currently it's a physical touchdown of our national identity

298
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
Some of this is emotional

299
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
But there is this

300
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
Other concern that is

301
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Can you play 1011

302
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
Scary

303
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:43,295
And that other concern is that when you redesign the money you remind people what currency is

304
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
And what gives the currency value

305
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
Of course what gives the currency value

306
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Is our belief

307
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
That it's valuable

308
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
In in the religious

309
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Nothing more than faith

310
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,863
Are TriStar worship whatever you want to call it makes a dollar

311
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,191
Warsaw dollar or worth whatever you're going to buy with

312
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
So

313
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
That is upsetting to a lot of people and

314
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,103
To maintain the

315
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,175
Aura of strength and stability of the United States

316
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Economy

317
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
It probably helps to maintain these Legacy

318
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
Key features in the design of our money

319
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Through

320
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
What is now

321
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,903
Three or four generations we had the same color I think since I

322
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
War

323
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
Portraits engraved styling

324
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Filigree

325
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
Legacy features convey

326
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
Stability

327
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,143
An hour currency the currency on which all other currencies are hitched

328
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
Has to be stable

329
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
So not only do we not redesign the stuff

330
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
But we don't

331
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,823
Pull older notes from circulation either

332
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
So we'll have

333
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
Reissues and redesign

334
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
AmeriCash

335
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,759
But you can still use

336
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
The last generation

337
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
Design

338
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
As legal tender

339
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,951
In other countries a complete redesign deprecates the old design

340
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:59,839
You giving a Grace. To use or exchange it but after a certain date the old currency is shredded by the central bank

341
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
And you can no longer

342
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
Spend any that you have left

343
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,215
This is never been the case in the US

344
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,799
You can even use it an 18th century coin stamped with

345
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,871
Is the value of $0.02 to go buy something you might want to be careful

346
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
Because I can be

347
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
So stupid

348
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
It could be worse

349
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,503
You know $3,000 to a collector out

350
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
But if you want to go spend it as $0.02

351
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
You can

352
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
And again that this is part of

353
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
Greetings Aura of

354
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
Super stability and

355
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
Inherent value

356
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
Of Federal Reserve notes

357
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,375
David woman is quick to point out that even though these concerns of instability have

358
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,471
Excited when people bring up redesign the money or eliminating the penny

359
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
He thinks it's

360
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Pretty Arash

361
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
In an overly

362
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Play cautious.

363
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
It seems to me a little bit patronizing

364
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:48,735
To think that Americans couldn't handle a dollar redesign really who is going to push it forward

365
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,527
You know if you're going to go to work in government

366
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,831
Don't you almost by definition have

367
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,623
Some of that sense of

368
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,999
Patriotism and nationalism that would make you a little bit more inclined to like

369
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
Greenback as is

370
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
And a little less inclined to

371
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
You let some

372
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
Really hot dogs get after it

373
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,895
But still primarily driven by anti-counterfeiting measures

374
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,479
US currency has been pushed to change in recent years

375
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,039
And most of these new designs are why it looks

376
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Worse than

377
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Ever

378
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,415
Legacy features remained largely intact for the lair

379
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
Modern

380
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
Fonts swirls mix

381
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
The bills look like they're busting at the

382
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,839
Seems it's the worst of Both Worlds

383
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
Absolute chaos

384
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
Is very little Italian

385
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
About

386
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
Are money from ads Einstein

387
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
As far as I

388
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
When I told David woman about my newfound.

389
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,687
Discovery and appreciation of the Australian dollar as evangelized by Tristan and Tom

390
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
He was less

391
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
I don't I don't think it's that remarkable

392
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,367
Congratulations to the Aziz and the scientists who came up with

393
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
Polymer banknotes

394
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
And I think

395
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,999
They profited well because of that innovation

396
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,815
But I'm just not convinced it's very world-changing

397
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Pretty

398
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
Hey I personally think pretty count

399
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,751
But from his point of view a better design banknote even a plastic one is

400
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Still

401
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Just a piece

402
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Paper

403
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,615
I mean his book is called the end of money

404
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Dad design efforts

405
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,735
Out there related to money that excite me more

406
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
R-design

407
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,183
The user interface of apps for mobile money right how are we going to be transacting with money in PayPal mobile

408
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
Golang Google Wallet

409
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,279
What are designers bringing to bear on those interface

410
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
Because the interface with

411
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
Paper or polymer money

412
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
I get it already

413
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,215
Truly interesting Frontier of design

414
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
Is not going to be

415
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
The banknote

416
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
Art

417
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,871
But the Swiss come up with in 26

418
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
Phrase going to be

419
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
The interface

420
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,271
With mobile apps and what designers are doing

421
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
To make

422
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
Our interactions

423
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
With money

424
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
More fluid

425
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
More sophisticated

426
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:09,791
Possibly got forget even like wiser you know who's who's designing the app

427
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
To make a little more

428
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
Careful with our money

429
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
And how are they

430
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,447
Bringing today hours of the principles of design to make that happen

431
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,055
And this is something that Tristan and Tom are totally on board with

432
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,431
Physical money is probably on its way out and polymer money as cool as it is

433
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
Is it technology

434
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
David Stein

435
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:35,391
They themselves have actually designed clever user interfaces so that the good aspects of physical money already

436
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,767
And transactions feel more tangible and morio even when it's just bits

437
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,047
Define Revere

438
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:48,959
So that physical us $20 bill will probably be gone from widespread use before it's a lovely shade

439
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
Date of Orange erad

440
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
I'm okay with

441
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,895
Does it long enough to see that wavy Six Flag amusement park font

442
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,199
It says 20 USA in the background

443
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
I mean seriously

444
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
What the hell were they thinking

445
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,111
That phone is even cruel to Andrew Jackson

Hover makes it super easy and fun and if you're like me and you'll get

457
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,175
Even more ideas by registering those domains in the restroom more

458
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,735
I think I might actually have a problem

What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

515

Being honest

520
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,192
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

521
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,544
A few days ago Wesley Stern

522
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,872
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

523

526
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,624
The cops think that I had something to do with it

527
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Now

528
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,952
