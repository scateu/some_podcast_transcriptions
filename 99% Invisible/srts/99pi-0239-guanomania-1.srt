I'm Roman Mars

33
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,976
In 2014 President Obama expanded the Pacific remote Islands Marine National Monument

34
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,560
Making it the largest Marine Preserve in the world at the time

35
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:45,216
Pacific remote Islands Marine preserve is farther from Human settlement than any other us

36
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:51,872
The president expansion of the reserve today will close 400,000 square miles

Star Ocean 2 commercial fishing

00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,736
Underwater mine and you look in the map

00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Preserve

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
Really is nowhere near the United

41
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,880
It's thousands of miles from the US mainland

42
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,928
That's reporter Emmett Fitzgerald

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
It's not even that close to Hawaii

44
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,304
It's somehow President Obama was able to protect this piece of

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
In the name of the United States

46
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,216
And to understand how the United States has jurisdiction over these Waters in the middle of the

47
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,800
We got to go all the way back to the 19th century

48
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
When for a brief period

49
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,152
US Sailors scoured the ocean

50
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
Looking for Rocky island

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712

00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,552
With a lot of people think I was.

54
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
Just bat poop

55
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,416
I think most people think of guano is bad poop but it but in this case we're talking about

56
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
Birds and seabirds

57
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
Sosie bird poop

58
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
That's Paul Sutter

00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,584
A professor of history at the University of Colorado at Boulder

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
In the mid 1800

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,168
It's the United States became obsessed with a quest

62
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
Define incel guano

63
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
To use as fertilizer

64
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
Terron Farms

65
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
People believed it would revolutionize farming

66
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
And it did

67
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
At least for a little while

68
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,736
But the Quest for bird poop ultimately had even bigger ramifications

69
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,880
The use of sea bird poop as fertilizer starts in South America

70
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
Originates

71
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,208
I will deposit off

72
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
The coast

73
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
I approve

74
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,304
Southwest Peru and prickly three

75
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
Islands are called a chinchilla

76
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
Islands

77
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,264
Potential Island on the middle of a nutrient-rich current with tons of Plankton and massive schools of fish

78
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,568
And there are seabirds that live on the

79
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,384
Getting fat off all these fish

80
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
They're gorging themselves

81
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
Financial View

82
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,552
And they're defecating all over these islands across

83
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
Hundreds if not thousands of years

84
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,904
And it almost never rained on the tenth Island

85
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
So over time

86
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
Keeps piling up

87
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
And as a result these deposits build up

88
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
100 feet deep

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
In places

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
Exercise with 10-story building

91
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
Of poop

92
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
For centuries

93
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
Is the quechua people

94
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Going through

95
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,104
Wood mine is guano Mountain

96
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
And spread the bird poop out on their feet

97
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,480
And it worked they were real a successful farmer

98
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,808
And the Spanish who colonized the region begin

99
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
Noticing this

100
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,392
And and and really dabbled in it

101
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,976
But scientist in Europe didn't really get interested in guano

102
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,559
Until the same depression naturalist Alexander Von Humboldt

103
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
Visited the Peruvian

104
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
Coast in 1800s

105
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,703
He's all laborers unloading ships full of bird poop

106
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
And you took a sample and brought it back with him to Europe

107
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,919
In the early 19th century a German chemist named Justus Von liebig began arguing that soil fertility basically

108
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
Came down to just a few critical nutrient

109
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Nitrogen

110
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Bosporus

111
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
And potassium

112
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
And that

113
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Soil fertility can be

114
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,671
I restored or maintained

115
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,719
By adding those nutrients

116
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Those

117
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
Chemical or mineral nutrient

118
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
To the soil

119
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,679
Peruvian guano had really high concentrations of all three of these new

120
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Especially night

121
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,287
It was the agricultural analog to discover

122
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Ringgold

123
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:08,991
Peruvians began to mine guano on a commercial scale and they struck deals with British merchants to sell Peruvian guano

124
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Go back in Europe

125
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,855
And they set up shop on the chincha islands in and they initially rely on

126
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
On local

127
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,231
Semi coerced labor but eventually they

128
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Get into importing

129
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
Chinese labor

130
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
This Is Us

131
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,375
Form of of bonded contract labor so they're also

132
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
Paid very little

133
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,215
It's a very abusive labor system

134
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
They are

135
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
Mislead in terms of

136
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
The terms of the Steal

137
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
The miners lived on the island

138
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
Intense and Bamboo Shack

139
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,711
And I have to wait at the guano deposits with shovel

140
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Send pickaxe

141
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
Practice 17 hours a day

142
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:47,135
They're chipping away at the Squanto they're they're sending it down giant shoots

143
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,183
Often right into the holds of ships

144
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
This is incredibly accurate

145
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Caustic

146
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Stop

147
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
It gets in their lungs

148
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
It's really debilitating

149
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,495
Mattoon Farmers all across Europe were using Peruvian guano on their fields

150
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,567
Two of the companies profiting the most office New

151
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,639
Trade war w j Myers from Liverpool

152
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
And Gibson

153
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,015
London the result of slogan that said the house of Gibbs

154
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,831
Made their dibs selling the turds of foreign Birds

155
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,207
Word of the fertilizing power of seabird poop eventually reaches the United States

156
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
Where commercial farming

157
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,815
And particularly on slave plantations in the south

158
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,375
Head strip the soil of a lot of its neutral

159
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
Is Dorothy Farmers would plant cover crops

160
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,311
Practice crop rotation or raise cattle for manure production in order to keep their soil healthy

161
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,199
Or they would just perform a field until they had exhausted its nutrients and then move on to a new piece of land

162
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,783
But British merchants began advertising a new product

163
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,855
It would help American farmers stay in one place

164
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
And maximize their yields

165
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
Peruvian guano

166
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,535
Planters begin to experiment with it as a way of increasing

167
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,583
Their yields and in some cases have

168
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
Really good results

169
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,935
Soon agricultural Publications in the US

170
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
Icewarp raising guano

171
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Magical properties

172
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,823
And Farmers throughout the country began using it

173
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
How to fertilize their fields

174
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,455
By the late 1840s the United States was in the grips of what historians have called

175
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
Guano Mania

176
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,343
Importing tens of thousands of tons of bird poop every year

177
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,647
The US was birdshit

178
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
Crazy

179
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:29,023
But because British firms had a monopoly over the Peruvian guano trade

180
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
Guano was expensive

181
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,679
Farmers began to petition Washington to help them get cheap Guana

182
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,007
At one point of the president of the United States Millard Fillmore

183
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,823
Ennis 1850 annual dress

184
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,639
Makes guano security

185
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
A kind of

186
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
Important point

187
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Nevada trash

188
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,319
Peruvian guano has become so desirable in Article 2

189
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
The agricultural interest of the United

190
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
States that it is the duty of the governor

191
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
To employee Albany

192
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Is properly in it

193
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,327
Power for the purpose of causing that article to be imported into the country at our

194
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Reasonable price

195
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
But

196
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
Fillmore was mostly talk

197
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,959
Iguana prices continued

198
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Just sore

199
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
And so us business

200
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
Start to take matters into their own

201
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,919
The beginning going out looking for other islands with new sources of guano

202
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,039
Empties bird poop Prospectors come across an uninhabited island in the Caribbean

203
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Call Abba

204
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
In 1854 a group of Americans

205
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Landed there

206
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
What to Mine

207
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
The guano

208
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
And attempted to claim the island

209
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
That's Christina Duffy ponsa

210
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
And I'm a law professor at

211
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Columbia

212
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:41,471
Influenza says that us guano mining on all that set off a minor diplomatic crisis

213
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
Venezuela felt that the island belong to them

214
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
And they ended up sending a warship

215
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
The kick the guano company off the island

216
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,711
But when they got home the guano Prospectors asked Congress

217
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
To pass legislation

218
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
They would protect them

219
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,063
If they try to claim New Island

220
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:01,695
So US citizens could feel like they had the backing of the US government if they encounter a controversy

221
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Like military.

222
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
Meaning

223
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
You guys can go out

224
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Take these off

225
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
And if anyone shows up with warships

226
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Will bring ours to

227
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
And in the debate over this life

228
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
Politicians argued about guano prices and other details

229
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,127
But there were also some Senators who expressed a larger concern

230
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:25,247
They worried that by taking over islands for the purposes of mining guano

231
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,111
The United States could be perceived as having Imperial aspirations

232
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
Secretly trying to set up

233
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,975
Colonies and engage in territorial

234
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
Expansion

235
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
By claiming Islands

236
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:42,143
In the Atlantic and the Pacific and all over the world and a little context

237
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
Is important here

238
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
This is all happening

239
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,519
Against the backdrop of European Colonial

240
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:52,127
Great Britain is about to establish its colonial government in India

241
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,479
And various European countries will soon colonize nearly all of Africa

242
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:02,879
The United States had taken over much of North America and violently stole territory from indigenous people

243
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
But political leaders at the time didn't think of this as colonialism because the US always Incorporated new territory

244
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Into the country

245
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
Rather than maintaining colony

246
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
The US also prided itself

247
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,215
On being a nation born out of a revolution against

248
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
Imperial power

249
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
So the United States

250
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
Did that and has always conceived

251
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
Of itself as

252
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
An Anti-Imperialist

253
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Country

254
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,967
And distinguished itself

255
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:32,831
From European powers who in this. In the 19th century were acquiring territories

256
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
All over the globe

257
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:39,487
And so even though in the case of the guano Islands they're talking about cleaning uninhabited rocks

258
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,327
Some Senators think that this looks a little too close to colonialism

259
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
Converse

260
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,191
So they work on developing language that will mitigate any fears

261
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
List of the US

262
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,263
Is trying to set up overseas colonies

263
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
So

264
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
Eventually

265
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,383
As the Senate goes to a series of drafts

266
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
The way that the Islanders

267
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
Describe is not as part of the territory of the United States or subject to the sovereignty of the United States those words drop

268
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,159
About they are described as appertaining

269
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
To the United

270
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
It states as in

271
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,767
A sort of fancy old fashioned way of saying

272
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
Belonging to

273
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
Appertaining

274
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,959
I think about that word was that at the time no one really knew what it meant from a legal perspective

275
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,775
But it was softer than saying we own this

276
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
The towers

277
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
The Senators also included in abandoned

278
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:33,247
Which said that the United States could relinquish possession over the islands once the guano had been exhausted

279
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
And with all these caveats in place

280
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
1856

281
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
Congress passed

282
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
The guano Islands

283
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
And at that point

284
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
American citizens

285
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
Start cleaning

286
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
Islands

287
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,167
All over the place is really companies that want a Mindless guano start sending people out and telling them to claim these islands

288
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,751
In total us companies claimed over 70 Island

289
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Throughout the Pacific

290
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
And the Caribbean

291
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,895
Indigenous Polynesians and Hawaiians mine guano for us companies

292
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
It's on far-flung Pacific Islands

293
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
And after the Civil War

294
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
Guangzhou companies recruited

295
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,295
Free black men

296
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,087
Tomine guano on Caribbean

297
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
Like in Peru

298
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
Us guano mining was

299
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
Brutal

300
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
And workers were off

301
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Coerced

302
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Horribly

303
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,399
Automania didn't last all that long in the end

304
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
By the 18

305
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
70s

306
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,751
The bass guano deposits on the island

307
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Almost gone

308
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,639
Many of the islands the United States took didn't turn out to have very good Guana

309
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
And synthetic fertilizer

310
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
Just around the corner

311
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,039
And while the history of the guano trade isn't often talked about

312
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,391
It had lasting impacts that are still incredibly relevant to this day

313
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:48,511
The guano trade introduced the idea that soil fertility could be bought and sold

314
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,839
Set of carefully attending to their soil on the farm

315
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,679
Farmers can just buy this one supplement and sprinkling on their field

316
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:01,311
This paved the way for the fertilizer fueled industrial agriculture that we see today

317
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
And the guano Islands Act

318
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
Set a precedent

319
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,687
That would help and Mabel future Act

320
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
Some American imperialism

321
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,527
On islands that were very much in half

322
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,695
Around the turn of the twentieth century the United States goes to war with Spain over the

323
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
Occupation of Cuba

324
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
Ban the US win

325
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:25,631
So after the Spanish American War what happens is the United States

326
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Cakes

327
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
Puerto Rico

328
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
And the Philippines

329
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,751
And Guam as

330
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,823
Basically part of its War booty for defeating

331
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
Spain in

332
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,455
Cuba interview clear these territories were taken as Spoils of War not

333
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
As part of the guano Islands Act

334
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
But when the US annexed

335
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,343
Is Island territories in 1898

336
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,415
It sets off a huge debate about what to do next

337
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,719
You could make these places in the states

338
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
But the white political establishment

339
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,631
Wasn't too excited about absorbing a bunch of islands full of people of color

340
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
It's about race

341
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,727
More than anything else white Americans

342
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
Want the nation to be a white Nation

343
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,847
So this is the same. Of time

344
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,431
In which American start tightening their immigration laws

345
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,527
But politicians were reluctant to give up territory with real strategic value

346
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
In 1901 this question

347
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,135
About the status of Puerto Rico and the Philippines

348
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Makes its way to the Sea

349
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Supreme Court

350
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
In a case involving Goods that are shipped

351
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,535
From Puerto Rico to the United

352
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:30,655
The dispute arises around a shipment of oranges from Puerto Rico to New York

353
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,751
When the shipment arrives in New York the Customs collector and poses

354
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,079
Duties on the oranges as if they were coming from a foreign country

355
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
And the

356
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
A company shipping them challenges the duties

357
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Saying

358
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,735
Puerto Rico is part of the United States

359
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,575
The Constitution says that you can impose duties on any Goods be

360
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
Ship within the country

361
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
This case

362
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Taxi Norwich

363
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
Decide this case

364
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,255
The court would need to answer a bigger question

365
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,327
What relationship do these islands have

366
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,351
To the United States

367
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,959
In the end the Court ruled that imposing a duty is okay

368
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,287
Because these new places Puerto Rico Guam the Philippines

369
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Or not

370
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
Fully a part of the United States

371
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
But in their decision

372
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,735
The justices make clear that they aren't foreign either

373
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,807
The famous phrase from these cases is that there

374
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Foreign

375
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
To the United States

376
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
In a domestic sense

377
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
It's a it's an odd phrase

378
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,095
At the time no one really knows what it means it basically creates a limbo and in between status

379
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Some of the justices

380
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
When did to the guano Islands

381
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
As a justification for creating this

382
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
In-between status

383
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,359
And went on to say that these new territories were

384
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Fortunate

385
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Appurtenant

386
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
As in

387
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
A burkini

388
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,039
And there's that word that word appertaining

389
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
From the guano Islands

390
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,135
When even then and after then

391
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,951
Still lawyers trying to understand what that word means

392
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
Can't quite make sense

393
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:04,607
They're never quite sure what you know all we know is this is the way of kind of holding a place at arm's length while still controlling it

394
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,447
It's impossible to know whether this case would have been

395
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Differently if

396
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,031
If the US had never gone looking for guano

397
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
But the guano Islands setopress

398
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
And

399
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
That gives

400
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,431
La Corte familiar and legitimate

401
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
Mode of reasoning

402
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,039
In creating a status that was really an invention

403
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,855
A territory that belong to the United States

404
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
Wasn't a state

405
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,231
And some of these territories still have this limbo status

406
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
Puerto Rico

407
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,327
Still has the status of a foreign

408
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,143
In a domestic sense territory of the United States

409
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
And that's also the case

410
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,751
Before other territories the US Virgin Islands

411
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,567
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands

412
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:50,175
Guam and American Samoa all these places are in a form of limbo

413
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:56,575
In the United States ambivalent relationship with extraterritorial Island all started with the guano Islands Act

414
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:03,231
A legal framework that allowed the US to take control over a place without making it fully a part of the country

415
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
Puerto Rico isn't a state

416
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
Nor is it an independent nation

417
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Puerto Ricans are US citizens

418
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,959
But they can't vote in US presidential elections

419
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
And Professor poncy who is from Puerto Rico says that being stuck in this colonial limbo Apple

420
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,919
Pertaining but not belonging to the United States

421
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,735
Has stalled progress on the island

422
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
For over a hundred years

423
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,135
Puerto Ricans have spent a lot of time and political energy trying to decide whether to pursue

424
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
Statehood or Independence

425
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,487
And it is done a great deal of harm in Puerto Rico

426
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,535
Because it distorts politics

427
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,119
When you're when you're arguing about questions is foundational

428
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
As should we be a state or not

429
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
It really Hans Puerto Rico's political life

430
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
The guano Islands Act

431
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,847
Is still law

432
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,503
In fact in the 1990s a man from California named Bill Warren tried to claim the abandoned island of navassa

433
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
As his own private guano

434
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
EBay

435
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,927
But the US still holds claim over a few of the old guano Island

436
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
Pacific

437
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:12,095
Some of these islands ended up having some kind of strategic value was Landing strips and they had other kinds of military uses

438
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,679
Amelia Earhart was planning to land on a guano Island

439
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
To refuel

440
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
When her plane went down

441
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
In the Pacific

442
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,335
And President Obama used guano Island possession

443
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
Expand one of the largest Marine

444
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
In the world

445
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:32,831
The guano islands in the Pacific that the u.s. still controls are now called the United States minor outlying Islands

446
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
They don't have any permanent rest

447
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,951
A few military officials and scientists live there throughout the year

448
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,743
These little rocky Island

449
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,303
What's our ongoing projections of the American Empire

450
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,607
In a reminder about the time

451
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,143
Guano Mania

452
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
Gripped the world

453
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,535

Between the beats

465

Bongs and Charter of our devices

466
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,631
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

467
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
If

468
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:57,055
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

469
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,151
All hearing that voice

470
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Technology

471
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
He talked to us

472
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
It is a creation of Sonic trash

473
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,063
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

474
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,647
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

475
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,439
To make them more human

476
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
Turn the living room lights on

477
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
Okay

478
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,887
Dim the living room lights to 50%

479
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Okay

480
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:30,079
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

481
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Mix

482
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383

483
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151

Turn the living room lights on

485
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271

Constipation

Abdominal pain and bloating yourself

497
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,735
It's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine

498
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,783
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,159
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

Comic mystery

515
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
That whines through a

516
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,248
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

517
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,784

Might cost you your life

519
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:21,696
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

520
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:26,048
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

521
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,376
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

522
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,400
Adad

523
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,752
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

524
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:39,104
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main got to know how to do that kind

525
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:46,528
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

526
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,856
Was found dead in my private gym

527
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,184
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

528
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,536
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

529
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
Now

530
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,864
I need to clear my name

531
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,264
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
