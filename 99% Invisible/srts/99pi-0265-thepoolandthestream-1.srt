This is 99% invisible

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,888
I'm Roman Mars

22
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,496
When people ask us where we get our stories from

23
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,056
The answer is usually hard to pin down

24
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:20,384
It could be something one of us noticed walking around

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
Or something a friend mention

26
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,480
Some forwarded link on Twitter

27
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,552
It's nearly impossible to say where inspiration comes from

28
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
Nner

29
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,672
It's a long way from the seed of an idea to its execution

30
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,328
The brilliant architect Alvar aalto put it very well in an extended metaphor about a fish in a stream

31
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
He wrote

32
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,472
Architecture and its details are in some way all part of biology

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,568
Perhaps they are Princeton like some big salmon or trout

34
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
They're not born fully-grown

35
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,200
They're not even born in the city or water where they normally live

36
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,528
They are born hundreds of miles away from their home grounds

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,600
Where the rivers narrow to Tiny streams

38
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:07,232
Justice it takes time for us back a fishpond to mature into a fully grown fish

39
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,584
So we need time for everything that develops and crystallizes

40
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
In our world of ideas

41
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,264
This is a story about one idea born hundreds of miles away

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
Cinnabar off stream

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
An idea that would travel

44
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
From northern Europe

45
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
To Southern California

46
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,200
Or it would take on a whole new life

47
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
Before making its way back again

48
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
It's a story in three parts

49
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,576
By producer Avery Shuffle

50
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,208
Part 1

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
California

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,376
Two skaters in a plaza are confronted by a guard

53
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
Can't skate here

54
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
Oh man it looks so good

55
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
Just one broken leg please

56
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,408
It's kind of a Pity that skateboarding is banned in so many places

57
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,528
Because skateboarders appreciate the small details of architecture more than anyone

58
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
They recognize the quality of concrete

59
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
The Greenwood

60
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
The incline of a stroke

61
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,744
They recognized the way of landscape

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
Flo's

63
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
Start biking

64
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
My name is Jake Phelps I'm the editor at Thrasher magazine from San Francisco California born and raised

65
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
What are you got

66
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,872
Thrasher is a skateboarding magazine that skaters called the Bible visiting its headquarters is kind of surreal

67
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:33,504
It's like if you went to a skatepark and yelled at to all the pugs hey you guys want to go hang out in an office

68
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
They're all there

69
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
Sneakers and beanie caps

70
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,880
Lunch behind monitors like caged animals

71
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,536
You can tell they rather be skating costumes of my life

72
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:50,912
I don't wear Louis Vuitton clothes and fitted them and I wear sneakers

73
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,520
And this is the way it is we were utilitarian we skate

74
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
It's the greatest thing in the world

75
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,616
Jake Phelps is 55 years old

76
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
Tattoos all over his arms

77
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,760
Big stick glasses over his face and close-cropped gray hair

78
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,624
He blatantly hits on me in the interview and invites me to his punk band show over the weekend

79
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,672
I don't think he'd mind that I told you that

80
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
Skateboarding never says no

81
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Girlfriends

82
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
Jobs life people always say no can't do that

83
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
I've been doing this for 40 years you can't tell me a joke

84
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
State of Kuwait

85
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
KFOR News

86
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
You know it's like

87
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
Extension of me

88
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
It's like the dark

89
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,639
It's something you have to understand

90
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
So what is

91
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
Where does the artist

92
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
It's your whole

93
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
You want to see how you how you

94
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
You hold yourself

95
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
And that is why I love you

96
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
That sort of

97
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,463
Badass devil-may-care attitude that skaters have perfected

98
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
That's kind of funny because skateboarding

99
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,839
Was pretty dorky back when it was just getting started

100
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,423
The very first skateboard was called the skateboard scooter

101
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
And it was a scooter

102
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
This is Stacy Peralta

103
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,359
Skateboarding Pioneer and director of the excellent documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys

104
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
Which is all about the birth of modern skateboarding

105
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:11,807
CC says at some point no one really knows when but someone knocked the handlebars off the scooter

106
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
I just rode the board

107
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,647
And probably emulated surfing

108
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,927
And so what happened was

109
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,743
Skateboarding had a very very brief

110
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
Appearance in 1960

111
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
4 + 65

112
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
Skateboards were sold in toy stores

113
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,679
And skateboarding briefly became a fad

114
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
But then as quickly as it started

115
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,495
Died out again

116
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
It was like a hula hoop

117
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
It has come and gone

118
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,151
As a skateboard fad was receding into the distance

119
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,223
Stacy was growing up in Venice Beach California

120
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:44,831
Was the early 70s and Stacy was a little surf rat with long blond hair

121
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
I'm on the waves were bad in the middle of the day

122
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:52,255
Guinness friends wanted something to do what we really wanted to do was emulate surfing

123
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
They wanted to surf

124
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
On land

125
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
And they discovered old skateboards

126
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,727
One of my friends his older brothers at skateboarding in the very early 60s

127
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,823
And they had two skateboards left in their garage that they never touched

128
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
So we started riding those boards

129
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,919
Early skateboards

130
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,247
Hard clunky wheels made out of clay or Steel

131
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,831
Eat dirt if you ran over a pebble or a penny on the ground

132
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,415
Indictment Rick Saturday very simple like

133
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,255
I can stand up straight or I can balance on the tip of the board

134
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
Maybe a wheelie

135
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
You could just kind of scoop back and forth

136
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,887
On a flat smooth surface

137
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
Flatland tricks

138
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
That's basically what you could do

139
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,799
DC was really young like maybe 7 years old

140
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,359
You can remember skating for the first time

141
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,663
Even with those big clunky clay wheel

142
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
Little Stacy found

143
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
A blissful Stillness

144
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,551
It was so profound that

145
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
From that point forward

146
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,415
I needed to get back on that board and find that Stillness because

147
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,255
I'm more relaxed when I stand on a skateboard that I'm when I walk

148
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,607
What season is friends were discovering skateboards while the rest of the country was forgetting them

149
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:06,239
Stacy had that old board heat on Earth then his friend the garage after I wore that out there was no more boards

150
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
Casino that I can buy in stores

151
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,591
You couldn't buy a skateboard back then so instead

152
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Cece and his friends

153
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Thrift store

154
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
And buy a pair of roller skates

155
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
Which had clay or metal or hard place

156
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Classic Wheels

157
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
And maybe

158
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,063
Stacy would take the left skate and his friend would

159
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
Pick the right skate

160
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,903
And then cut the bases out the wheels and put them

161
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
Are plank of wood

162
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,511
And then ride that back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth for hours

163
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
And the hours that we spent doing it would be equivalent to a kid today you know jumping up and down for 8 hours in a pogo

164
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,983
You know every single day 7 days a week and

165
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
You probably goat cheese

166
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,103
Maybe we should tell this kid that there's no future in this

167
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:48,735
Then in the early 70s invention comes along that would revolutionize skateboarding

168
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
The urethane wheel

169
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
This soft plastic will have more give to it and held the ground

170
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,951
Unlike those clunky dangerous claywheels leprosy today

171
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,815
These soft Wheels were intended for roller skaters at the dawn of the roller disco era

172
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,679
But a small company called creative urethane begin producing urethane Wheels

173
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,703
Pacifically

174
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,103
4 skateboard

175
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
Surf shops

176
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:22,271
Hunter Werner skate shop and they were advertised in Surfer magazine

177
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,367
Anime summer of 1974 sales of urethane Wheels went

178
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
Gangbusters

179
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,951
Suddenly we had a wheel that could grip

180
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
And I could roll over bumps in Little Rock's

181
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:38,399
A little louder us to attack terrain that previously were not we were not able to attack

182
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,191
Now they could skate all surfaces

183
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
Greater Los Angeles was theirs

184
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:48,895
Claim it so that means School yards that meant in garages City buildings it was any place

185
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,687
Anything was rideable

186
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,991
But none of this was designed for us

187
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
None of it

188
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,111
These young kids were jumping fences and trespassing breaking things

189
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,159
On search of new surfaces to ride

190
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,463
They were reinterpreting the city around them

191
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,791
Finding the beauty in the pavement and the concrete

192
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
And then

193
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
In the mid-70s

194
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
There's a drought

195
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
In California

196
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,031
In Southern California

197
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
Brush fires

198
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Some of them big

199
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
And expensive

200
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
Aurora fires with

201
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
California

202
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
Favorite

203
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
Right now

204
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
Worcester State

205
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
The drop was so bad in the 70

206
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,231
That the water company ran billboard ads

207
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Did encouraged

208
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
Couples to shower together

209
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
To save water

210
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
And the further save water

211
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,423
People didn't fill up their swimming pool

212
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
And in Los Angeles

213
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
There a lot of swimming pool

214
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
And they're very

215
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
Thinktiv

216
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,895
What we had in Los Angeles if we had the big

217
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,455
Beautiful voluptuous shapes

218
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,039
That you did not see anywhere else in the world that you find in less

219
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,623
Except in very very very very small quantities

220
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,951
The pools of Los Angeles are shaped like peanuts

221
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
Like Keyhole

222
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,511
White kidney beans

223
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
They have

224
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
Curved

225
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
Undulating edges

226
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:17,727
There paved even smooth concrete with gently varying rounded depth

227
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
Look back up to the lip

228
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
And

229
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
During the drought in the 70s

230
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
They were all

231
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Auntie

232
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
They were

233
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
They just

234
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,319
We're so beautifully conceived and designed and

235
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
We fell in love with the shape

236
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
Stacy and his friends with a hunt for pool

237
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:43,071
They find a house under construction or Patrol the fancy part of town where they knew they'd find the most sumptuous

238
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Luxurious pool

239
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Tony

240
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,959
They have the fence they break in

241
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,311
There's a little bit of old dirty water in the pool they drain it out themselves

242
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,895
Buckets they brought or trash cans a pound or eventually

243
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
They bring an industrial vacuum along with them

244
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
And then

245
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
Up and down the pool

246
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
They go so fast they could go up

247
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
The wall

248
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,183
Escape like they were surfing a wave

249
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
When we finally got to write swimming pools

250
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
And feel weightless

251
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
Like going up a vertical wall

252
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
Weightlessness is pretty extraordinary

253
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,703
Skateboarding became a form of choreography

254
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,031
We're trying to do as much as possible in The Limited space of the

255
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
I'm a graceful while doing it

256
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,151
Here we were a bunch of Scruffy kids

257
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:35,039
And here we are riding in Backyard Pools and we know what we're doing is beautiful and we get to feel beautiful

258
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,343
And this beauty attracted attention

259
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,927
Back in the first wave of skateboarding in the early 60s

260
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
There'd been a magazine called simply

261
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Skateboarder

262
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
It went out of business from skateboarding fad died out

263
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
But in the mid-70s

264
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,143
The magazine came back

265
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
And it featured

266
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
Stacy and his friends

267
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
Riding in backyard

268
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
Deadpool's

269
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,639
At that point every kid in America and all over the world wanted to get inside a swim

270
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
That was that was the Holy Grail

271
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
Instilled the drought

272
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,039
Really acted as a wonderful midwife

273
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
To the skateboarding

274
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,183
Eventually Stacy and the other skateboarders got so good at pool skating

275
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
They were able to

276
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
The up

277
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
Over the edge of the pool

278
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:21,375
Do you kind of jump up up in the air and maybe do a spin or something before dropping back into the pool

279
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
Annie's aerial tricks

280
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,983
Let's do another genre of skateboarding

281
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
So style became less important

282
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,847
An extreme Maneuvers became more important

283
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,663
Aerial tricks pave the way for the X game

284
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
Half pipes in Tony Hawk

285
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,319
This whole chapter of the sport where skaters were trying to vote themselves really really high up in the air

286
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
And that can all be traced back

287
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
To the rounded

288
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
Biomorphic pools

289
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Los Angeles

290
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
The ones shaped like peanuts

291
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
And keyholes

292
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
And kidney bean

293
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
La was

294
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
The backyard pool Mecca

295
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
But not just

296
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,055
The backyard pool Mecca the properly beautifully-designed backyard

297
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,871
And I don't know of any place in the world

298
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
That has that proliferation

299
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
Of that kind of voluptuous sensuous design

300
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
Pools of Southern California

301
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
And their proliferation

302
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,623
Led to the proliferation of skating

303
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,671
More people are skateboarding now than ever

304
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
List the 7 billion dollar industry God damn

305
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,887
That's Jake Phelps Thrasher again everyday people skating right now people just saw somebody just broke their arm in a

306
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Pool right now

307
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
Trust me

308
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,495
In the pools of California bring us to our next

309
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,567
Do you know the story about like where the bean-shaped will comes from

310
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,431
Being shape has to be in shape but I don't deserve the right any kidney

311
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Well yeah

312
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,831
No colored bean-shaped obviously would be

313
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,159
Some esoteric designs of someone's backyard

314
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Well Jake Phelps

315
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:55,839
Doesn't have to be all like that about it but he's right it starts with one esoteric design in someone's back

316
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,471
But it might be the most famous private backyard in 20th century American history

317
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
Part 2

318
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
Sonoma

319
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,431
On top of a remote Hill in Sonoma County in Northern California

320
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
The end of a long curvy dirt road

321
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
Car

322
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
Pulls into a driveway

323
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,599
Three small dogs rush hour to me

324
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
Original

325
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
Got a little lost

326
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,023
Sorry we overshot it a little bit

327
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,655
Justin fazioli and Sandy Donnell are the owners and caretakers of this property

328
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
Which is known as the Donnell Garden

329
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
It really famous in the world is landscape

330
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
But if you want to visit it it's kind of challenge

331
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
You can't find it on Google Maps

332
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
That address is wrong

333
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,991
And there aren't any public listing for sites with contact information for it

334
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
Because it's just a private home

335
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,135
Amara size retro modern looking house on a hill

336
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
It was Sandy's parents place

337
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,999
Minecraft on The Dental Ranch property

338
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,815
Born in 1951 the youngest of three children

339
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,631
The Donnell Garden was planted in 1948

340
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
He was revolutionary

341
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
At the time

342
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,239
Traditional Gardens of the early 20th century

343
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,079
I've been more or less symmetrical Rose a different kinds of flowers

344
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,639
They're kind of like plant museums

345
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,455
Maybe accented with a geometric heads or a fruit

346
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,271
The Donnell Garden is nothing like

347
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
It's mostly lawn

348
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
The lawn is

349
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
A unifying feature

350
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
Help me understand who everything

351
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,999
It becomes the river the Green River

352
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
That goes from space to

353
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
Space Garden looks like a

354
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
Sea of clean cut grass

355
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
The floating islands

356
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
The tropical plant clusters

357
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
Groups of rocks

358
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
In a few ancient oak trees

359
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
And there are a large swaths of concrete

360
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,103
A big wooden deck

361
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,407
From above the garden is almost like a

362
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Cheese collage

363
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
Arrangement of

364
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
Abstract shapes

365
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
On a green grass

366
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
The most distinctive shape

367
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Of course

368
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Is the pool

369
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,671
Oh my God there's the

370
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,719
Picked up your search

371
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
A kidney pool

372
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
From what we know

373
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,119
Was the first kidney-shaped pool in California

374
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
If every bit as beautiful as

375
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
I thought actually

376
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,287
It is bright pristine electric blue

377
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
And in the center of the pool is an abstract

378
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
Sculpture by adaline Kent

379
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
Which has two holes through

380
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
One above water

381
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
1 below

382
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,807
And you can swim through the holes in the sculpture like a dolphin and it's insanely fun

383
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
I know

384
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
Because I tried it

385
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,351
Pool Overlook Acres of Dusty Ranch and property

386
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,935
You can hear the hum of cars on a racetrack off in the distance

387
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,031
And you can see the hot tub skyline of San Francisco

388
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
Grooming hazel-e Beyond

389
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
I can help but think that is skater wood

390
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
Kill to drain the pool

391
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
Beautiful

392
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
Wow

393
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,111
It's hard to overstate the importance of the Donnell Garden

394
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,951
Formal landscape architecture and everyday American backyard

395
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,863
Sandy Donnell told me that a picture of the garden was in the Encyclopedia Britannica under landscape architecture

396
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,727
The property also helped create what we think of as the modern Suburban backyard

397
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,263
The lawn

398
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Deadpool

399
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,383
I would guess with the exception possibly of Versailles

400
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
The

401
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,967
The Danelle Garden is probably the most published

402
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
Garden released in the 20th century

403
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,575
Architectural historian Mark Tribe

404
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,647
The garden was designed by Thomas Church

405
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:36,255
A landscape architect who wanted to create outdoor spaces that people would use and love

406
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,583
The title of Thomas churches book was actually

407
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
Gardens are for people

408
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,983
In Garden Surfer people he asked hypothetical clients how much do you really like to guard

409
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,823
If you don't want a garden that you didn't get another Paving makes a lot of sense

410
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:55,455
Church said that Gardens didn't necessarily have to be those traditional rows and rows of

411
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Flowers

412
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,063
And this was a revelation for modern families like the Donald

413
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,415
They wanted a place for parties and relaxing lounging

414
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,975
They wanted their yard to be a piece of

415
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Functional art

416
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
But their kids and dogs

417
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Clamber on

418
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:14,911
The Donnell Garden became the epitome of outdoor California life

419
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
Throughout the 1950s lifestyle

420
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
Sunset

421
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
House beautiful

422
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
Feature the Donnell Garden on there

423
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,175
In many ways it it became the icon

424
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,991
Certainly of American modern landscape

425
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
A lot of it being of

426
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Of course

427
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,831
That's why we're here for the swimming pool

428
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,903
Images of the Danelle Garden began to spread

429
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
Newly-minted suburbanite

430
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
Lacrosse Southern California

431
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
Begin to imitate it

432
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
And West Coast landscape architect

433
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
Text for inspired by its creative use of

434
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
The paving

435
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
And Lawn

436
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
And it's beautiful

437
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,215
Biomorphic

438
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
Kirby pool

439
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:59,199
The pool inspired thousands of imitators and eventually thousands of young skaters in Southern California

440
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,855
Now we can't know for sure exactly where Thomas Church came up with the idea of using the original kidney shape

441
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,439
Retro Boomerang shapes were appearing in everything from fine art

442
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,559
To mass produce textiles and formica Tables by 1947 the shapes we are everywhere

443
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
Another one

444
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
Everything and every

445
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,167
So it's really hard to say

446
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
But

447
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:26,079
There's a really interesting and widespread Terry about where Church got his inspiration for the kidney pool

448
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,383
Skateboarding came to my neighborhood like

449
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
Night at the end of

450
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
1980s

451
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:36,831
We got little bit of flak magazines and videos coming from from the California and seeing

452
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,855
Part 3

453
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
Finland

454
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
Avery Joplin actually went to Finland

455
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Videos

456
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
The skaters in

457
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,351
The first ones came like when some

458
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,143
Shameless dad went to

459
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,471
$60 business trip sisters and then they April

460
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,519
Brought back some videos

461
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,567
Jonas REO grew up in Finland

462
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,127
Watching videos of California skaters

463
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
He caught the bug

464
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
A big way

465
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,735
He started skateboarding

466
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,063
And then became sponsored and started skating in cities all over the world

467
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,647
True skateboarding I fell in love with architecture and Design

468
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,951
Young and went to University and studied architecture

469
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,535
I have more control over the space is he skating

470
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
I'll just like

471
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
Sneak into that business on

472
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:27,263
I won't tell anyone that I'm scared and just make sure that the handrail is scared of the stairs

473
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,567
Have a good give good material

474
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
And Ferb

475
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,943
In architecture school Yana distinctly remembers a lecture he heard

476
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,247
About the origins of the kidney pool

477
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,575
There was a professor coming from California

478
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,415
She was having lecture and talkin about the Donnell Garden

479
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
I think she was saying that it's the

480
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
Mother of all

481
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
Kidney pools

482
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
You know about another kidney

483
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,655
It's actually a grandmother of whirlpools

484
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,447
Finland in middle of Finland

485
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,519
It was designed by an architect and designer

486
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,567
Name all of our Alto

487
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,847
Alan Alda

488
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,383
Where can his life was

489
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,711
Exceptional in that sense that he was a Pioneer in

490
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,991
Cross-disciplinary

491
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
Thinking on that

492
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,831
Design this is Auntie Oliver

493
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,159
An architect and Vice President of aalto University

494
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,464
Which is named after Alvar aalto

495
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
He designed the model

496
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
Furniture

497
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,584
And also he had a flourishing business

498
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,656
Alvar aalto is the man in Finland

499
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,216
Bust of him everywhere

500
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:33,568
He designed a lot of the public and government buildings in meeting halls in Helsinki

501
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,152
Ann Oliver Altos Furniture is in I kid you not

502
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Almost

503
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
Every

504
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
Single

505
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Building

506
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,272
Almost every home has

507
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,832
Samsung design

508
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,416
Also is beloved and venerated Beyond Finland to

509
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:52,256
Frank Lloyd Wright loved Alto and he hated other architects

510
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,864
Frank gehry also cites also is one of the only other Architects that he admires

511
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,936
Alvar aalto Was An Architect architect

512
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,264
At his work helped create a unique finish

513
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
Aesthetic

514
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,336
Which was an important part of developing a unique

515
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
Finnish identity

516
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,176
Because Finland is a relatively young country

517
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,784
Test for about 500 years part of Sweden and then for one

518
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
Yes part of Russia

519
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,648
There are two movie theaters in California that are older than Finland

520
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,232
It was only in 1917 that Finland became independent

521
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
Before that it was Russian

522
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
It looks like it

523
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,424
The architecture in downtown Helsinki is unexpectedly Regal intimidating

524
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,264
The buildings line the streets like towering pastel cakes

525
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
With white ornate

526
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
Trim

527
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,896
Helsinki has stood in for Moscow and Leningrad in a number of films

528
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:47,552
And I at the end of 19th century became very important to create our own national identity and try to

529
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
Get independent

530
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,160
Finland wanted to step away from Soviet romanticism

531
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,744
Especially because the rest of Europe was experimenting with a new

532
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,792
Approach called functionalism

533
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:04,448
Functionalism was a reaction to the dirty nasty polluted cities of the 19th century

534
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,776
Which were loaded down with extra trim and ornaments

535
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
Statues

536
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
Functionalism

537
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,896
Was like an architectural cleanse

538
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:17,248
Functionalist wanted to be a healthy dose of sunlight

539
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,552
Are between buildings in phosphorus

540
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
Think of the sharp lines and

541
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,160
Steel and metal of the German Bauhaus

542
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,488
Are the pristine concrete of Le corbusier

543
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
Functionalism

544
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
Is clean

545
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
DMX

546
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
Stock

547
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Spacious

548
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Modern

549
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,448
And a little sterile

550
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
So

551
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,288
Ulta was influenced by functionalist ideas

552
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,336
Who wanted to humanize them

553
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
Adopting

554
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,176
Discount of international influences

555
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,968
I'm making his own version

556
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
That

557
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
Aldo's architecture was

558
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
Was crisp and functional

559
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
A little more natural

560
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,624
Raw and organic

561
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
And

562
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,208
He did this in part by using a lot of wood

563
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,768
Midwood behave in ways

564
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
Bending and blowing

565
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,864
And you wake this is jonas malmberg

566
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,680
Architect an art historian with the alto Foundation

567
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,984
Where are we you describe where we are

568
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,520
Show Business

569
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
Honda

570
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,336
Also the

571
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
Office

572
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,456
Jonas showed me the legs of some chairs and stools out there had made

573
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:23,552
And talked about Altos patented method for bending and curving wood

574
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
This method allowed also to make

575
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880
Curvy molds

576
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,440
Make these wavy glass vases

577
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
He became famous

578
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,256
Blown in.

579
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Timber Mall

580
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,168
Earthquake at a bit different than any new shapes for a curved made their way into Auto stairways

581
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
And walls and he made

582
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
Curtain partitions to break up space

583
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,848
And he used rounded tiles and undulating countertops

584
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,664
Is it fair to say a lot of the curves he just made cuz he

585
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,248
Could like you figured out how to do it and he was just getting with it

586
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,064
And then he would have wanted

587
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
Toshiba he wanted to buildings

588
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
To be kind of

589
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
Something that you can't really predict

590
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:06,560
So when an art collector and lumbreras nimri gullikson asked alter to design her country home

591
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
Villa mairea

592
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,656
Also wanted to keep it very start and clean

593
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
Loss of a friendly in natural

594
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,520
And we don't have their like any expensive material

595
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
Justin Bieber in the floor

596
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,384
Frederick on the wall we don't have any any

597
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,176
Material that would be posh

598
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,712
But of course in Finland

599
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
If you're going to have a Country Villa

600
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
You're going to have a sauna

601
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
Autoflower finish

602
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,368
Bending two-timing

603
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Peru Countryside

604
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,232
China culture and if you're going to have a sauna

605
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
You need a pool to cool off in

606
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,328
Ann Oliver Alto

607
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,608
Made a pool

608
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
The very curious shape

609
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
Preformance

610
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:49,568
Maybe a sock

611
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
With curly ends

612
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,224
The Story Goes that Thomas Church

613
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,296
The California landscape architect who designed the Danelle Garden

614
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,088
Went on a trip to Finland

615
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,368
With his wife Betsy

616
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
In 1937

617
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,952
Somehow they found out the address

618
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,768
Alvar aalto is home and studio and got themselves

619
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,424
And they just knocked on the door architectural historian Mark try it again when The Story Goes also came out in his bathrobe in it

620
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
Invited them in and Sir Thomas Church and his wife Betsy and Xarelto and its first wife I know all really hit it off

621
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,128
And they got to be good friends

622
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,408
Quite possibly the case

623
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,224
The Altos design for the villa mairea

624
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
And it's Akshay

625
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,552
Pool were displayed in his Studio

626
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
When Thomas Church

627
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
Visiting

628
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,648
Miter was finished in 39

629
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,952
But they were there in 37

630
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,352
Maybe it was on the drawing boards and maybe there was no pool at the time I mean we just just don't know

631
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,888
There's no way to verify

632
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
But that's the

633
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
Story Architects tell

634
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
There's a book about the Donnell Garden

635
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,312
Probably going to have a mention

636
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
The Villa Maria

637
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:58,688
Yeah The Story Goes that Summers Church went back home then it was

638
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
1948 when the Donnell Garden

639
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
Was made

640
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,856
Almost Ten Years After and then the Danelle Garden Pool becomes famous

641
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:11,232
Appearing on magazine covers and inspiring hundreds of imitators across Southern California

642
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,120
And he's hundreds of curvy biomorphic pools get emptied out in the drought in the 1970s

643
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,168
And inspire a whole new skate culture

644
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,032
And that culture-inspired kids around the world like Jana to take up skateboarding

645
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,104
And skateboarding inspired Jana

646
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872
To become

647
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
An architect

648
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
And now

649
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,712
He has a specialty

650
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,296
Yeah I'm going to the skatepark Tucson already feeling

651
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,344
He designs curvaceous pools

652
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
All over Europe

653
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Pools

654
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,952
Exclusively for skating

655
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,792
That's one big pool coming to the Eastside of Helsinki

656
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,352
It it's it's not really nice figurine

657
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
That's something to be proud of

658
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,448
I think when Jana says he's proud

659
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,728
Jeneane's at Publix

660
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,520
Skateparks in skate pools

661
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,568
Should be a source of civic pride

662
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
Especially in Finland

663
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
Where

664
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Ian Alexa

665
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,456
Modern skateboarding

666
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,784
Began I kind of use it as a joke when when we are out

667
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,184
Which skatepark builders that usually from States or Canada and try to claim skateboarding for

668
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,488
Having its roots in Finland

669
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,216
Some say that Oliver Altos pool at the Villa mairea

670
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,544
Was inspired by the soft bends in a Finnish Lake

671
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,896
Or maybe also was just excited about his ability to make wavy forms

672
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,224
Since that kind of became his signature in his furniture and homewares

673
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:42,368
Who knows maybe he was inspired by a some other curvy pool somewhere else in the world that we don't know about

674
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,928
Although didn't like to talk about his inspiration

675
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,232
She didn't write too much about it either

676
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,304
Although only talked about the birth of his ideas

677
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
Anunnaki

678
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
Ended metaphor

679
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
Betta fish

680
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
Manestream

681
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,544
Architecture and its details are in some way all part of biology

682
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
Perhaps they are for instance

683
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,896
Like some big salmon or trout

684
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,944
They're not born fully-grown

685
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,528
They're not even born in the city or water where they normally live

686
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,112
They're born hundreds of miles away from their home grounds

687
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,184
Where the river is narrow to Tiny streams

688
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:22,560
Just as it takes time for a speck of fishpond mature into a fully grown fish

689
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,912
So we need time for everything that develops and crystallizes

690
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,960
You know world of ideas

691
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:45,856
Go farther up

692
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,184

Central route to Andrew Norton

708

Bridge Park in this idea

709
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
The archival sound was

710
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
Vanderbilt University archives

711
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,952
In the 1978 movie skateboard Kings

712
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:59,072
If you haven't seen Stacy's documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys yet I'm actually kind of jealous of

713
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
Really glad you're going to

714
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,168
We are project 91.7 KAAL

715
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
LW in San Francisco and produced

716
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
Radio row

717
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752

Oakland California

720
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,200
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

721
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,784
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

722
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:25,696
If I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis talking to me in my

723
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:30,304
Wife is another word for all hearing.

724
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,096
Technology talk to us

725
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
It is a creation of Sonic trash

726
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,216
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

727
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,800
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

728
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,848
To make them more human

729
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,944
Turn the living room lights on

730
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
Okay

731
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,528
Dim the living room lights to 50

732
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
80%

733
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Okay

734
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:59,488
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

735
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,304
Makes for a much more natural experience

736
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,352
Turn the living room lights on

737
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
Dim the living room lights to 50%
