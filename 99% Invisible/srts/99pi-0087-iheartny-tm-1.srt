By now the story is well-known

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,488
A man sits in the backseat of a cab

29
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
Sketching on a notepad

30
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,816

And an n and a y

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,008
And right away he knows he's got something

This is it

36
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
This is the camp

37
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,920
The man was a designer named Milton Glaser

38
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,248
What city was New York the year 1977

39
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,344
A time and place commemorated by an entire genre of movies

40
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,440
Dedicated to making it look like a terrifying place to live

41
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,256
Enjoy a typical afternoon

42
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
Time in New York City

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
The most

44
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,096
Violent town in the world

45
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
I see the money man

00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,192
The news today

00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
The city needed a miracle

48
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
Any kind of got one

49
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
We letters and

50
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
I

00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
Hyatt

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
And

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,808
Telling story with me is reporter muj

54
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
Sadie Glazier created the design pro bono

55
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
The Empire State development

56
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
Corporation

57
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,744
That's agency that handles tourism for the state of New York

58
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,072
Took the NY actually refers to all of New York State

59
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
Not just the city

60
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
So I Sylvania

61
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,936
Ms logo is literally ever

62
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
T-shirts

63
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Hats towel test

64
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
The bags oven mitt

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
Prolong time

66
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
I didn't realize anyone had

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Designed it

68
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
I didn't like it or dislike it

69
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
Is just part of New York

70
00:02:59,456 --> 00:02:59,968
Of all the

71
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:04,320
Pronoun verb noun combinations that have ever been turned into a piece of visual design

72
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
I love New York is a pretty good one

73
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,464
I'll guess that there's not a single person out there and listen land

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Who needs a description

75
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
I do not have to tell you

76
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,096
So you're talking about a 2 by 2 grid

77
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,656
The letters in a typeface with a friendly serif

78
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Conjoined

79
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,216
A plump red heart

80
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,800
Both New York city and state have their own official flag

81
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
With a heart logo may as well be it

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
And like any good flag

83
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,712
The logo can inspire a sense of civic pride

84
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
I remember

85
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,600
The first time I bought and I heart New York shirt was actually a couple days after 9/11

86
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
I was living in Brooklyn and I was on my way to work and saw the towers you know exploding and

87
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
After

88
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,816
That experience

89
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,376
Your first your first thought is

90
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
How can I show the city that I love it

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,984
And of course the first thing that comes to your mind is this

92
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
Is beautiful

93
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
Piece of art

94
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,944
That says I heart New York and so I went down to Chinatown and I bought a shirt and I'm pretty sure it was probably not an official

95
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,344
Officially licensed product but it was $5 and I put it on I wore it until it smell bad and it helped me feel better

96
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
I Love NY campaign

97
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,256
Is that it was so successful that it became part of the built environment

98
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,351
So people started doing with I Love NY the same thing to humans

99
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
Have always done

100
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,167
When encountering something in nature

101
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
Distorted image

102
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,311
My name is Brian and I make plush internal organs

103
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
For my company I hergotz

104
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,943
Wendy runs I heart guts out of her home in Takoma Park Maryland

105
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,247
She makes is anatomically correct

106
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Plush dolls

107
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Internal organ

108
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,391
Kidneys please prostates your eyeball with faces full of joy

109
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
When he started I heart guts back in 2005

110
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
A t-shirt

111
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
The doll didn't come until later

112
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,607
And once you're within the style of I Love NY

113
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,447
Which Wendy knew was not totally groundbreaking material

114
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
UCI Orange New York on the Tropicana ads you see t-shirts that say I stomach

115
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
LA or

116
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,967
I spayed my cat like clubs diamonds Hearts Spades

117
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
Danny White UCF

118
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,807
You know rip offs of this iconic

119
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,367
Graphic design absolutely everywhere

120
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
Now Wendy is a huge

121
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,487
Is the guy who created I love him

122
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,399
He's a genius he's a brilliant graphic designer you go on SC there's about a billion different I heart New York Ripper

123
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:30,751
And nobody ever says that Milton Glaser the one who designed it

124
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,799
So I wanted to give the man credit

125
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
Where credit is due

126
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
So on her website

127
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,431
Keep it up a note right next to the teacher that called it a quote

128
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,527
Unmute eBay sammelan Glazer's iconic I heart NY.

129
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:47,647
Few months later actually on my birthday and July 8th 2008

130
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:54,047
Your birthday it was my birthday I got a cease-and-desist letter that said that I was infringing on

131
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
I heart New York

132
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Trademark

133
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,679
With my design and could I please destroy all the shirts and take them down to the website

134
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,751
So I was completely freaked out

135
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
I heart New York

136
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,383
I really I love New York is intellectual property owned by New York State

137
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,223
You can't just rif on it with your own design and sell it without paying for it

138
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
Wendy made some alterations to the merchandise in question

139
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:20,415
Like cutting the design out of the shirt and sewing it back onto another shirt upside down and off center

140
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
The difference between an I heart guts shirt

141
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,279
And I are just New York Tropicana ad

142
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,095
Is that Tropicana paid for the rights to use it

143
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Most likely

144
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:34,495
It's hard to get details on specific legal agreements but for the most part if you don't pay and you get caught

145
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
You get a cease-and-desist letter

146
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Ignoring

147
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
You got a lawsuit on your

148
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
No as far as cease-and-desist letters go Wendy said this one was really sweet I'm looking at this you know

149
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,391
Scary season scattered all over the page

150
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,463
Ironically it may have been the shout-out to Milton Glaser

151
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,999
The. Wendy in trouble

152
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,559
Or at least she think so there's really no way to tell

153
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,887
I figured that they probably have legal spider robots that are

154
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,519
We searching for Search terms like Milton Glaser or I heart New York or I love New York

155
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
We do Google searches

156
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,455
And we receive Google Alerts I mean I don't think any of this information is very groundbreaking that's clear

157
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,855
My name is Claire Newman and I am an IP licensing executive and legal counsel for CMG worldwide

158
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,951
And we represent the New York State Department of Economic Development

159
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,279
Who is the proprietor and owner of the iHeart

160
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
NY train

161
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
Says iHeart not I love

162
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,959
It is actually I love I can't believe I messed up yeah it's I love New York

163
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
CMG handles intellectual property licensing

164
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,335
Sing for according to the website

165
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,175
Celebratory individuals from then now and forever

166
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
They represent the estate

167
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
Amelia Earhart Malcolm X

168
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
Frank Lloyd Wright

169
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
And a bunch of other famous dead people

170
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,671
And of course I love New York which Claire Newman represents from her office in Indianapolis

171
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,767
Claire says about half of her workload is related to licensing I love him

172
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
Adjust the number of colleagues who work on it too

173
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:10,239
Note to clear it wasn't clear who sent Wendy the cease-and-desist letter that happened before Claire was working with CMG

174
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
Her office works with interested vendors like

175
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
Blank t shirt manufacturers

176
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
Is the license the logo as is

177
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:19,199
Or a company can pay the remix the Loco by Tropicana did

178
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
With IRA

179
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
NY

180
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,087
Claire looks for infringement on sites like Etsy Polyvore and pint

181
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,647
She says people even report infringement

182
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
50 mg

183
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
I sometimes

184
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
She just stumbles into

185
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:37,119
Like today for example Cruise Line

186
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,423
Infringement inside the letter O is

187
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:46,079
Really coincidental but you know we found it

188
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Said she couldn't talk

189
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,711
Her job at CMG is about protecting artists and their says it intellectual property

190
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
Is a protecting consumers to

191
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,087
Do you know if you buy McDonald's french fries

192
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
You know you're getting

193
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,439
McDonald's french fries you're not getting Burger King Spa

194
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
French fries

195
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
And so if you started

196
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,327
Putting different french fries in the McDonald's containers

197
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,727
That trademark that is the trademark on the container would stop indicating the source and origin of

198
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
Does french fries so

199
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
The reason people

200
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
Usually marks is so that

201
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
They can go back

202
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,663
Two trusted Brands and trusted

203
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Labels

204
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:27,295
And I know they're getting the same standard in the same type of product each time

205
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:32,415
What is TMG is saying that and I heart guts t-shirt it's too close to the Glazer design

206
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
I got to wondering

207
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
How close is

208
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Is 2 closed

209
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
I want to play a game

210
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,095
Basically I'm just going to give you

211
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
Potential logos

212
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,239
Like whether or not I would think that they would be an infringement

213
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Okay

214
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
Let's say you saw my stomach

215
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Stomach

216
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
I guess I would say yes

217
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
I bike Melbourne eye and then a bicycle and

218
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
I mean

219
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
I guess I guess

220
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,719
I would have to see it it's all about like the design and like what the visual is invoking

221
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,559
CMG is Vigilant about trademark protection because they have to be

222
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,887
The way the law works is that if you don't defend your trademark well enough

223
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
You can lose it

224
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,727
So you think someone is ripping off work that you've tried more

225
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
And you try to sue them

226
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,591
If they can prove that you've done a bad job enforcing that trademark in the past

227
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
I just want to study with them

228
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,991
So it's cmg's job to err on the side of thinking that something is an infringement

229
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
My position is that everything is a nymph

230
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,415
Wait why because it's my job to protect the mark

231
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
So just because Claire thinks something is infringement it doesn't always mean there's a cease-and-desist letter in the mail from CMG

232
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:47,679
They send out about 200 I Love NY related cease-and-desist for year

233
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,031
Ironically one of the people to receive such a letter with Milton Glaser

234
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Who remember

235
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,639
Did the original I Love NY design for free

236
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
2001

237
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,503
Right after 9/11 in an effort to raise money for local New York charities

238
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,087
Glazier created a new modified design that red

239
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,391
I Love NY more than ever

240
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,255
The state of New York land of apologizing to Glaser and chalked it up to a bureaucratic misunderstanding

241
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,887
Now we can go back and forth about whether or not this indicates something is broken and trademark law

242
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
Really the more interesting question is

243
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,543
Why does CMG eat a whole team of people working on I Love NY

244
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,943
I mean who would have thought that a government ad campaign from the 70s we need to be defended by a team of lawyers

245
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,295
I'm getting stolen and we mixed and modified in the countless permutations

246
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
I don't get it

247
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
I just

248
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,951
Totally don't understand that I have done a lot of things that are persistent

249
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
In the culture

250
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
It all started last

251
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
S560

252
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Nothing like this

253
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
That doesn't make any sense at all

254
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
And you can probably guess who this

255
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,239
My name is William gleyzerman designer

256
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,103
And I spend my day pushing things around until they look good

257
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
That's what I do

258
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,687
It was clear from the beginning of our conversation

259
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
That Milton Glaser is

260
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
Really over talking about I love

261
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
And why

262
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,831
He's done a ton of other work

263
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,415
He didn't iconic Bob Dylan poster in Philip Roth book covers

264
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,719
He co-founded New York Magazine

265
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,535
And the 84 years old he's still working

266
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,887
Just recently he designed entire visual identity for Brooklyn Brewery

267
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
It for all his expertise as a designer

268
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
Even she doesn't understand the success of I Love NY

269
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,871
I would have thought it would have lost meaning a long time ago in fact I thought

270
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
Better would be a 6 month campaign

271
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
I felt that

272
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,527
In 77 it would probably less

273
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
6 watts should I be done with it

274
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,159
And then when I went through 77 and 78 I thought well

275
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,511
Maybe it has another six months ago and then went to the 78 and 79

276
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
Here we are

277
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
After

278
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,935
So many decades and it's still persist I can't believe it

279
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
I mean

280
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
There is no doubt that

281
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,823
I will go out into the street today

282
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,895
And I will see half a dozen versions of it

283
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,479
If you go down to Chinatown every building

284
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,015
Every street every

285
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
Side of a wall

286
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Is covered

287
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
With I love New York

288
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,927
They are far more I love New York

289
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
Dumplings in Chinatown

290
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Why

291
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
Why does it persist

292
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
I wish I could

293
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
Why isn't it tired

294
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
Everything is tired

295
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,775
Maybe I love New York is still around

296
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
Because people just love New York

297
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,431
But Milton Glaser thinks that its success that has less to do with what the designer

298
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Represents

299
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
And more with what it is

300
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,063
You know I think it it really is has more to do with the

301
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,391
Trulia real brain function that has any kind of logic

302
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,463
It has something to do with the rigidity of that letter for

303
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,279
At the attempt of the grid to contain

304
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,583
The erotic nature of

305
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
The heart

306
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
The something that

307
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
Create an active

308
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
Closure and Pitbull

309
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
Mainz when they see it

310
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,079
That they want repeat it that doesn't

311
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
Board them

312
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
They can look at it at thousand

313
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
What's the time

314
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,735
A hundred thousand times and still nothing I've had enough

315
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
It's a trivial mystery

316
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
But baby. Baby it's a profound mystery

317
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,183
Why people are willing to look at certain things

318
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,511
Over and over and over and over

319
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
I mean

320
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,119
This is show a. Della Francesca

321
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
The frick

322
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
This week

323
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
I'm going to try to go up to

324
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
Today I don't think

325
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Piero

326
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
I love you

327
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
Why am I willing

328
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
To look at the same

329
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
Pair of teeth

330
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
And the way they cling

331
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
To the ground

332
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Depiero

333
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
Lower the feet

334
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
The painting

335
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
Can make me pay attention

336
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Put that floor

337
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
For my whole life I've been looking at that same pair of

338
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,047
And I'll be looking at it till the day I die

339
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
With astonished

340
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Why

341
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,031
Well maybe it'd be on the I Love New York at the phrase and they

342
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
Meaning to the city

343
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
They are simply the mystery of

344
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Forum

345
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
Why does assert

347
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
That is certain

348
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
Color in a circle

349
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271

Something about all of this stuff

You never get

364
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,111
Maybe the I Love NY design continues to hold our attention

365
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,671
Because of its infinite capacity for remix

366
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,255
Then you can substitute literally any part of the equation

367
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
The eye the heart the NY

368
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,863
And the cultural reference still comes across

369
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,679
Exact even York state is doing good

370
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,495

373
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,895
It is now easier than ever before in human history

374
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
To take something

375
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,479
And change it just enough to make it your own

376
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:27,135
Imitating an altering Andre mixing has always been the way that humans engaged with the world

377
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
But there's a limit here

378
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:34,047
It will always be a baseline need for new ideas to break free of what's been done

379
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,095
And say something truly original

380
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
And should you ever fall short of the mark

381
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Somewhere Out There

382
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Is a cease-and-desist letter

383
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519

Wendy Bryan from I heart guts

387

Says that there's a silver lining to getting that cease-and-desist letter from CMG

388
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,679
The language was obviously very frightening mean

389
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:16,031
Will not be tolerated immediate season 2 sister will be feet

390
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:22,431
So terrifying right and but later on I actually was able to use the language from the cease-and-desist to

391
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,015
Send out my own skis and assist two people were ripping off my stuff

392
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:33,183
I'm not the only person who put a happy face on an organ and I don't claim to be

393
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,023
Do you have to use different colors and different shapes and you have to come up with your own idea

394
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
