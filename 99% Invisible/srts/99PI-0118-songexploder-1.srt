I'm Roman Mars

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,664
Hrishikesh hirway has a podcast called song Exploder the concept is simple but

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,064
Brilliant I ask musicians to take apart one of their songs and go through it piece by piece and

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
What listeners hear what's going on inside some of the tracks and reveal the secrets

Of

34
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,048
What went into making the song whether it's

35
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,352
The Sounds inside of it or just

36
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,448
Memories of what they were going through

37
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
When they were creating song

38
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:58,272
Palms are sweaty

39
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,112
I don't think she would mind me saying but it's

40
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,904

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
On the very first episode of song Exploder Richie interview Jimmy tamborello of the band Postal Service

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,248
Invited him to take a deep dive into each individual element of the song

45
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,552
The district sleeps alone tonight

46
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:36,416
If the song is playing mind me now if you don't already own the loan Postal Service album

47
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,720
You made some poor choices in life

48
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
I'm serious

49
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:45,376
Anyway this is Jimmy tamborello isolating the backing Vocal Track sung by Jenny Lewis

50
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
So here's some of

51
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,704
Jenny's background vocals solo.

52
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,160
So Timber Ella was looking to add more texture to the Final Mix the song

53
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,464
Any had these beautiful backing vocals

54
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,536
It might have been just an accident with a delay pedal but

55
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,328
Lips a little bit of Chinese vocals

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
And made into

57
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,168
Texture in the Sun as one of the last things

58
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
That we put into that into the district

59
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
Play that part

60
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,040
This vocal Loop comes in after the second verse when it's kind of going into the

61
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
More Dancy Down trailer

62
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,536
Here's her schedule away from song Exploder again

63
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,864
I'd heard that song The District sleeps alone tonight I mean

64
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
So many times since it came out in 2003

65
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,520
I knew that part and I knew that sound I have no idea

66
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
But that was a

67
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Human voice

68
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,872
Making that sound until he took everything away

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,248
And that was the first episode that was for like the pilot before the show is called

70
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,808
Song Exploder before when I was closer to figuring it out

71
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,136
And when Jimmy play that part I was like oh this is it this is

72
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,440
This is the reason why I want to do the show

73
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,256
And a radio show was born

74
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
Podcast whatever

75
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,863
As opposed to like a magic

76
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,679
Trick where the intention is to

77
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
Fool the audience

78
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
You thinking that

79
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
Their experience is something that they aren't

80
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,359
If you're learning all the secrets of a song

81
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,407
The idea is still too dress

82
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
Create a musical experience for you that you enjoy

83
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
And

84
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,855
I feel like you'd like to know more about it then you can have a richer enjoyment of it at least that's

85
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
How it is for me

86
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
So say we all

87
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,911
Today we're going to feature a recent episode of song Exploder all about the theme song to the Netflix original series

88
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
House of Cards

89
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,031
This is one of my favorite episodes because it reveals so much

90
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,103
About all the thought that goes into making a theme song

91
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
Turn TV show

92
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:10,527
She spoke to the composer Jeff Beal and his home in Los Angeles and he describes his collaboration with

93
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
Series executive producers David Fincher and Beau willimon

94
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
How they established

95
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,183
Tone and musical palette of the show

96
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,303
And how the music theme change from season 1 to season 2 even notice

97
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Turn off go back

98
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
Indifferent

99
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
You currently during the season 1 version

100
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,495
By the way there's a House of Cards season 1 spoilers ahead

101
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
So you've been warned

102
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
Here is composer Jeff Beal

103
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,639
Talking to her skate Shaarawy

104
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
On song exploder

105
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
I'm Jeff Beal

106
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,927
Composer I do the music for House of Cards

107
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,743
I had worked with David Fincher on a commercial

108
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Probably about 6

109
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
Six or seven years ago

110
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,375
This was around the time I have been working on Rome

111
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
HBO

112
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
So I saw the trades you know this show is happening with David's name attached and I kept in touch and we never worked together since and I thought this might be

113
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
Good match for us you know

114
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:14,015
Bad watch little bit of the British show and that was something that's part of my pitch to David is that cuz I saw her use the wrong thing I said well I said

115
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,831
Even around with a. Rama was very much about politics

116
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,927
Operatic scale cast and storytelling

117
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:26,815
After I first met with David disorder talk about the project and got his initial thoughts about music makes or put our heads together

118
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
Based on his sort of

119
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,959
Way of thinking about music and how much music informs his choices he actually asked me to write some sketches

120
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
Before he started shooting at a course before

121
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:39,615
We had the meeting or before I wrote this sketches they shared with me I think about four or five Scripts

122
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
Early drafts of what became season 1

123
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,575
So it was very much and Bose both sense of language in the way he sort of created this world that inspired

124
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
Some of the early early work

125
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,951
The thing I like about the British show with his sword dark humor to it

126
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,607
And I said yeah did the music definitely have to find a way to sort of give the audience permission to sort of the laugh the sardonic

127
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,911
Darkness once he

128
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,311
Call me and you know he gave me some of his thoughts on it which were interesting and some of the surprising to me she was one song you really like

129
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
Like the Supertramp

130
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
Crime of the century

131
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
Great song

132
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,855
The section of that song towards the end where

133
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
It just becomes a sort of driving

134
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Kiest

135
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Had to send some sort of

136
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,215
Operatic for a classism in and

137
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,263
Sort of Gravitas but

138
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
But it also had a very gritty

139
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,639
Birthday almost Jazzy or bluesy

140
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:51,295
Transportation of rock and roll

141
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,847
We knows we distracted that together and sort of thought about why that spoke to him

142
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
That's the show the show is

143
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,711
It's all about the underbelly of Washington

144
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,527
The dark Corners what you don't see and what really happens

145
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,599
Supposed to sort of The West Wing you know heroic

146
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
More aspirational

147
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,279
The storm Hail to the Chief you know Washington than your typical sort of the film score gestures about the capital and Pollock

148
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
I wrote about for sketches

149
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
For David

150
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,543
One of the things we talked about in our first meeting you was he said was we kind of need a call to Arms

151
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
And when you listen to it

152
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,935
It has a lot of the elements that became the main title theme it's got that bass line it's got that sort of cloud dark Electro

153
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
Proceed at like a

154
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
Like a fog or something

155
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:20,639
And the tune is there although in this case it was displayed by the piano very simple orchestration

156
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,711
And then just in the second time it goes around the snare drum comes in

157
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,135
Very simple but there's a tune in there there's a little sequences

158
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
Of chords and Melody

159
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,791
Part of the reason sketching is useful is because it's like the bones of something

160
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,607
If the structure of the skeleton is it has integrity

161
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,655
It should be able to stand without

162
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,727
An abundance of sort of instrumental

163
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Embellishment

164
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,847
And so by sketching and by doing Simple versus themes

165
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,919
You are able to sort of make sure that you have an idea

166
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,807
I always thought of this is sort of the Puppet Master theme the idea that like

167
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
Kevin Spacey's character is

168
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,207
Serta manipulator who's a virtuoso at pulling the strings on people and getting them

169
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
Do what he wants them to do

170
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,839
But the reason I'm sharing this one in the context of the main title is

171
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:17,215
When we got around to finally doing the arrangement David said he would be cool if the main title felt like the sort of

172
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
Stu

173
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
A lot of different elements from the score

174
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,663
Which would then be deconstructed into its individual parts

175
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,271
So you'll hear this sort of descending chromatic line in the high piano

176
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
That became

177
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,367
One of the signature the main title sequence

178
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:40,767
As-built sketch grows the electric bass comes in

179
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,607
So it's the sort of

180
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:51,263
Homeless piano Motif by putting that bass underrated sort of gave it at attention of something that's pushing against it

181
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:58,943
Dave and I talked about the piano little bit cuz I was in the Supertramp q&c instrument I like a Laden

182
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:05,599
It felt like a good instrument for Kevin's character because it can be very precise and very

183
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,391
Through mechanical in a way

184
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Which I love about it

185
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:17,119
Those are called arms things that was dropped into the main title sequence and it never left once it was in there that was what we're going to do

186
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,447
And I started you know if you passes through

187
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,239
I start to work on the arrangement

188
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
The story of the main title sequences visually

189
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:30,431
Lyric on flowing but then I remember this came straight from sort of those original scripting of the main title

190
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,551
Just basically the whole idea of the sun going down in Washington uni started in really broad daylight

191
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
And as a sequence

192
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
Progressives you end up at night

193
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:45,535
So you so there was a way in which you went from something very open and and Airy and light just like the.

194
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
Darkness falling

195
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,191
So that was that was a little bit of a visual storytelling thing I tried to play off of

196
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,519
The first thing we hear is the fog the fog of

197
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:01,919
The Cloud of Doom it's this is sort of low since Brown

198
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:08,319
Shortly after that comes the Baseline

199
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,719
Which I know David affectionately referred to as the riptide I was like that describes

200
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:21,119
It's kind of like the idea of something that pulls you under basically a combination of several things it's

201
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:27,519
Analog e model 10 things that I designed some of my head for a long time and it's a couple different

202
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,919
Playing the part

203
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:40,319
Who is a Wonderful Young musician he's actually Now setting jazz bass

204
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:46,719
Patient with getting big enough I actually recorded the bass an octave above it gives it enough Midway contents so that when all this other stuff

205
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,839
Is happening at basic still driving one of the fun things about the composition for me with that

206
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
The harmony change is a lot over that bass line in fact bass is always playing in a minor but the harmony sometimes goes to a major

207
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,847
Can I create this very strange dissonance

208
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:09,247
Innocence of collision

209
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
I know because it's ingrained it's got its own logic to it so much like Frank will push through anything he doesn't care he's not going to

210
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,999
Stop playing those notes

211
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:27,935
My original sort of call the arm sketch two times through which is kind of the original demo with almost long enough to cover the main title sequence

212
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
I need some more time

213
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,543
And I also had this direction from David to sort of work in another theme

214
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,151
So what I did was I kind of extended the intro I had a lot of percussion

215
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:41,759
But I also added that little Puppetmaster Rip but did you know that thing

216
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
It has a slightly different

217
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,647
Cadence because this isn't for 4 in the master theme of those in three

218
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:55,071
Prices are broken up a little bit but it's sort of it's still got that descending chromatic line

219
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:00,959
Another layer that was sort of one of the last things I came up with but was really useful as the trumpet

220
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
McLaren

221
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,335
Again it's the most

222
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:11,199
Expected cliche thing you here in old show about Washington would be that sort of

223
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,759
Military trumpet kind of thing

224
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
Because we're seeing

225
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
The sort of iconic shots of Washington

226
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:26,815
It just felt right to have something that references that icon cuz obviously the rest of the composition is telling you that this isn't the heroic

227
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:33,215
Version of the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument and there's a way in which is sort of lonely too me too I like this riddle

228
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Loneliness

229
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,871
One of the things David visually did

230
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
Was to pull out

231
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,223
A lot of the people in some of the time-lapse shots he has

232
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,063
It was much creepier seeing some of those shots with no people in them

233
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:52,415
They just made it feel like he was a ghost town or was that the sorcerer real

234
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Quality to it

235
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,071
Basically in talking to David Fincher

236
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
About the second season

237
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,399
That was a sort of surprising to me but

238
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
If we were spotting the first couple episodes YouTube

239
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,775
Guitar to give me notes on the main title that what he wanted different

240
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:12,127
You know David saw the second season is even more operatic and darker to which is

241
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Shocking meager

242
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
The first season was pretty dark

243
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
You seen who who Frank is and what he can do you know in these killed somebody in the first season I mean

244
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,695
Obviously very nothing's going to get in the way of what this guy wants to do

245
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,535
In general for main titles you know people get attached to push when they like something

246
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,607
Does very careful you know to like steer the ship enough

247
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:38,239
But not so far as to make it feel like your old friend was not your friend anymore so

248
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,567
I added some voices some voice samples to a lot of it

249
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
I also added some some low strings

250
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
To the intro

251
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:04,607
The high string line that used to be in the Celli

252
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
2 Gannett slower everything sort of

253
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
Skewing Downs doing darker

254
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
Insulate It Feels Like This Cloud is sort of

255
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
Come over the whole thing

256
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
The sort of lightness and

257
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:26,111
Sense of that type of energy is dissipated you know he's no longer the Puppet Master return to the vice-president season 2 we know he's

258
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,975
He's very much in command so there's less of a game going on and much more of a

259
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
It's it's like you sent to the phone

260
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,799
I think somebody networks or even the filmmakers are afraid of a real main title sequence a servant old-fashioned idea but the whole idea of a

261
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,383
A little mini film that settles you into a world and get you ready

262
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,943
To experience something is a wonderful sort of a

263
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
Storytelling device

264
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,319
You know it's sort of frames a moment for you and gets you settled into

265
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
What you're about to take in

266
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,671
Now here's the season 2 version

267
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
The main title

268
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,159
That would song exploder

281
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
Between the beats

282
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
Bongs and chatter of our devices

283
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,223
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

284
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,855
If I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

285
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:15,743
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remedy for all hearing that voice

286
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
Technology talk

287
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
It is a creation of Sonic trap

288
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,655
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

289
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:26,239
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

290
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
To make them more human

291
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
Turn the living room lights on

292
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Okay

293
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
Dim the living room lights to 50

294
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
80%

295
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Okay

296
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:44,927
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

297
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,975
Makes for a much more natural

298
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
Experience

299
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
Turn the living room lights on

300
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Dim the living room lights

301
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887

311
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
It's not that bad

312
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,328
You take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine

313
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
Thinking about it all the time

314
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,752

Jacked play superhero in a movie

340
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,384
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

Being honest

346
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

347
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,792
A few days ago Wesley Stern

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Now

00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
I need to

354
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
Clear my name

355
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,552
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do what

356
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,600
Whatever it takes to find them

357
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:29,280
