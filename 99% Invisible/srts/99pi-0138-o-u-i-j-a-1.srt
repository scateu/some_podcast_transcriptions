This is our special Halloween episode so I'm going to turn up a little bit of this

27
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
Little of this

28
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,448
Just to get us in the mood

29
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,520
I want to hear hear some buns

All right

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,784
A couple of weekends ago the whole 99 Pi team got together to do something none of us had done since we were 13

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,368
Matt slumber parties

34
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:10,048
And it basically sounds exactly like it did when we were 13 at slumber parties

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Who's there

36
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,008
That night at my house we turned out all the lights

37
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,544
Unlit candles

38
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
An attempted to

39
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
Summon the spirit world

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
With the Ouija board

41
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,992
That's producer Katie mingle she was our host that evening

42
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Fingers on it

43
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:36,160
We were using a homemade board that Avery designed in the style of a store-bought Ouija board

44
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,488
2R throes of letters the top row a through m

45
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
The second row in druzy

46
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
Enable of the letters

47
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
A straight row

48
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
Of all the single digit numbers

49
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:50,752
And then of course yes and no in the upper left and right Corners respectively

50
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,312
And goodbye at the bottom of the board

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,872
The way we just supposed to work

52
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,456
Is participants usually to those sometimes more

53
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504
Ask a question to the

54
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
The spirits

55
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,648
And then they the participants lightly rest their fingers on a planchette

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
Which is the pointer that

57
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
Slides around the board

58
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
And you're not supposed

59
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Push the play

60
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Planchette

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
Supposed to allow the spirit

62
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,472
Guided around the board indicating what letters or words

63
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
There's something

64
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
Communicate

65
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
Equ

66
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,712
The Ouija board is so simple and iconic and it looks

67
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,760
Look at comes from another time

68
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,064
Like it has a real history would it turns out

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,856
Is more than just good design

70
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,672
People have been gathering around a board like this one

71
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,976
For about 130 years

72
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,048
Hi my name is Robert murch

73
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
Most people call me merch

74
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,680
And I'm considered the world's foremost expert on WeChat and talking board

75
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,544
Merch also collects boards and all sorts of other Ouija related artifacts

76
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
So the stuff is everywhere

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,944
You know I I befriend things that the arrangement I have with my husband

78
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,224
When is that

79
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,784
I can only put things on the wall

80
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
That can be friend

81
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,856
Now what you need that agreement

82
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
She didn't realize that I

83
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
Frame anything

84
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah that was unfortunate for him

85
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,071
Merge cells to understand we're talking boards

86
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Came from

87
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
Degenerate

88
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Keyboards

89
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
If you go back to the middle of the 1800

90
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
The three sisters

91
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
In New York

92
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
The fox sisters

93
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
Dr Ringwood

94
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
Starts at 6

95
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Explosion

96
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,479
Mediumship in spiritualism in America and Beyond

97
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,807
The fox sisters claim to be mediums to the spirit world

98
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:45,951
Public demonstrations they would ask questions of the spirits and receive audible Knox back on the wall

99
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,023
Knox that they translated into letters of the alphabet

100
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
The fox

101
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
Sisters worth it

102
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,631
It was a most visible faces of

103
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
A growing movement known as spiritualism

104
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
Which Hobbit spirits of the Dead

105
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Maybe contact

106
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
By the living

107
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,335
And that they had secret knowledge to impart

108
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:07,711
When tales of the fox sisters swept through American newspapers more and more

109
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
Started to believe

110
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,623
During and after the Civil War spiritualism became even more important to people

111
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,975
Everyone had you know where there was a father a son grandfather and uncle

112
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,559
They all lost somebody people just one way

113
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
And you didn't come back

114
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Show

115
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
What else you going to do

116
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
You know you turn to

117
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,519
Trying a contact with these people who are gone

118
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
An 1886

119
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
The fledgling associated

120
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
Press read an article in papers

121
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
All over the country

122
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
About these new talking board

123
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
It's coming out of the spiritualist movement

124
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
In Ohio

125
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:50,207
It's unclear whether he read the article but a few years later and 1890 a businessman named Charles Kennard

126
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
Baltimore Maryland

127
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,559
Realize this talking board could make him lots

128
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
And lots of money

129
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
Cunard pull together a small group of investors

130
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,775
Inform the Kennard Novelty Company to exclusively make and Market talking boards

131
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
Contrary to popular belief

132
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,943
The name weija is not a combination of the French and German words for yes

133
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
We India

134
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,783
Which says that according to document

135
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,599
It's belonging to the original founders of the company

136
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,695
They sat down and asked the board itself what it wanted to

137
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,047
And letter-by-letter it spells out o u i j a

138
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
And when they ask the board

139
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
What that means

140
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
The board spells out

141
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
Good luck

142
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
They called the board Ouija

143
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
The Egyptian Blackboard

144
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,079
They added Egyptian just for a little

145
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
Exotics lair

146
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,199
The patented Ouija board looked a lot like

147
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,271
The talking boards that came out of the spiritualist movement

148
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,855
The only real substantial change was that the Ouija board

149
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,415
The letters of the alphabet in a double art

150
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
Instead of two straight lines

151
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Ross

152
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,631
There have been a few small design changes since the early boards for example there was once a full moon and a crescent

153
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,447
The moon in the top left and right hand corner

154
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,287
Eventually the full moon became a sun which is what you see now

155
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
But through the years

156
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,639
The brand has always been very identifiable

157
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
Anyone who looked at it with no okay that's it

158
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,623
Buy 1893 Charles Kennard have left the company

159
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,927
And it was taken over by William fault

160
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
Who has come to be known as

161
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Father

162
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
A WeChat

163
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,863
Folds New York Times obituary actually credited him with inventing the board

164
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
He did not do

165
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
But he was incredibly good at selling it

166
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,031
Instead of being a straight-up evangelist for the boards

167
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,335
Keep report to be one of the Skeptics

168
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,687
He would say I don't believe in the Ouija board jarno spiritualist

169
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
I'm a presbyterian

170
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
At the same time

171
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
Same interview he would say

172
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,855
But we lost the ship and a Ouija boards

173
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
On the train tracks and we asked the board where

174
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,743
They were and it told us and then they went down that track in

175
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
And sure enough they found

176
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
The train has derailed

177
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
And we found all our boards

178
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,679
Whether the board works and how it works

179
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,263
Whether it was just a game or more serious spiritual tool

180
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
Was something fold kept

181
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
Intentionally mysterious

182
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,895
And this marketing strategy

183
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
Was extremely

184
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
Did everyone have one

185
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,783
People played at home with their families

186
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
Ladies played at tea parties

187
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
In fact one of the boards and Merchants

188
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
Collection doubles as a tea tray

189
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
People even play with their little kids

190
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
Which might seem kind of weird now

191
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:39,935
Fast forward a couple of decades around 1920 and we just still good clean family fun

192
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
And

193
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
It turned out

194
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
It was also a great thing to do on a date

195
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,639
So you're coming out of Victorian times when men and women are not supposed to be alone together

196
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,455
Are there supposed to be in the dark together they're not supposed

197
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
Touching

198
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,551
The original Ouija board would be placed on

199
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Go out

200
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
Your name should be touching

201
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,671
Your fingers will be touching on the plane chat

202
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
You know you want it

203
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
By candlelight

204
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,791
You can see really quickly

205
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
That's the directions

206
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Add in

207
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
You know

208
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,447
Two people a man and a woman prefer

209
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,567
And if you need proof of what a normal part of Americana the Ouija board was

210
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,151
Look no further than the king of Americana himself

211
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
Norman Rockwell

212
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:28,063
In 1920 he made a painting of a man and a woman in the position merch just described

213
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,647
Knees touching he looking flirtatiously at her

214
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
A Ouija board

215
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
Resting in their laps

216
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
Of course we just always had a few naysayers

217
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:49,055
It's some of the first and loudest were actually the people whose jobs these talking boards had just stolen

218
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,615
We see mediums actually saying

219
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
These things are dangerous

220
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,759
You don't know what kind of doors are opening

221
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
You need someone like me who's it

222
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,367
Experience to guide you through this Unseen World

223
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
Now why would they say that

224
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Well because it's

225
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:12,095
Cutting into their profession their money on The Fringe through the years

226
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:17,471
Oh sure they'd be the occasional the Ouija board told me to do it murder that would make it into the news

227
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,031
But they were few and far between

228
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,639
Throughout the decades we do mostly held onto it's wholesome reputation

229
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
The Exorcist

230
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,951
Released in 1973 I had to sleep in my

231
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Trans bedroom

232
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
For a week

233
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,767
After I saw this

234
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
The kid

235
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
At the beginning of the movie the main character's mother.

236
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
Discovers she's been playing with

237
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
A Ouija board

238
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,847
The Exorcist is really the first

239
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Big

240
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Medium

241
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
That

242
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,271
Infers that playing on keyboard by yourself

243
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
Could lead to demonic possession

244
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,159
The following year saw the Ouija board denounced by religious groups

245
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,231
As Satan's preferred method of communication

246
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
Ouija boards are harmless

247
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
Seances are harmless

248
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:21,727
Don't be playing games on Halloween don't call on demons because they'll come and live with you

249
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:26,079
The Bible says he who seeks evil evil will come to him

250
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
Pat Robertson is pretty extreme

251
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,759
But still the image of the board changed a lot since that Norman Rockwell painting in 1920

252
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
Parker Brothers and later Hasbro which acquired Park

253
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
Brothers in 1991

254
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
Still sells a lot of boards

255
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,231
But the reason people buy them has changed

256
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,279
It's not good clean family fun anymore

257
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
Now people buy them

258
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Because they want to get

259
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Scared

260
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:54,751
There's another Ouija movie just released called weijia which will do nothing to change the board sensor reputation

261
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:01,151
Funny faces doing

262
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,455
Spell Hi friend

263
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,807
This is freaking me out I'm done

264
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
But it's Sinister reputation is

265
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:15,231
Fine with Hasbro in fact they put up a lot of the money for that new Ouija movie

266
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
They've also released a new version of the game

267
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Unchanged the tagline

268
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Which used to be

269
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
It's just a game

270
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
Isn't it the new tagline

271
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
Do not play the Ouija board

272
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,663
The design is different to very long time the Ouija board

273
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Got a makeover

274
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
Baby I did a couple of modern features like a purple lights in the planchette but overall they've tried to make the board look

275
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,231
Older than the classic board it's brown and kind of weather and it looks like something you might find on a pirate ship

276
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
He will be gone for

277
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:54,143
The older look just need because people assume these boards have been around for

278
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
Thousands of years which

279
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
I know isn't true

280
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
But

281
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
Belief is important

282
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
Belief is

283
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,895
Very important to the Ouija board especially subconsciously

284
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
Which brings us finally to

285
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
How these things work

286
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,087
Basically when it comes to the

287
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
Ouija board

288
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
The reason

289
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
That

290
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
It seems to work at

291
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
Feels as if it works

292
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
Is down to something called the ideomotor effect

293
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,863
I'm what that is essentially

294
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
Is non-conscious muscular moving

295
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
That's Professor Chris French

296
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,359
I am head of the anomalistic psychology Research Unit at goldsmiths University of London

297
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
Before you ask psychology

298
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,247
Is the psychology of

299
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
Weird stuff

300
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,951
The term ideomotor effect was first coined by an English physician and researcher named William Benjamin carpet

301
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:56,351
Back in 1852 right when spiritualism was starting to become popular both in Europe and the US

302
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,399
The ideomotor effect

303
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
Applies in the case of WeChat

304
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,847
In that our bodies are making small subconscious movements that are Guided by a suggestion or some subconscious

305
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,175
Knowledge of so particularly once the

306
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:16,575
So is lateral to husband has been made apparent and you kind of

307
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
Is going to come next so if it was

308
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
Spelling out a name

309
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,767
And it spells out the letter b and then I will be no trouble

310
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,375
And the ideomotor effect becomes magnified as more people play

311
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,447
I want very interesting things that happened

312
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,495
People who have played around with weave

313
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Ouija board

314
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
Level very often

315
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Claim

316
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,871
That they've got answers from the Ouija

317
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
Nobody around

318
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Borat

319
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,247
Chile news out so that proves it was some

320
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,551
What kind of external agency

321
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,855
Professor French says that what's happening

322
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,183
Here is that our subconscious mind does actually know the

323
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,767
Answer our conscious mind just can't access the information

324
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,095
Researchers are so convinced of this

325
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
They've even used Ouija boards

326
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
To study

327
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Subconscious

328
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
Super example in one of these studies

329
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,055
Participants were asked simple fact based questions like

330
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,407
Is Buenos Aires the capital of Brazil

331
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Percent of the time

332
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,271
But when they used a Ouija board to help them answer the same

333
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,831
Ohio schools then

334
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,623
I got the answers right about

335
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
55%

336
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:28,511
I'm so in other words I didn't know them so you can if they couldn't come to the access it

337
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
There's been all kinds of studies

338
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
Hainan paranormal

339
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
Experiences

340
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:37,215
And Professor friend says they never reveal an external or spiritual Force

341
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
At work they always reveal an internal

342
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Horse at work

343
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
Even if

344
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Subconscious

345
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
I don't have any doubts in my mind.

346
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,711
We can explain the vast majority

347
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Call

348
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,087
Ostensibly paranormal experience by

349
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
Into psychology

350
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,463
Whether or not we can explain every single one

351
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
Is the

352
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
64000 dollar question

353
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Was there an R

354
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
When we played weijia at my house

355
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,335
The planchette seemed less to be governed by the ideomotor effect

356
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
And more by the law of

357
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
Inertia

358
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,503
What's going on

359
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,367
Another experience wasn't terribly strange or creepy

360
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
It was mostly just

361
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Slow

362
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,559
But merch has played enough times to

363
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,351
Just had some weird experiences

364
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Xiaomi

365
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
I think are just

366
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,447
The person pushing and they don't know it

367
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,751
It's clearly ideomotor response

368
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:48,127
Other times it's answered things that just seems so bizarre that I wouldn't know

369
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
You know if you can talk

370
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,759
To the spirit world why wouldn't the Ouija board work

371
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
The real question is

00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Shunyi

Spirit world

375
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,255
And that's a question that has been tugging Humanity since the beginning of time

376
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,327
The first time someone realized when they died

377
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Don't come back

378
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,287
After everyone left my house that night I was sitting on my couch by myself

379
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
It was really quiet

00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:30,367
One of my spring loaded blinds slammed up and scared the s*** out of me

384
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
And I have to admit

385
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,695
I looked at the Ouija board

386
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
I wondered

387
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
