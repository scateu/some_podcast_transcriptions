00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,576
I'm Roman Mars

27
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,672
I am walking down hundreds

28
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,976
Towards Manhattan Avenue

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
I can see the building and

30
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
That's producer Jessica Miller

31
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,680
Wandering around her old neighborhood

32
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
Oh yeah

33
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,800
So you can see on the back of the tower there's like a smokestack

34
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,616
Or at least the remnant of the smokestack

35
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:57,760
Just used to live near Central Park and she's been walking by this building and wondering about it for a long time

36
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:04,416
So she met up with Jim ratzenberger who's done some writing about the building for the New York Times

37
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,280
The address of the building is 455 Central Park West

38
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
And it looks like

39
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,328
The castle

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,656
Huge it takes up the whole East End of the block

41
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,448
It's made up of red brick

42
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
What does intricate Stone trim and it's got

43
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,544
Five or so large cylindrical

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
Cool turrets

45
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
Silver cones on

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
Gigantic gigantic

47
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,688
I was going to say ginormous

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,040
Building looks like something out of a fairy tale

49
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:37,440
Until like Rapunzel could let down her hair through one of the windows for some knight in shining armor

50
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,744
Bro just wandered over from Central Park

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,120
What I found out is that this building's past is not very fairytale like

52
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
At all

53
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,728
You want to let just take a walk around the building and see what we see

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,080
I saw it coming up around the side there are these things that look like

55
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
Smokestack

56
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,688
Kind of off of this Factor

57
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,760
Maine Smoke Stack has been torn down

58
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
And it was

59
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,624
Part of the crematorium where they used to burn bodies

60
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
Well that took a dark turn

61
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
So the building has been renovated but when it was built in 1887 it was the country's first hospital

62
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Devoted solely to the

63
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
The treatment of cancer

64
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,216
And they weren't very good at treating cancer yet

65
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
So

66
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
The crematorium Smoke Stack

67
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
It was smoking pretty often

68
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
The old castle-like building

69
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
At 4:55 Central

70
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,248
Carquest can actually tell us a lot about

71
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
The history of cancer and the

72
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
History of Hospital

73
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
WhatsApp Casino

74
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
It's the late 1800s and people seem to know that cancer starts as a tumor and that sometimes the tumor

75
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,376
Mercante be removed

76
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,472
A lot of hospitals in the US don't even want to treat cancer patients

77
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,544
Some people fear the disease they thought it was contagious

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,336
Some doctors thought it was contagious

79
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
And also

80
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,152
There's a lot of stigma by having the

81
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
That's william shatner

82
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,552
She's a clinical associate professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College

83
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
And she's writing a book about cancer awareness

84
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:16,256
On top of misconceptions about cancer being contagious there was another reason that hospitals might have hesitated

85
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
Today cancer patients

86
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
At the time

87
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,863
They had to publish their death rates

88
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,191
So they turn away patients who are likely to skew the numbers

89
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,591
This is why you had tuberculosis hospitals and other specialty hospitals for diseases that were particularly deadly

90
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,919
In the late 1800s Europe was a bit ahead of the US

91
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
In terms of cancer

92
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,247
During and after the Civil War

93
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,599
Patients in the United States who had money or could afford to go to Europe

94
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
What do so for care

95
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
And

96
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
Doctors from the United

97
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,791
States who then in it for the most part had minimal education would go to Europe

98
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,607
Study science and pathology and surgery

99
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,447
One such man was J Marion Sims

100
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,543
Sims went to Europe and learned a few surgical techniques for removing cancer

101
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,639
He wanted to bring this knowledge back to the US where he had worked previously

102
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
New York Women's Hospital

103
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,015
And then in 1874 the hospital decided

104
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
They wouldn't let women with

105
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
For all the reasons we

106
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
You just talked about

107
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,439
It was two deadly they thought it might be

108
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
Contagious

109
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,255
So in 1884

110
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,143
Simple interest including Elizabeth Cullum who lost her son to cancer and later died from the disease or so

111
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
Broke ground on what would become

112
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,519
The first hospital exclusively devoted to Cancer Care

113
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,383
It opened in 1887 and was designed by architect of Charles hate

114
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,967
Earlier I talked about the hospital looking like a castle

115
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
From a fairytale

116
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
And it turns out that was a

117
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
Pretty common style for hospitals

118
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,695
They look like like castles they look like aristocratic mansions

119
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
And we see in the architecture that they

120
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
They have

121
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:58,911
Deck the walls they have gate houses they have elaborate entry sometimes

122
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Tourette's

123
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
They have

124
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
All the trappings

125
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,335
A very very wealthy neighborhood they're very domestic

126
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
In their

127
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
That's Anne-Marie Adam

128
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,223
I'm sorry I'm Ann-Marie Adams

129
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,295
I'm director of the School of Architecture at McGill University

130
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:22,207
She's also written about hospitals from the time. And she says that in the late 1800s hospitals were chair

131
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,767
Charitable institutions run by wealthy philanthropist

132
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
Where poor people went for care

133
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,399
Rich people still mostly receive Care at home

134
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
But Hospital administrators wanted to change that

135
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
Architecture

136
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
The tool of persuasion

137
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
Convince wealthier

138
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
People

139
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
To come to the hospital

140
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:47,295
1887 the first cancer hospital opened its doors to both paying and non-paying patients with can

141
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,391
And it tried hard to be an inviting place for paying customers

142
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Even the food was good

143
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,207
So they had great chefs

144
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Part of being

145
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Competitive

146
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
Really good food

147
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
People went

148
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
The hospital dining

149
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
To celebrate

150
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Special occasion

151
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,447
Like we might today

152
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
Go to a hotel.

153
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Even out for

154
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
I saw that

155
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
Changed a lot

156
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,247
The cancer hospital for palliative care

157
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,831
In other words just making people comfortable in relieving pain

158
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
So

159
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
They had champagne parties

160
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,207
They took people on carriage rides in

161
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,511
Park again that's Jim rosson

162
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Play met up with at the beginning

163
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,887
Was a beautiful building and meant to be beautiful

164
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
So the people didn't feel like they were going off

165
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
2

166
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,543
A terrible place to die but rather going off to the French Countryside

167
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,943
And the big round turrets with lots of Windows that make the building look like a castle were actually wards

168
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
That has page

169
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,039
But the patients were in beds around

170
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
The perimeter

171
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
And there would be

172
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
10 or 11.

173
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,951
And so the doctor would come in and make his rounds from bed to bed to bed

174
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:03,327
Just make sure you can really picture this the rooms were perfectly circular in about 40 feet in diameter

175
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,215
And an aerial view of the rooms looked a bit like the face of a clock with beds around the perimeter

176
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
But the roundworms weren't just about Aesthetics

177
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
By having these rounded rooms

178
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
Fewer corners

179
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
I was thought that you could

180
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
Keep the hospital cleaner

181
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,527
You know dirt accumulates and Corners so

182
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
Just get rid of the corners

183
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Kind of brilliant

184
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
Another distinguishing

185
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,463
Feature of this hospital and of others at the time

186
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Tons of

187
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,327
Any idea was it the open window

188
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
What allow

189
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Fresh air

190
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
How to flush the

191
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
The space between

192
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
Patience

193
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
And this

194
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,287
Of course played into the idea that

195
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
It's sicknesses traveled in

196
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Bad air

197
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:53,247
This idea that sickness was spread by polluted smelly are was called the Mae eisma Theory

198
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
But the weird thing is

199
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,575
By the time the cancer hospital

200
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,159
Was built the miasma Theory had been debunked by The Germ Theory

201
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
Which rightly held that.

202
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
Diseases spread through germs or micro

203
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
The architecture just

204
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
Haven't caught up yet

205
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,631
The architectural design of a hospital does

206
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
Doesn't always correspond

207
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Exactly

208
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
To the medical

209
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
All theories of that

210
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
I'm almost like

211
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
Society is

212
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
Hesitating

213
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
To fully endorse

214
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,759
Light Airy room champagne parties

215
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Carriage rides

216
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Do the park

217
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
It all sounds

218
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
Kind of charming

219
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,975
Until we get to the part about how nobody had any idea what they were doing medically speaking

220
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
Beyond palliative care the main treatment for cancer at the

221
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
The time with surgery

222
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,167
But surgery for cancer was still incredibly

223
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,775
Massive cutting of people with tumors

224
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,175
With the idea of removing every lymph node in their body and as much as possible it could be done won't keeping them alive

225
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
Surgery was also hugely risky

226
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:01,343
This was before the type of antibiotic soap a lot of people die from infections after surgery

227
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
But desperate patients

228
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
Play Desperate Measures

229
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:08,255
You know what the doctor said I can take this out of you and it's causing pain

230
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,303
Bleeding you know

231
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
People would often agree

232
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:18,495
The surgery is at the Cancer Hospital in New York as in other hospitals at that time were happening in an Amphitheater so that

233
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
That students could watch and learn

234
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,687
There's a show on Cinemax I watch called the Nick but graphically dramatizes he's Amphitheater surgery

235
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
Come around that same time.

236
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:34,111
I want the students to take know the doctor Christensen is answering on the medial line just above the pubis

237
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,975
As you can see there is significant blood in the cavity vacuum

238
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:48,447
Surgeon from this time we're doing pioneering work and patients were pioneering guinea pigs

239
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
We had to start somewhere

240
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,591
But that show makes me so so happy that I live in 21st century

241
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
Agreed things were bad

242
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,455
And they stayed bad for cancer patients for

243
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
Quite a while

244
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
As late as 1920

245
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
Only

246
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
15% or so of patience

247
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Survived

248
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Cancer diagnosis

249
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
For more than two years

250
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,535
Almost everyone died so the numbers were bleak

251
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
And

252
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,375
In 1900 the numbers were even worse

253
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,447
Which must be why they felt they needed a crematorium

254
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
Decide if you were there and you can look out your window

255
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:30,175
And see the smokestack imagine looking up there and seeing smoke come out of that Smoke Stack

256
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
I would have been pretty awful

257
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,575
Under that billowing smoke the New York cancer hospital soon earned a nickname

258
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
The Bastille

259
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,951
It was trying to look like a French Chateau but

260
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
It ended up feeling like a French prison

261
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,839
Which is why despite a huge demand for cancer treatment

262
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
The hospital couldn't get people in the door

263
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,471
That is the very few people wanted to go to the New York answer

264
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
Hospital and what's amazing is that

265
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Good place

266
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
Struggled financially Cancer Care

267
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,455
Before 1904 a long time after was not lucrative

268
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
The hospital also tried to attract

269
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Send funds by

270
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
Procuring a controversial new form of

271
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
Radium

272
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,999
For awhile around 1920 the New York cancer hospital boasted the

273
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
Country single largest repository of radium

274
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,799
Lori in 1921 in therapy

275
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Understood

276
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:34,175
It was administered by people who didn't know how to administer it be

277
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
Didn't really understand it

278
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,063
A lot of the radiation workers doctors in nursing

279
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
Themself develop cancer

280
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,511
It wasn't until the 1930s or so that things started to improve surgery became better the radiation

281
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
Woodworking

282
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,631
I think of the 1960s and 1970s then you have

283
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
Chemotherapy and

284
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,751
Much more how much more organized approach to cancer

285
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,567
Care and one that ultimately became very lucrative

286
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,639
In 1939 the cancer hospital left Forks

287
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
$0.55

288
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Carquest for the operator

289
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Decide

290
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
Where became Memorial Sloan-Kettering

291
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
Which is now known as one of the best hospitals

292
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
For cancer treatment in the US

293
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,927
And of course

294
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
Hospitals don't look like castles anymore

295
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
After World War 1

296
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,047
Hospital start to look like

297
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
Small Civic and

298
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
Institutions more like City Halls or

299
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
Or schools

300
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
They're very square that is called

301
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
The block plan

302
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
We also see the end of big open Words

303
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
With lots of bed

304
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
Paying patients could expect

305
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Single room

306
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
Or

307
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
Typical page

308
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
Could being a double room or a room

309
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
And we said goodbye

310
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
The good food Champaign

311
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
And carriage ride

312
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,207
The money was channeled in things like surgical Suite

313
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
And in mechanical equipment

314
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
And rather than

315
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Decoration

316
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,631
And we see like things like wooden beds and dresser

317
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Pierre everything

318
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Is metal

319
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
It has a kind of look at

320
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,823
After World War II the office building / skyscraper

321
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
It all changes again and then I

322
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
1980s

323
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
With the onset of

324
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
What we call Payson

325
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
Tendercare

326
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
For the atrium

327
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,135
These are hospitals that look like shopping malls

328
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Just one or two floors

329
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
Big Open Spaces

330
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
We not to bury

331
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Kind of capsule

332
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,375
We've done away with completely round rooms now

333
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,983
But the general idea of round rooms being easier to keep clean as actually persisted

334
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
So where the wall meets

335
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
The floor

336
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
If you

337
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Visit Hospital

338
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
Today you'll see it probably

339
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
Curved

340
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
So that nothing could get

341
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Stock in

342
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
In the right angle

343
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
In the wall in the floor

344
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,743
As for the castle-like building that housed the first cancer hospital.

345
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,071
In the mid-1950s who becomes Tower nursing home

346
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,631
That becomes one of the most notorious nursing home

347
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
New York

348
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Is this a place

349
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
Terrible things happen

350
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
Roaches crawling around walls

351
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
Patients being abused

352
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,455
The nursing home was shut down in the

353
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,551
And the building sat vacant and in a state of disrepair for along

354
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,879
Jim ratzenberger used to walk by at in the 80s

355
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Thought it was a

356
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Cookie place

357
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
But it was even better than that

358
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
The castle

359
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
It just seemed to be

360
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
Inevitable fall

361
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
It was really

362
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
Didn't seem to be any escape from that

363
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,055
Because it has gotten so bad

364
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Try to make some

365
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Building

366
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
That was New York in the 1980s

367
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,527
In 21st century Manhattan even haunted castles can return to the Luxury Condominiums

368
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,599
In the year 2000 the building was bought by a developer

369
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
Now it's

370
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,159
