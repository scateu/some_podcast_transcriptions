31
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,696
Five steps to keep in a defecting population

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Step one

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,352
Build a 12ft reinforced concrete wall

34
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,400
Bill the second wall right next to it

35
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,472
Creating a no man's land in between then there was a

36
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:51,616
1020 M wide strip of land which

37
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
Absolutely nothing that's me man's land that was sprayed with chemicals that not even grassquit

38
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,160
And it was rate everyday that you could see the slightest clue that there was a Skype

39
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
Step 3

40
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,024
Build a narrow road for vehicles of the secret police

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
The Stasi

42
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072
Step four

43
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,400
Add electrified barbed wire and also at 5

44
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:21,056
Signal wire signal wires that if you touch it immediately and one of the watchtowers

45
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,128
There was the alarm ringing

46
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,248
At its peak the Berlin wall with a hundred miles long

47
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:34,368
Today only about a mile is left standing compared with other famous walls in history

48
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,512
This wall had a pretty short life span the Great Wall of China has been around for 2500 years

49
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,072
So have the walls of ancient Babylon

50
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
Although it's most famous part

51
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,680
The Ishtar gate is actually in a museum

52
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
In Berlin

53
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,544
This is Daniel gross but even though the wall dividing Berlin into east and west

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
It was only up for 30 years

55
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,896
It had a huge impact on the psyche of the city

56
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
It broke families into

57
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504
Now let's remember how we got here

58
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,344
In 1945 Berlin was the Fallen Nazi capital

59
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
The weary Victor's could agree on two things

60
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
1

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
Hitler was bad

62
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
2

63
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
Germany needed a big change

64
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,840
After that they did not agree on very much

65
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,400
Berlin with carved up into two sectors

66
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,960
With Western countries controlling the west of the city

67
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,008
And the Soviet Union controlling the east

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,360
West Berlin had a booming post-war economy life was tougher

69
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
Annie's Berlin

70
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,992
So in the decade that followed more than two million people fled from east to west

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
East Germany was losing its most skilled workers

72
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
Jobs

73
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
And reunite with their families across the border

74
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
And East Germany with losing face

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,512
Whatever you East Berliner who chose to defect

76
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,072
And that's why in 1961

77
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,400
East Germany close its border to West Berlin

78
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
With a wall

79
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,264
But this isn't a story about the design of the Berlin Wall

80
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,824
This is a story about one design

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
To get through it

82
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Or relay

83
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Underneath

84
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
Rob Thomas

85
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Who's there

86
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,528
The tunnel had a diameter of less than one square me

87
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
We have to

88
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Save

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,160
Space the less we excavate

90
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
You couldn't sense

91
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
You were laying on your back

92
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
Girl

93
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Affronted

94
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,167
Weather feeds we were driving the Spade into the front

95
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,239
You couldn't dig for more than 2 hours

96
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,735
In 1964 Roth West 21

97
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
At the Free University of Berlin

98
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,647
Rapha studying civil engineering at school he made a lot of models and did a lot of math

99
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:50,047
But you haven't really ever built anything and like virtually everyone in West Berlin Roth new and wizard

100
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
Related to people in East Berlin parents brothers sisters cousins classmates

101
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
How could they get to the West

102
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
You couldn't have trouble with a woman

103
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
Couldn't fly over it

104
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
It was the only way

105
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Ticketon

106
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,575
In 1964 westerners could still visit the East if they were in good standing with the East German government

107
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,903
That year Ralph took a trip with his parents and sister

108
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
From the West

109
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
To the east

110
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
To visit extended family

111
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
My cousin

112
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,815
Approach my sister and me and said can you do something

113
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
For me I must get out of here

114
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,287
Rumors have been going around of tunnels popping up beneath the city

115
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
So when I get back to

116
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
Timberland

117
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
I had an idea

118
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
Who was involved here

119
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,063
And I approached him

120
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
People living together in the student Salvatore

121
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,487
I approached him I asked him and

122
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
40 Slater was in the tunnel

123
00:05:54,815 --> 00:06:00,959
Better be clear the kids were tumbling from west to east they were tunneling into communist eastborough

124
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,031
Ralph of defunct Bakery along the border

125
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,615
It it closed because too many of its customers were stuck in the east

126
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,247
Near the baker's entrance you could actually see East German guard towers looming over the wall

127
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,343
And in that Bakery young berliners were tearing into the ground

128
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
Trying to dig a tunnel under the wall

129
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
East Berlin

130
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
We were digging

131
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
Vertically down

132
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
Until we got to the ground with tape

133
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,887
If you don't want your tunnel to flood it stay above the water table

134
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:35,007
And from there we said okay half meter above the ground holder table we dig for it

135
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
Straightforward horizontal

136
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
Very simple

137
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:42,431
Very simple in theory and practice Berlin is a nightmare underneath the surface

138
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
The city is a swamp

139
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,879
The ground is so wet and Sandy that to this day construction workers have to pump water out of Berlin soil

140
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
In order to build new Subway tunnel

141
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,535
They even use mobile Refrigeration units to freeze the ground solid

142
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
In trouble spots

143
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
But the soil over by the bakery

144
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
Happened to be perfect

145
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
For tunneling

146
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
Because he was

147
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,055
BD geologic soil is

148
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,359
Consisting mainly of

149
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Play

150
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
That means if you dig there a hole in it

151
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
It is self-supporting

152
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,527
Rats and collapses

153
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
And this is one of

154
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
Very very few

155
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Areas

156
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
In and around Berlin

157
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:29,791
That you have such as sulfur make that made it for us so

158
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,839
Interesting of course.

159
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:37,215
So from an engineering perspective this Bakery seemed like the perfect place to dig a tunnel

160
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,543
But strategically it seem like a terrible choice

161
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,359
This was the spot where right after the wall was built

162
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,455
Some Germans in the East try to jump out of their apartment windows

163
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
Into the West

164
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,319
Which Middle Eastern government extra careful about security

165
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
During the lifespan of the wall

166
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
5 people died

167
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
On this stretch of border

168
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:03,071
Talking about a bunch of twenty-somethings digging a tunnel the length of 1 1/2 football fields

169
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
With a garden Spade

170
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,935
And a wheelbarrow under one of the most fortified borders on Earth

171
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,007
Ruffles actually joining the second tunnel that this group of Doug

172
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,311
The first tunnel in stretched nearly 500

173
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
Eat a six-month effort

174
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,687
The day they reach the backyard of an apartment building in the east

175
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
It was snowing

176
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,295
Because the air inside the tunnel was warmer than outside

177
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,343
They left a small circle of melted

178
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Snow

179
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,927
Which basically told the Stars ain't you there's a

180
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
Tunnel over here

181
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
Within a few hours the study found out

182
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
Flooded the tunnel with water

183
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,887
But Ralph, says that being 20 years old and free Berlin

184
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
They were all naive enough

185
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
To try again

186
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,775
One of the student leaders Wolfgang Fuchs

187
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
Proposed a bit of reverse psychology

188
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
Wolfgang

189
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,895
Who was really smart guy

190
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Take a note

191
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
The Stasi

192
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Buffoon

193
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:58,879
He would not even dream about that we use the same location

194
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
For another Channel

195
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
So idiotic nobody could be

196
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
I need break

197
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,863
And also tunnel rail started working on in the summer of 1964

198
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,447
The bakery where the tunnel started was in the basement of an apartment building

199
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
For the retirees

200
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,055
A group of 20 or so students going in and out all the time

201
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
Would have been suspicious

202
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
So they had to be stealthy

203
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,175
They can only come in and out every couple weeks

204
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
In other words

205
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:29,087
They had to live there the bakery had become a makeshift home they slept in military cots

206
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,695
And warmed up canned food on a little electric stove that ran on borrowed electricity

207
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,791
Of course we need more power

208
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,351
Then that retired couple

209
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
Is using normally

210
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,215
The most stupid man of power company would say

211
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:50,591
My goodness normally that pay you back I know about $20 a month and now

212
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,895
They consume for 200

213
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
So wonderful

214
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
Our

215
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
Friends managed

216
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,831
To get to the power supply cable

217
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,415
Before it went into the distribution board

218
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:09,279
For the power was metered and registered to the various apart

219
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
The windows were painted white on the inside

220
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
To minimize suspicion

221
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
But maximize lighting

222
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
In the bakery storage room

223
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,983
Flour and salt and sugar

224
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
I've been replaced with heaps and heaps of dirt

225
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
And when they need fresh supplies

226
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,151
Bike tools baked beans

227
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
Spare parts

228
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,711
Soda

229
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
That was where Ralph came in

230
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,575
I had a job as a student on the weekend

231
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
To deliver

232
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Drinks

233
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:42,047
Home service

234
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
Station biggest station wagon

235
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
And that was of course

236
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
Perfect camouflage

237
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
Airport

238
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
Bringing in tools

239
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
Spare parts

240
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,615
Ken's Branch drinks

241
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,687
In these boxes we're normally the bottle spray

242
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
How much

243
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Boiled you think you moved

244
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,159
The shaft going down that had a size of two by two

245
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,743
12 meters that is

246
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
Intuitive

247
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,863
It's already almost 50 cubic meters yeah and then

248
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
20:45

249
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
I never thought about it

250
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,775
Never thought about it could be close to 200 cubic meters

251
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,407
Crossword

252
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,247
An 18-wheeler truck can haul about 50 cubic meters

253
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,807
It's a wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow

254
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,599
Through the summer and into the autumn

255
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,439
Rubbing his friends scraped and carved and heaved enough dirt

256
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,255
I feel for 18 wheeler big rigs

257
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,863
All the while worried the Stasi would spot them coming in and out

258
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
Or detect them with special acoustic sensors

259
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
Fall 1964

260
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
They finally reached they eat

261
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,151
They tamed for a basement just like last time

262
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
But again they miscalculated

263
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,527
The one who was on Judy on the front face of the tunnel

264
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
Quebec

265
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
With a little plant

266
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,879
He's so low

267
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
And that was gross

268
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
They hadn't noticed that the Border Zone slope

269
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Slightly downward

270
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,119
Which is forgivable given the fact that they couldn't properly survey the land but this time they were lucky

271
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
That come up inside an abandoned shed

272
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,983
Soon after the tunnelers left the shed

273
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,847
They sent a crew of Messengers above-ground legally into East Berlin

274
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:36,991
To alert their friends and relatives of the internet escape the message included a time a place

275
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Ana pastor

276
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:42,111
At a time the radios were buzzing with the news at the recent Olympics

277
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,511
Tokyo is dressed in her holiday best for the opening

278
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,047
The 18th modern Olympic

279
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
And so the password

280
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
What's Tokyo

281
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,447
Ralph and his friends took turns standing watch in the east

282
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,519
Holding pistols they hope they wouldn't have to use

283
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
Back in the West

284
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,871
Another students should watch on the roof with a walkie-talkie

285
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
Dentist office on Glenside

286
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,735
Gabriela Cruz a very precise plan

287
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,087
8:20 p.m. there is coming a couple

288
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:17,439
At 8:30 p.m. this coming a small family with one child

289
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
And with the walkie-talkie

290
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,071
Gave us the information oh yeah

291
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,887
Refugee number so-and-so is coming

292
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
We gave the information

293
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
Show the front end of the tunnel in the east

294
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
That our

295
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
People could prepare

296
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
To open the door if the refugee

297
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
Comes knocking at the door

298
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
Anderson Jockey Lot

299
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,063
1byone East Germans entered the shed in the East and came out in the bakery

300
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
In the West

301
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
It was after 10 p.m.

302
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
Ralph is now on duty in the last

303
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,231
She parked his VW bus around the corner

304
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,815
I'm going to drive the escapees to their first night of freedom

305
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,399
In this pass it was so silent

306
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
Nobody talk to me

307
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
Just sitting there like

308
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,775
Like an iceberg

309
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
And then

310
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
I heard

311
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,407
1 whispering to his neighbor

312
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
Who knows whether we are really in the best

313
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
Part is it flooded

314
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
Another trap

315
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
I never heard that that that

316
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
Was like an electric shock

317
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
These are East Germans who have disc

318
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,535
Crawled to Freedom through 500 ft

319
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Of mud

320
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,631
The freedom have been Out Of Reach for so long

321
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
That they didn't believe it when they saw it

322
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,751
The Ralph decided to take a quick detour

323
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
He thought to himself

324
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
You go with them not the

325
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
You go through cool.

326
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479
That they see it with their own eyes

327
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,575
Christendom was the center of West Berlin

328
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
Site of the second largest department store in Europe

329
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,023
Is covered with neon lights and advertisements for Coca Cola and Marlboro

330
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
What you'd never see in the east

331
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
Out of a sudden

332
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,423
Tripping the rift joking

333
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Laughing

334
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
We made it

335
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,543
As if it had been yesterday

336
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,823
Still in my head

337
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
The tunnel operated for two nights

338
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,479
But among the students was at least one spy

339
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:22,367
At the end of the second night two plain-clothes policemen knocked in the apartment door in the east

340
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,927
Tipped off by one of the spine students

341
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,743
They did not know the password Tokyo

342
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,583
One of the students standing watch open the door

343
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,167
A moment later and East German Soldier appeared

344
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,215
Pushed his way into the building

345
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,543
And cornered the student at the door with a Kalashnikov

346
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
Ben another student

347
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Fired a shot

348
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,223
All of them sprinted to the backyard and into the shed

349
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,295
Well the East German police fired shots after them

350
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,183
By the end of the night one East German Soldier was dead

351
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
The tunnel have been destroyed With Grenades

352
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,815
And 57 people had escaped

353
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,143
Into the tunnel became known as tunnel 57

354
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
But the one person Ralph was trying to get out

355
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
His cousin

356
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
Was not among them

357
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
After the tunnel was destroyed

358
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,687
East German newspapers wrote about Western gangsters

359
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
To Eternal denim killed one of their soldiers

360
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,343
The East German government install the plaque where the Escape had occurred

361
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,903
Condemning this violent assassination

362
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,231
The Western student sent a letter over the wall

363
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
Using balloons

364
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,887
It read we speak on behalf of our group which over the last half-year

365
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,471
Built a tunnel through which 57 fugitive splat

366
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
And the entrance to which your son was shot

367
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,615
First we would like to express our sincerest sympathies

368
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
Verso heavy Outlaws

369
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,735
They were taking responsibility for the death of this Eastern Soldier

370
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
The letter went on

371
00:16:54,271 --> 00:17:00,415
But the real murderer is the system that addressed the massive flood of its citizens not by removing the car

372
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
Cause of the problem

373
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,487
But by building a wall

374
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
And giving the order for Germans

375
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
Deschutes German

376
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,631
Mystery persisted for exactly 30 years

377
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
Longer than the wall even existed

378
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,263
The story that in helping 57 people escape

379
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,335
Western tunnelers killed in eastern Soldier

380
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,151
Use of the Wall came down in 1989

381
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,759
Josey records revealed that the Eastern Soldier was actually killed by Friendly Fire

382
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,783
In all the confusion

383
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,855
The six steps to controlling it affecting population

384
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
Build a wall around information

385
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
And preserve the regimes reputation

386
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
We destroyed the world

387
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
Down to its roots

388
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
And only a year later

389
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,679
Head over to McAfee done with with our own answer

390
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
No clue only

391
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Here

392
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:50,335
Hundred and there's a little bit left and that was entry Reserve

393
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,383
You must understand that from situation

394
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,991
The best Bolognese never let me say they were fenced in

395
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
Living like prisoners in

396
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
Infragard

397
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
There was such hate

398
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Emotion

399
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
Yeah

400
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
Turn it down Destroyer

401
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,679
Never never never ever again

402
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,239
This is kind of a paradox of the past

403
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
In Berlin

404
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
Destroy it

405
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
But never forget

406
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,151
This is a city with layers and layers of History

407
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
I get much of it is gone

408
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
The bunker where Hitler died for instance

409
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
With mostly demolished

410
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
Predicting it was totally unmarked

411
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,671
To prevent it from becoming a symbolic site for neo-nazis

412
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,511
The government finally installed the plaque in 2006

413
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,839
Even the largest remnant of the wall

414
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
The East Side gallery

415
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,679
Which is covered with paintings from International artists

416
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,239
It's slated for partial demolition

417
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,287
To make room for luxury apartments

418
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,431
Milkovich became a transportation engineer

419
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
He digs tunnels for a living

420
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,039
How many tunnels have you helped build

421
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,671
Subway tunnels

422

What else

433
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,087
These tunnels were way way bigger

434
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,415
And it's crappy tunnel he dug with friends under the wall

435
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,999
Pepper off all those tunnels lead back at least in his mom
