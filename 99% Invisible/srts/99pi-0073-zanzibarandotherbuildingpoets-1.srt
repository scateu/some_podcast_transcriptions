00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
Actor something like that

44
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
But he isn't

Changing Skyline

57
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
This is how it work

58
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
A developer bought an old house

59
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:54,336
Had an architect plans for high-rise and then stepped in

60
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,688
And my job consisted on very simple thing

61
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
Had to give a name

62
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,832
He worked early in the mornings and

63
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
How to get into people's heads

64
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,904
I have to

65
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
Walk around a lot

66
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
Know the different neighborhoods

67
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
And see what color

68
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
Patristics

69
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
That neighborhood had

70
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
And what characteristics

71
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
It would

72
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
People who

73
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Vine

74
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
You looking for

75
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
So

76
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
People aspired

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
To be something else

78
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
They wanted

79
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
So they had a dream

80
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,296
And I had to walk around the neighborhood

81
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Thinking

82
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
Kind of dream

83
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
That person was

84
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
Looking for and a happy device

85
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
A name

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Phylactery

87
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,632
Rodrigo works for a public relations firm it's one of 10 or so in Santiago that we're doing this kind of thing

88
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,960
As far as I know no other firm had a poet on staff

89
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,824
Little was in school at the time working three jobs to support himself and his family

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,688
In the course of a little over a year he named more than 40 buildings all over the capitol

91
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:07,296
Basically doesn't the little poems he wrote are now embedded into the design of his City

92
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
Well to be honest that

93
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
I wouldn't confess this in Spanish

94
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
ECI

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,559
I don't feel quite proud although you might consider as you suggest

96
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
My first publication

97
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,447
Baby short poems

98
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,031
But I think it mount

99
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
I'm listening to myself as I speak

100
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,175
I think it is it is a story that should be told

101
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
Because it's a story of a

102
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Dreams of people

103
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,367
Proud or not he wrote hundreds of building name poems

104
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,695
He conjured the names from myths from history from literature

105
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
And even did some field research

106
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,071
What time he had the name a few buildings going up near Santiago's Polo Club

107
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
But there was a catch

108
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
He couldn't use the words

109
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
Polo or Club

110
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
So it's not going to a party there to look

111
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
Looking for just the right name

112
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,775
The first thing that I learned is that you don't dress

113
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,335
Because he be dressed happier

114
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
You just trying too hard

115
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,943
Turquoise coming up with names was just half the job

116
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,991
The other half was negotiating with developer

117
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,551
Yeah I would choose the best 10

118
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
Given

119
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
A speech

120
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
What characteristic

121
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
What kind of dreams were behind each of these

122
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
10 Main

123
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
And they were

124
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,351
I know that what you own until he said their own name

125
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,655
Well and it can also be called

126
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
Don Jorge

127
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,055
So yeah not poetry to win Awards necessarily

128
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,127
But like all good poetry some of his work to be transformative

129
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,967
There's just one neighborhood tell yeah I know that's particularly cold and humid

130
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,551
Thanks Rodrigo at now has buildings that make it seem almost trapped

131
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
Imagine that to forget the weather

132
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
Residents might sit on their balconies

133
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
Staring at the slate gray sky

134
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
And dream beaches

135
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
Surfer names

136
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
Cancun

137
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,327
Cancun.

138
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:00,703
Cancun weather

139
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,823
And the developers was so excited about they said they they bought palm trees

140
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
And planted them in front of the

141
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:13,247
I take it there aren't huge Groves of palm trees and Santiago know there are not

142
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:18,111
It's not a natural thing to have palm trees in Santiago way have a Mediterranean climate

143
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
Granada Caribe

144
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,999
Cancun's were some of the first buildings in the area and they sold really well

145
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:29,631
So the other developers followed suit so there's a whole neighborhood with names of islands in

146
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,911
And beaches

147
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
It looks like

148
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Hawaii

149
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
He learned to read the taste of his clients

150
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
The meeting

151
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
We're usually in the office

152
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,199
Of that development which gave me a lot of

153
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
What

154
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
What he wanted to be seen

155
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
Nssi

156
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,647
One time he went to a developer's office that was just a lousy

157
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Weekly column

158
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
Lots of imitation of marble

159
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
And everything

160
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Colin even like

161
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,887
Greek columns in order to get to the bathroom and

162
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:07,007
When they sat down to talk names relieved abandoned all the research it done going in

163
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
And he said

164
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
How would you like to

165
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
That the building gold

166
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
Dennis Bethenny

167
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Oh yes

168
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Sparta

169
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
Oh yes

170
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
Even there's a building called

171
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,319
Olympia Alice

172
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:28,767
How do you come up with you

173
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
I've been working on this fabricated whole story

174
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
Services building an identity

175
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,543
Scaffold one story about a ship called the son seba Zanzibar

176
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
See you at was a s*** build

177
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Longwood

178
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
Most likely small

179
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
But the Scentsy bar never sank

180
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
Never had it

181
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,527
Survive 2

182
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
And it was always known as a

183
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Discrete

184
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
And they really like

185
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
Sounds

186
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
So

187
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,911
It works so well he used it again and again and again

188
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,239
He actually can't even remember how many times you use the same trick

189
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,591
Yeah I can't remember at this time I think I am made up

190
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,663
To see what I made up Normandy

191
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
French name

192
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Well this was

193
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
What's the competition

194
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
It's always the same story

195
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
It's a shame

196
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,647
Build to survive

197
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
And

198
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,255
When you mix a lottery with

199
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Survival of

200
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,839
Tragedies that's very important for chili

201
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,167
Cuz that's a search of status and the survival of

202
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Earthquake

203
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,007
Edible developer rubbed him the wrong way he's sneaking a joke

204
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:47,615
There's a building in Santiago name in fantastic Ariane which sounds nice even Noble

205
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
Investment children of Kings in Spanish

206
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
And Korean

207
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,735
I said oo

208
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Gibson

209
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,343
Prestige sure does

210
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:01,439
And let you know that the infant has a carry on

211
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,279
One of the most famous epic poems in the Spanish language

212
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
And you're not just any villains

213
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
There was a real bastard

214
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
They raped

215
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
A girl in the books

216
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:18,335
It does is not really something that you would be proud up at the developer he really liked it and and

217
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
He wasn't accepting any

218
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Single name

219
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,015
And I was angry and I said okay you might as well call it looking fantastic.

220
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Yes

221
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
So there is a building

222
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,623
A name dr. Aziz

223
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
Literary rape

224
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
But when he wasn't tricking his client

225
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
Rodrigo was

226
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
Interpreting dreams

227
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,983
That's important because he was naming buildings that hadn't been built yet

228
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
Do nothing but drawings on a piece of paper

229
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
The name of the last step

230
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,615
Before the brochures to be printed up

231
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,175
And those brochures wear with the buyers took the bank

232
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
When they ask for a loan

233
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
Open up Apartments were sold the building went up

234
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
If not

235
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Project was abandoned

236
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:06,207
And the entire city was remade this way families taking a chance on imaginary buildings with made-up names

237
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,047
The same process repeated thousands of times in hundreds of neighborhoods

238
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
Husbands and wives

239
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
Looking at a picture

240
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
Reading a poem

241
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
I'm taking a chance

242
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,959
And Rodrigo did the same thing

243
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
He lives in one of these buildings now

244
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
Unfortunately

245
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,871
The name of his building was a decidedly lacking

246
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
An imagination

247
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,991

250
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,903
Redundant building

251
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
So what if it's redundant

252
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,303

We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

271
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
