00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:44,448
He was 33 years old and he was working as an assistant to another psychiatrist

33
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,520
He hadn't had any of his big Ideas yet

34
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
But he was about

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,152
That's producer and hepperman Freud was mostly practicing hypnosis at the time

36
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,480
Still kind of a controversial treatment

President of Wesleyan University historian

39
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,536
Fred's new patient was struggling from all kinds of ailments

40
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
Asteria sleeplessness

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
Pain and odd text

42
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,912
Fannie Moser has lots of doctors

43
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,592
Tiffany Moser would come in and Freud would have her lay down on the couch just like he did with his other patients

44
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
Eyelids getting heavy

45
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,712
Fred wasn't the only person using a couch during hypnosis but

46
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,552
He particularly needed it to get people into a more relaxed

47
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,600
8 heavier and heavier

48
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,904
You're breathing deeper and deeper

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
But he wasn't very good hypnotist

50
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
She was kind of a clumsy hypnotize

51
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:46,656
Moser was on the couch. You're getting sleepy you're getting sleepy

52
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
No I'm not

53
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
She talk

54
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:57,664
Interrupt her with his theories but Fanny just wasn't having it

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
She wanted to talk

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,736
First let me tell you my stories

57
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,552
And then the light goes on

Revelation

59
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,184
If you just let patients talk and don't say anything

60
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
They will let down their defences

61
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
And the unconscious

62
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:19,168
Will be revealed this is the moment when the pre Freudian Freud becomes a free ride

63
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,496
Freudian Freud's new techniques and theories for therapy

64
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Would come to be called

65
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
Psychonaut

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,688
Most new theories in the world to not get assigned their own piece of furniture

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
But

68
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,016
This one ultimately inexorably dead

69
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,296
The couch

70
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,112
If psychoanalysis had a flag

71
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
Oh you know

72
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
It would have a picture

73
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
Macau China

74
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,280
You can actually go visit price couch

75
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
It's in his last home in London

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,632
Freud had the couch ship from Vienna after

77
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
Fleeing the Nazis in 1938

78
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,960
Good call Sigmund

79
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,800
It's all patients on his couch right up to his death a year later

80
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,896
We sent our de facto London correspondent the allusionist Helen zaltzman

81
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
To check it out

82
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:07,808
This is Helen zaltzman reporting count signed from Freud's old study

83
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,392
But the one we now associate with him with a gift from a page

84
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
I'm a dime

85
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,256
She told Freud that if she was going to have her head examined

86
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
She might as well be comfortable

87
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,887
Apparently she found the couch Freud had at the time sorely lacking

88
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
So she got him a Cozier one

89
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:29,055
It's really a very cozy looking couches mechanical looking into it it looks like a great place to take a nap

90
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,639
Print studies full of rugs and books and artifacts from other culture

91
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,223
It has sort of an Indiana Jones vibe to it

92
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
This couch is in keeping with that

93
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
It's a Devon style so

94
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,343
Some people might call it a swimming cap

95
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,439
It's covered in exotic red Persian carpets and piled

96
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
Velvet pillows

97
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,327
So you can actually tell what the couch beneath it is ready like whether it's

98
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,119
Stain remover

99
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,143
Human Experience

100
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,263
What's underneath is a surprisingly Plain Jane beige sofa

101
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
All clean lines in rectangular form

102
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
It's almost boring

103
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,503
A very popular style back when Fred got it in 1891

104
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Domestic

105
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,415
Piece of furniture designed for relaxing and dream

106
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:21,535
But the more patients Freud saw on the couch

107
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,351
Couch became thought of as an essential instrument

108
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
In Freudian psychoanalysis

109
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:31,007
Look at that the couch was Central to the idea of getting to the unconscious

110
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
That's Dr Arnold rich

111
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
A psychoanalyst

112
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,639
Two practices on New York's Upper East Side

113
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:42,783
In traditional analysis Richard says the couch is a tool a patient lies down on his or her back

114
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
Looking up at the ceiling

115
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,879
To staring up your steering

116
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
Into yourself

117
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
You looking inside

118
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
Rabbit outside

119
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,071
Traditional psychoanalysts believe the

120
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Couch

121
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,143
House of patient relax and open up

122
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,543
And understand their unconscious conflicts and inhibitions like why you can't do no finish your paper while

123
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Why you can't work

124
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,663
What are your symptoms and what are your inhibitions and you want to understand

125
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
And that's what cycle analysis of cycling

126
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
Therapy is a

127
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,087
And some of these therapist believe that even the placement of the couch

128
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
Like where it is in a room

129
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Makes a

130
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
I know there was one analyst

131
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,511
Who would put the couch in the middle of the room

132
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
Because he felt it

133
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,119
The patient shouldn't be close to a wall

134
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,679
That the war would make them secure

135
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,263
And he wanted the patient to be insecure

136
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,079
He wanted to promote the regression

137
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:43,455
The endless typically sits in a chair out of sight from the patient on the couch

138
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,855
I know some analysts believe this positioning helps the patient feel Freer to open up Droid may have had more selfie

139
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:56,255
Which reasons he wants were marked I cannot put up with being stared at by other people for 8 hours a day

140
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
In any case

141
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
When an object play such a

142
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
Central role to the work that you do

143
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
Choosing the right one becomes a big deal

144
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
It's like a Rite of Passage

145
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
Just like you made it

146
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,823
Which means good business for the guys making those couches

147
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,383
We had to have a separate

148
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:18,271
Factory just to make the couches cuz we also made sofas and club chairs

149
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,623
Fred branfman used to run Imperial leather furniture company in Queens New York

150
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,231
And selling psychoanalytic couches since the 1940s

151
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,887
Actually patented a version of a psychoanalytic couch he designed with his bed

152
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
Business partner

153
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,959
Alicia brafman says her father was it

154
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,239
Extremely proud of it

155
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,799
Every time anybody walked into the store

156
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,871
Kids saucer up to them and say you know he would say

157
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
We make Freud's couches

158
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
Which of course they didn't

159
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,063
The couch say sold wasn't exotic

160
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
Cozy pile of cushions

161
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,903
Their psychoanalytic couches work

162
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
Like the one you're probably thinking of

163
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Low to the ground

164
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:04,095
Sleek Rahman soldi psychoanalytic couches all over the country and around the world

165
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
For decades

166
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
And the psychoanalyst

167
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Finance

168
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
Add some particular aesthetic

169
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
Most of them were being made in leather

170
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Patience

171
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,687
They would pick at it because they were edgy nervous and

172
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,271
It would present the maintenance problem basically

173
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
Constructing the perfect

174
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
Psychoanalytic couch

175
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
Is like building a sofa

176
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
For Goldilocks

177
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
It can't be too sore

178
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,231
And it can't be too hard

179
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
So will you

180
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
Special spring and special

181
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,399
Cotton and Hozier Hagia combination

182
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,471
To make it as they said just right

183
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,871
Fred's business boomed in the 40s 50s and early 60s what some have called the Golden Age of psycho

184
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,943
Who is very good very good business

185
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
But then in the late 60s

186
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
Things changed

187
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,599
People started to experiment with alternative Therapies

188
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,439
And the first generation of antidepressants offered faster relief

189
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
Traditional psychoanalysis

190
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
Fell out of favor

191
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,119
And you might be able to guess what happened to analytic couch sale

192
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,935
Now couches aren't being used all that much

193
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Please

194
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
Play sit up in

195
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
Club chairs with lounge chairs and

196
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
They took the league

197
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Psychoanalyze

198
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,711
Even within psychoanalytic circles

199
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,759
People became less certain that the

200
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
Couch was a good tool

201
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,599
Different schools of thought started cropping up

202
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
Whether or not you use the

203
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
The couch

204
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
You know

205
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:38,047
Can determine you know what you're doing and why you're doing it while you theory is

206
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,119
You can say that two camps formed in psychoanalysis

207
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Team couch

208
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
Antino couch

209
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,775
Some would say it's easier to have a conversation you know sitting face-to-face

210
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,823
And some people some analysts

211
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,383
Psychobabble insist on not using the couch

212
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
They said they preferred sitting up

213
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
Richard's hasn't really chosen it

214
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
In his office there is a couch and a chair

215
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
I do whatever seems to

216
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
What works

217
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
Best for the patient

218
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,999
There may be a team couch in the team no couch but even Floyd wasn't that dogmatic about it

219
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:13,375
Patience heat-treated on the couch and Sami didn't like the famous composer Gustav Mahler

220
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,191
Employee treated while strolling around the park

221
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
But here's the thing

222
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
Well Freud wasn't dogmatic about using the cow

223
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359
And while use of the psychoanalytic couches

224
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Does declined

225
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
You wouldn't know it from popular culture

226
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,759
The analytic couch has become shorthand for therapy

227
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
Particularly in one place

228
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,111
Hi I'm Batman car from cartoon editor

229
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,463
Bob mankoff is surprisingly qualified to

230
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
To talk about this

231
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,839
Well I have a background in experimental psychology he wasn't a psychoanalyst exactly

232
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,679
I was an animal behaviorist so to put the little rats and pigeons on couches

233
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
Extraordinary

234
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
Manta says the couch is Fanta

235
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Thick as a symbol

236
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
It is just what a joke needs

237
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,895
I think the couch immediately established

238
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Power relations

239
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
The psychiatrist is in control

240
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
You are so helpful

241
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
Childlike

242
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
Lying on the couch

243
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,951
Even though real therapist aren't using the couch all that much

244
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Cartoonists

245
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
Still need it when we look at

246
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
The cartoons now

247
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,119
We do see that they're all on the couch

248
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
Of course it's not just the New Yorker we've seen the couch all over popular culture like it's hard to imagine Woody Allen

249
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Without the couch

250
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,359
You've been seeing a psychiatrist for 15 years

251
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,431
You should smoke some of this uke off the captain no time

252
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
And then there's The Sopranos

253
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,039
Tony Soprano spends a lot of time with her

254
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,623
Even though he's always sitting in a chair

255
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,999
When the camera pans out there is a very typical Brown analytic couch in the back

256
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
As if the set designer wanted to reassure our subconscious about what he was doing there

257
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
Not imagine

258
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
Having to make New Yorker therapy jokes

259
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
Altec how does a device

260
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
How don't make me cry

261
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,199
I've made by mangkok Rio just like to win

262
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
The couch

263
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
Back there I mean

264
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,415
Thousands of people have made pilgrimages

265
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,559
It's a relic to how Freud revolutionize how we understand the human mind

266
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
The couch especially Freud couch

267
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,191
It came to symbolize an invitation to open your mind

268
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Have to let someone

269
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
That's fine scholar Michael Ross

270
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
Reminder that

271
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
We have the ability

272
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
To reveal our sin

273
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
And that's

274
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
It's irresistible

275
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,831
Take a Magic Carpet I can get on the couch and suddenly I'll say things that

276
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
Reveal white what I really love

277
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
I put my whole life

278
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
Pretending to love other things

279
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
How to get on the couch and suddenly

280
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
I say

281
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
My mother she ruined my life

282
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,127
Michael Roth loves his mother

283
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
But if you didn't and he does

284
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
It might be revealed on the couch

285
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
Whole number of complexes

286
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,719
Abby on creating a vocabulary of the mind he gave us a place to rest

287
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
Ephelides

288
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,839
The share our desires are in Ambitions are dreams

289
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143
A place just to lie down

290
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Can't talk

291
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,631

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

296
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,231
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

297
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
If

298
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:30,655

310
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,983
Makes for a much more natural
