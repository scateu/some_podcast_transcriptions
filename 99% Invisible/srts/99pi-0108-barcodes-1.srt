This is 99% invisible

25
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
I'm Roman Mars

26
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
This sound is on mistake

27
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
Maybe you find it kind of like I do since it signifies the end of a trip to the grocery store

28
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,832
You found all the things on your list and now you get to just stand there and zone out for a second or flip through a gossip mag

29
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
Checkout person does the work that's our new producer Katie mingle I myself find that sound

30
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
A bit anxiety-inducing since it's also the sound of the total that I'm going to have to pay

31
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,960
Going up and up and up

32
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
And

33
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,848
When I go to the grocery store and check out

34
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:55,968
I'm utterly amazed at how well the stairs can read barcodes

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,808
No I don't tell the checkout people my wife always do

36
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,880
My husband here is the one that invented the barcode

37
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,464
I like those kind of look at yourself to say yeah I believe that

38
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Course today

39
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,280
They would look at you in SF

40
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
To say you mean

41
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
There was a time they didn't have a barcode

42
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,448
It's hard to imagine now a world without barcode

43
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
A world

44
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,264
Without George lure

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
Hello hello

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,848
George J laurer

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
I'm the one

48
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,456
The UPC barcode

49
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
And symbol

50
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040
In 1973

51
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,112
Found some of you might be saying to yourselves

52
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,928
I thought Joseph Woodland invented the barcode

53
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
Maybe you're saying that to yourself

54
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,768
You are a nerd

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
And I love you

56
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
And just hold your nerd horses because

57
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
We're getting to Woodland ride

58
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Now

59
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
It started the way a lot of thing

60
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
People trying to make

61
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
More money

62
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
Video

63
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Grocery business

64
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,504
Decided that they needed some way to reduce their overhead

65
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,112
One of the main places they felt they were losing money was the checkout line

66
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,464
They came up with the idea of having some kind of a scannable

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Code

68
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,304
Which would move people more quickly through the line

69
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,400
One of the first people that started working on it with an engineer named Joseph

70
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Woodland

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,544
After working on the Manhattan Project Woodland moved on to develop an Innovative way to produce

72
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
Elevator music

73
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,872
He was jamming on this project

74
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:33,760
Probably set to make a whole bunch of money until and this is according to Woodlands New York Times obituary

75
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
His father forbid him

76
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
Getting into the industry because it was

77
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
Controlled by the mob

78
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,768
So Woodland moved on from elevator music

79
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
2 barcodes

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,704
He was trying to come up with a symbol that when scanned would translate to a series of numbers that a computer could use

81
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
Identify a product

82
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,312
So one day he's sitting on the beach in Miami Florida

83
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
So the legend goes

84
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,920
And Woodlands thinking about his days in the Boy Scouts and more

85
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,736
As one tends to do on the beach

86
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,808
Any kind of absent-mindedly drawing in the sand with

87
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
His fingers

88
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
When suddenly he looks down

89
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
And he's got it

90
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,488
He's dragged his four fingers through the sand in the shape

91
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
A concentric circles

92
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,351
Instead of dot dot dot dash dash dash he thinks

93
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
Can you skinny and wide lines

94
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
Bullseye bullseye

95
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,031
The very first barcodes were in the shape of a bullseye

96
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
Actually they didn't call them barcodes yet

97
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:34,687
Woodlands convention was called a classifying apparatus and method

98
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,991
I'm really glad that we don't call him that anymore

99
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
That was 1948

100
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
About 20 years

101
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
The bullseye idea gathered.

102
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
The scanners and other equipment needed to put the system in place we're just too expensive for any of it to be feasible

103
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,095
Fast forward to 1970s

104
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:59,007
The technology is now a bit more affordable and a group of Supermarket executive led by a guy named Allen have

105
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
I like okay

106
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
Barcode or bust

107
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
Doing this

108
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,455
By that time there were a few other designs out there but none were purse

109
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,367
So they put together a list of qualities that their ideal barcode would have and ask 14 different companies to come up with

110
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
The Proposal

111
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,439
Could be no larger than one of those

112
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
1 1/2 square inches

113
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
How to have a good enough depth

114
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
Brookfield liquor to read

115
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,655
About a foot-and-a-half above the scanner had to be omnidirectional

116
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
That's George lower again

117
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
He was working at IBM at the

118
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,311
The time which was one of the companies competing to make the best

119
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
And most people thought

120
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,407
That a circular design like Woodlands

121
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,223
Would probably work best because of the way the scanners were

122
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Those days

123
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
Just about every scanner

124
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
Was a single one

125
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
And you can just picture that if you had a single line and it was going in the direction of the bar it would not read

126
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
All the bars

127
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
Women's original circular design solved

128
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,143
Because it could be read from any direction

129
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,983
Batman the checkout person didn't have to take your bag of Cheetos and

130
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Turn it in just the right wave

131
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
Before I could pass over the scanner

132
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,383
But George didn't think the bullseye symbol would work

133
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
I couldn't

134
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
Support

135
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:15,551
That is the solution to what the grocery industry wanted

136
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Because

137
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,207
To me there was no way that it would fulfill their specifications

138
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,559
My Integrity just would not let me come up with a

139
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Willow

140
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
Bunch of bull

141
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
So George went back to the drawing paper

142
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
My wife said life

143
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
Came back and I will work on it day and night

144
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
Come back at night

145
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,175
Again most of us was thinking arithmetic

146
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,759
Trying to prove that this would work

147
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:51,391
Also I have to admit how to disprove that some of the others wouldn't work

148
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
Ultimately came up with a rectangular barcode that fit more code into less space which was crucial since

149
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:03,935
Grocery manufacturers were already grumbling about having to make room for this new symbol on their packaging

150
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,263
But there was still the issue of the one line scanner

151
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,359
Somehow we got the idea that if we used an X

152
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
For the span powder

153
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,503
Which could be developed very easily with a pair of mirrors

154
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,879
The barcode can be read by the scanner and no matter which way it was oriented has it passed

155
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:28,767
Do even though Woodland came up with the original idea of using lines of various widths

156
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
George lure did more than dust

157
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
Teams that shape

158
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
From a circle to a rectangle

159
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,679
Improved on the symbol

160
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
The code behind the symbol

161
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,263
And the scanners that read the symbol

162
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
Even Joe Woodland thought so

163
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,103
Joe Woodland was

164
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,663
Very enthusiastic he worked with me

165
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,735
In fact he wrote the actual proposal

166
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,295
For the submission to the grocery industry

167
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
But it was

168
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
My

169
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:58,207
Invention of the particular symbol and barcode that we see today

170
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
The symbol selection

171
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
Committee unanimously voted

172
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
For George loros

173
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
Rectangular symbol in code

174
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
They called it the universal product

175
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
Kotor UPC

176
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,007
A year later in 1974

177
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
Pack of Wrigley's chewing gum

178
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,359
Became the first item to ever be scanned

179
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
With the UPC barcode

180
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
If barcodes engine invented

181
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,887
The entire layout of the architecture of Commerce would have been different

182
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,703
It impacts are very difficult to

183
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Boris

184
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,079
My name is Sanjay Sharma and a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT

185
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,943
Sanjay Sarma has also worked with an organization called gs1

186
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
Afghans for Global standards one

187
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
And if you need a barcode on your product

188
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
You have to go

189
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Do gs-12 get

190
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Imagine

191
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
Delta telephone numbers 1 standardized

192
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,511
Bryce Canyon area codes

193
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,815
Two people can have the same phone number

194
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,447
When barcodes became the standard they didn't just make checkout lines faster

195
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:18,591
Payload stores to keep track of huge amounts of inventory and the collect data on what we were buying

196
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,175
Data they could use to keep us coming back for more

197
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,991
Without bar codes exist

198
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,599
But equally small store might need more employees

199
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,695
It's like degrees that

200
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,559
That makes a machine wrong that's one of the key you know elements of fun

201
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,375
Efficiency in our capitalistic system

202
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,471
When you put it like that you can see why for some people

203
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:50,591
The barcode has come to represent everything they hate about capitalism and consumerism

204
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:55,455
You can get wrapped candies every time bubble gum lollipop Fun Size candy bars

205
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:02,111
Just a dollar 89

206
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
Sellouts

207
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Barcodes fall

208
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,511
But it's become the symbol or the glyph of

209
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,607
Technology we're afraid of don't understand or being

210
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,167
Cog in a wheel in a larger

211
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
Monolithic machine

212
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:24,383
The Matrix if you will owe why will my name is Jeri Whiting I'm the founder of Azealia soft we are here in

213
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Seattle Washington

214
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
I've been

215
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,991
Writing software that prints barcodes

216
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:35,391
For 25 years now they aren't bad they aren't good they're just tools but most people look at them and don't even know where to

217
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Start

218
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,999
So let's demystify for a minute and look at what's inside the barcode

219
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,863
Again what we're talking about here is the UPC barcode that George lure invented

220
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,191
Is the barcode that you and I and everyone in the world

221
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
Has had the most interaction with

222
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
The UPC barcode is divided into

223
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
2/2

224
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,871
It's actually two barcode sitting right neck

225
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
Each other

226
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,967
You can see this visually because there are these longer bars that

227
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
Come down in the middle and on each side

228
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
Those are called the guard bars

229
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,415
The guard bars tell the scanner that the code is starting and ending

230
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,767
The left half of the barcode tells you who the manufacturer is

231
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
And the right have tells you which

232
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
Particular product

233
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:21,215
And this was something I didn't realize the scanner is reading both the light and the dark light

234
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
Don't understand the standard just consider yourself

235
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
The darkroom

236
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,919
Where the wall behind you as far as painted on it

237
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
And you took a flashlight

238
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
And shined it over your head

239
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
Across the bars

240
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
You would see

241
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,159
The room got a little lighter when you were over the white bars

242
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
And it would get dark

243
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
When it was over the top

244
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:49,631
Black lines that don't reflect the laser light back to the scanner register as a 1 White Lines equal 0

245
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:54,239
They're actually 95 evenly spaced columns on a UPC barcode

246
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
I think black line is actually

247
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
A bunch of ones right next to each other

248
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,663
The computer add all that together and you get a string of 12 numbers

249
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,735
This number goes to the computer

250
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,063
The computer no looks up and it's table

251
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
To get the information

252
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
Such as

253
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,695
What is the product how much they're charging for it

254
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
But that is not in the barcode

255
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
The only thing that's in the barcode

256
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
Is where the computer should look

257
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,911
This number is also printed below the barcode just in case this

258
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
Scanner isn't working

259
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
Which for me really makes

260
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,031
The whole mystery a little

261
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Anticlimactic

262
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
I mean

263
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Right there

264
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:37,503
So when most people until recently thought of barcodes they thought of something that was

265
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
Is a combination of bars and Stripes

266
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,415
More recently two-dimensional barcodes which are

267
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
They look like crossword puzzles

268
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,095
Have emerged in most popular being QR barcodes quick response

269
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
That are scanned by cell phones

270
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,447
We've all seen these and maybe a few of us

271
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:01,823
I'm actually bothered to pull out our cell phones and download the app required to scan them

272
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,383
Yeah there's something about them that I find kind of

273
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
Lame or annoying

274
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
You know it's like

275
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,855
No Chili's I don't want more info on the Bloomin Onion

276
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
So anyway I Googled why are QR codes

277
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,535
Lame and I got a bunch of Articles basically saying they're actually really useful they're just

278
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
Being misused

279
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,655
Mostly by advertisers who just started slapping them on every single thing

280
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
But Jerry Whiting

281
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
He still believes in them

282
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
The nice thing about QR barcodes

283
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
Says they are not Justa

284
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
I'll look up number

285
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,615
To an external data

286
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
Yes it could be a chunk attack

287
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
It can be a URL

288
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
It can be a whole lot of different

289
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
But

290
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,063
There is no Central Authority

291
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,623
The tells you what or how to do anything

292
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,719
Meaning you don't have to go through gs1 to get a QR code

293
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:57,119
Which lets people do stuff like make a giant picture of Amy Goodman's face entirely out of QR codes

294
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:03,519
This is my QR code Amy Goodman portrait made with 2304 unique to Arco

295
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
Codes that link to nine years of democracy Now videos besides the QR

296
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,319
Barcode Lauren Woodland original barcode of bunch of other park has their use for all sorts of things

297
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,975
There's code 128 which is mostly used for packaging and shipping there's PostNet which is used by the post office

298
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:30,655
Their bar codes that use radio frequencies to send out there called RFID tags and they aren't really

299
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
Are coats at all

300
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:37,567
They just get put in the same category because like barcodes they're being used to keep track of inventory

301
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:44,479
With a grocery cart full of RFID tag items one could conceivably wheel their car through a big

302
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,039
I would read all the contents all at once

303
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,439
Basically eliminating the checkout line entirely and allowing more people to pass them stores even more

304
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,255
Quickly so that we can all buy more stuff

305
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:02,399
Track prescriptions library books luggage endangered animals

306
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:06,239
There are so many barcodes on so many things that

307
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
According to Jerry Whiting

308
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,359
When Future archaeologists come across remnants of our

309
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,943
Backward a civilization and they stumble across a barcode

310
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,247
They're going to sign it religious significance

311
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
But they don't understand this

312
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Supply chain

313
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,647
We had no idea how far it was going to go

314
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,975
It we thought it would stay just within the grocery industry

315
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,119
Of course it didn't just stay in the grocery industry

316
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,191
It actually went way beyond that all the way

317
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
2 conspiracy

318
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:43,103
There is in fact a silly conspiracy theory that all barcodes have the number of the Beast

319
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Six six six

320
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
Encoded into them

321
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,527
Yeah it has to do with those guard bars that come at the beginning middle and end of every Park

322
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
Barcode

323
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,647
And it's basically true that there is three sixes coded into the guard bars

324
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,951
The answer to why is a bit

325
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,023
Technically you can read about it on George lures

326
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
Personal website in the FAQ

327
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583

After we were done with our interview he was talking a little bit more about him

334
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
Job at IBM

335
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,735
Hello my dad come home at night

336
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
My poor wife

337
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,903
And then he started talking about his wife

338
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Kids

339
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,023
She had the hard job she gave up her career

340
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Electrician career

341
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
In order to take care of it

342
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
Believe me we are so proud

You just couldn't ask for better kids

345
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
So this is because my wife

346
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
Spread her career

347
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407

00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
I'm just home

349
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
Does that sound like a Satan worshipper

350
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
