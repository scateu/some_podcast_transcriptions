I first found Nico by staring at the sidewalks vigil is a journalist from San Francisco one of my favorite things is

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
Going to get lost in San Francisco and stare at things that I normally might have looked past and then I saw his name written the sidewalk

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,624
I thought it was interesting and then the block later found his name again

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Beach and I found another one you know I would find them not just to North Beach with Chinatown Russian Hill Telegraph Hill they were

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,864

I'm just saying to myself

44
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
Dam Nico is everywhere

45
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,920
And then I looked down and it said

46
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,528
I know I felt like a dude and I remember thinking that I'd this is my duty to write the story and then

47
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
Coincidentally I'd run across

48
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
John doody

49
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,768
So Delphine decided to track Nico down and I want to know if this guy Ally Why did you do it was the first time I've ever felt like I was the one

50
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:19,168
Pay attention in class attack started in 1967 because I saw the date 1967 I figured you must have been about

51
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
12 years old

52
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
In some ways I got to watch him grow up because I felt like his personality kind of got a little more Boulder Through The Years earliest F Majesty

53
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,688
And later on you concept artist

54
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:36,064
I figured he went to school in the neighborhood so I went to the High School Galileo and I went to Francisco Middle School

55
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,160
And so I would start photocopying yearbook pictures from the 60s and 70s

56
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,232
And I would face this on guys who look like they just had that

57
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,328
Artful Dodger look in their eye

58
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,888

And getting nowhere live right now you're thinking I love this Nico kid He's My Hero 2

61
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Wait for it

62
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
Here it comes

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
I was by the North Beach playground

64
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
I believe it was rainy day

65
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
And rainy days are always the best days

66
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
To read the

67
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
Because it washed away a lot

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,880
Could read things that on other days you probably couldn't see

69
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
And I saw this etching

70
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:16,768
That was the longest that I've ever seen it took over an entire sidewalk blah

71
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,303
It was like a paragraph

72
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,167
I think it said

73
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
Right now

74
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983

75
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,311
First word begin with an n

76
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
I can actually say for sure I mean I can presume what it said

77
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,967
You probably can too but that those of those letters were actually washed away

78
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Foot traffic

79
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,063
And then I found quite a few others and it was

80
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,623
Yeah I'm never talking 10 15 20

81
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
As far as I could tell from the and ride

82
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
I didn't want to believe it

83
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
Cuz it didn't go with

84
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
You know what identified with

85
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
I mean to some extent I wanted to identify as

86
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,703
Loner kid in the city 2 and this happened right before I go

87
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
Finally found it

88
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
One of the leads finally panned out

89
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
Can I prolong email Court

90
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
Delphine vigil grabbed his notebook and my

91
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Microcassette

92
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407

93
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Nico

94
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
How did unabomber get caught

95
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247
I like Chinese shoes

96
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
Can I cure tiny shoes

97
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,855
I like you drop something

98
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
How many things you've done

99
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,511
At least it.

100
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
Neko describe all the places

101
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,655
Tagged in detail and Delphine believes the vast majority of them

102
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
From this one guy

103
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
My thoughts were that

104
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
If I do this really

105
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
Do it right

106
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,639
This stuff will last way in the future

107
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,735
The concert will be all washed away

108
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,575
It's kind of like any store you get into and you have a hunch about it a lot of

109
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
It was very close to

110
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,671
What I imagine a lot of it was completely different

111
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
He did have a very Artful Dodger lifestyle

112
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
His father was out of the picture

113
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
And

114
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327

Kind of like a real Carefree parenting style he was just this

117
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Kid who

118
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
We're sort of in some ways forgotten

119
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,591
And after a few meetings Delphine finally found the opportunity.

120
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
To ask the hard questions

121
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175

126
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
I I can pick out about 15 to 20

127
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
Same to me would be the same guy who didn't

128
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
But if I'm wrong

129
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543

136
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,063

137
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
That we were out

138
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927

139
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,607

And that explanation would sit better if the past wasn't written in concrete

144
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
I'm not reading my name and I've written his name

145

And what color

146
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
In fact that was the first

147
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
Line I wrote for the story was in the sidewalk

148
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,975
Walk up Montgomery Street to the Union Street steps and make a right at Green Street and

149
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,535
Right there unless it was double parked on top of

150
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815

151
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
