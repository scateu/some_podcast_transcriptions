This is 99% invisible

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm Roman Mars

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,216
Back in the late 1980s

23
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,544
When Louis guy was a little kid growing up in Columbia

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,104
His brother didn't have babysitters

25
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,640
They had bodyguards

26
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,040
His parents would send them to school in an SUV that was accompanied by another identical as UV

27
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,576
Which was a decoy

28
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,392
Because that meant if one of the vehicles was attacked

29
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,184
It would be a chance we would not be

30
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
That's Lewis

31
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,024
Are life is strange in many ways back then

32
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,072
My brother and I had our own bedroom

33
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,144
But every night our whole family would sleep in the same room

34
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,240
It had a door to the back patio and a ladder ready to use in case we need it to

35
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,568
My parents made it seem like we were just having a slumber party

36
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,736
But the real reason that Louis's family took these precautions is that Lewis's dad was a captain in the anti-narcotics

37
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
Unit for Colombia's National Police

38
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Pablo Escobar

39
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
Notorious drug lord

40
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,904
I declare war on the police

41
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,464
On the whole Colombian state relay

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,584
It's become a typical day in Colombia three more judges who quit their jobs after being tracking

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,632
By the murderous drug cartels

44
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,448
The government has imposed a curfew in nine cities

45
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,008
In the heart of cocaine country including

46
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,056
The cartels Capital Medellin

47
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
Today the

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,616
The late 80s and early 90s

49
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,688
Esqueleto supplying 80% of the world's cocaine

50
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,016
And environment surrounding the drug trade have gotten really bad

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
The epicenter of the violence was minnijean

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
Escobar's cartel was based at

53
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
And they control

54
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,328
13 bombs have gone off and Midian since the weekend all aimed a government owned Banks or state liquor stores

55
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,656
Marine became the most dangerous city in the world

56
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,752
In 1991 alone around 6000 people were killed

57
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,104
The murder rate was almost 400 people per 100 thousand residents

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
Which to put things in perspective

59
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:01,248
That's three or four times more than the most violent cities in the world today

60
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
But today me the genie is very different

61
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
In just 30 years

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,416
It's changed from being the bloody cooking capital of the world

63
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,720
Into a place that's often described as a model

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
It's no safer than many cities in the US

65
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
And amazingly

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,888
What are the things that helped to pull the city out of the vile

67
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,448
What's a whole new approach to urban planning

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
Including a major overhaul

69
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
Best cities public transportation

70
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,616
Lewis's family experience Colombia's many changes

71
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
Louis is now a journalist

72
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,712
Annie's going to help us tell the story of what happened

73
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,064
Along with Maria Elena HOSA the host of NPR's Latino USA

74
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,392
She covered the violence in Medellin back in the 1980s

75
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,232
And she went back again last year to explore the city with Luis

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Alright so funny

77
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
So we are here in downtown Meridian

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,424
You were here 30 years ago

79
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
What was it like

80
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
Yeah I know I remember that when we

81
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
Came to this

82
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Circular Park

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
I just remember walking here

84
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
I'm feeling very afraid

85
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
Feeling very afraid because

86
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
Everybody knew that at any moment

87
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
Anywhere a bumpkin

88
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,928
Our story today is a collaboration with

89
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
Latino USA

90
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,095
Marine sits in a valley surrounded by steep Green Mountain

91
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
In the cities early days

92
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
The mountains were undeveloped

93
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,775
During the first half of the 20th century the city rapidly industrialized

94
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,127
More and more people came to Medellin for manufacturing and textile jobs

95
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,479
And it began building homes and communities of the sides of those mountains

96
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,807
These informal settlements became known as camunas

97
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,647
The community really thought of as separate from the rest of the city below

98
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,975
Both because of their geographical distance from downtown

99
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
And also because it would neglect

100
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
By city government

101
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
Didn't receive the same Services as other neighborhood

102
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
Public transit

103
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,751
It would take more than an hour to get from the farthest camunas to the city center

104
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,311
People in the community essay

105
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
I need to go to Marine to run an errand

106
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
Even though they were technically living and Maddie

107
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,991
But as the manufacturing economy boomed

108
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
And look the other way

109
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,647
Until the hills above the city were crowded with houses

110
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
Stack on top of each other like colorful box

111
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:24,351
But by the 1980s many of Columbia's manufacturing jobs are moving overseas

112
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,399
And is manufacturing with tanking

113
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
The drug trade skyrocketing

114
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,287
The Medellin cartel began recruiting young people mostly young men

115
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
From the kimonos

116
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,151
These were young people who felt disconnected from the water City

117
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,967
And they didn't have a lot of other options for jobs

118
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
American Odyssey

00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,599
I was quite a stir Escuela del Barrio La Paz

El Lugar donde nacio

122
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,951
This is Manuel espinazo

123
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:54,815
He says that back in 1989 he live two blocks from where Pablo Escobar grew up

124
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,119
And his group of friends had to make a choice

125
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
To be seduced by the drug trafficking life

126
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
Where to continue studying

127
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,543
You were having to make that decision am I going to be

128
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,359
Going in suddenly making Fast Money dealing drugs

129
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,687
Or were you going to kind of you know becoming something else

130
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,759
What what did that look like

131
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,391
Amigos que aparecen con Moto con Carro

132
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
Completa Para

133
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,231
Started seeing friends with motorcycle

134
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
Golden knights Club

135
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,839
They talked about working for the narcos for a few months to get fast cash

136
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
They have money to party on the weekend

137
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
She got the

138
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
Hand soap bubble bath

139
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,919
By this point Pablo Escobar have been running the Medellin cartel for more than a decade

140
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,015
Forbes Magazine had recently billionaires issue

141
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
With a provocative headline

142
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
Presidente Don Pablo

143
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
And that wasn't a huge stretch

144
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695
Through his network of informants

145
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
Escobar control module managing in other parts of the country

146
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
He cultivated a Robinhood Type image

147
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
Building housing and soccer fields in the community

148
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
He was a hero to some of his friends

149
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,751
Johanna konta

150
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Bluebird

151
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311
Monroe said she plays soccer on a dirt

152
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
And the games would end at sundown

153
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
But one day

154
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,711
A rich man came to celebrate the construction of a new lighting

155
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
Volume to play at night

156
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
And guess who the man was

157
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,623
Periscope live

158
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,719
Monroe says that Escobar was very different from other rich man

159
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
Because he was generous

160
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
He was a benefactor

161
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,143
He was also becoming in many ways more powerful than the 11 states

162
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:40,287
To try to solve this problem Colombian law enforcement began relying on militarized policing tactic

163
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:45,151
Increasingly violent clashes started happening between the cartel and the police

164
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,503
Law enforcement will go into the Kahuna's to try to control the drug trafficking

165
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
And sometimes they'd end up killing young men from those neighborhood

166
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,951
Then after years of conflict between Escobar and Colombian authorities

167
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,255
The US started its War on Drugs

168
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,327
And passed an extradition agreement with the Colombian government

169
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
That meant

170
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,423
That if or when Escobar was captured

171
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,263
He could potentially spend the rest of his life in a US prison

172
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
The violent Imaging got a lot worse

173
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,223
It may have been a bomb that blew up a plane in Columbia today the Boeing 727 of Avianca airline November of

174
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,807
1989 the Medellin cartel bombed in Avianca aircraft

175
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Mid-flight

176
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,135
Killing all 117 people on board

177
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,463
The cartel was trying to kill a Colombian presidential candidate

178
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:37,119
The bombing of flight 203 with the deadliest single attack in decades of violence in Colombia

179
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
Two Americans were among the Dead

180
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,495
Counting been President George HW Bush

181
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,591
To offer support to the Colombian forces in their search for Escobar

182
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
With additional American resources

183
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,735
The operatives trained to capture Escobar Mountain doesn't have real

184
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,319
But he had so many informants in the government but he kept on getting away

185
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
And he retaliated

186
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
Dominican cartel when I'm a killing spree

187
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
The ship Columbia

188
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
Especially managing

189
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
To its foundation

190
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,375
This was when the city became the murder capital of the world

191
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:15,519
Sandra Reina Stacy was total chaos

192
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
She's a sociologist in mini Jean

193
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,895
Who started the armed conflict and how it affected the city

194
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
Regular assassination

195
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
And fight among rival gangs

196
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,743
Denver car bombs going off all the time

197
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
La Casa de papel

198
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,839
She says that a sense of fear to cover the streets

199
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
There was a feeling that anyone could die at any time

200
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
Medellin cartel members are police office

201
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Anyone

202
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:53,151
Public spaces that had once been Lively started emptying out

203
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,223
To maintain control the cartel imposed a curfew

204
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,039
Escobar's men with rose leaflets from Ellicott

205
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,623
Ordering people to stay inside past 8 p.m.

206
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
The violence felt indiscriminate

207
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,511
I did not describe a terrorist like a long black night

208
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
Love you Missy Misdemeanor

209
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Of Escobar's top lieutenant

210
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
Only four are left alive today

211
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,567
And three of them are still in prison abroad

212
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
The only one who is alive and in Columbia today

213
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
Is John Jairo Velasquez

214
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
Also known as

215
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
Or Popeye in English

216
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,367
Ciento ochenta en el ano Mas importante

217
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,975
The year 1999 was the most important thing that was a war

218
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,071
That's Popeye Pablo Escobar's right hand man and top assassin

219
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:48,959
He served 23 years in prison but he can still vividly recall the most intense year of the conflict

220
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,383
Fighting in the streets we are killing police officers and having shootouts in the

221
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,455
Streets block by block car bombs are going off in managing

222
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,295
Popeye would eventually admit to killing over 250 people

223
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
And for this

224
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
He had help

225
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:12,255
Used to operate in the camunas getting to know the young man who lived in those impoverished and ignored neighborhoods on the outskirts

226
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
Parts of the city

227
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,351
Then he'd recruit them and train them a sicario

228
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Or Hitman

229
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,447
Escobar and his top leaders like propane

230
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:24,287
I figured out how to exploit the geographic fragmentation of managing

231
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,615
They knew the kids in the camunas didn't have a lot of opportunities

232
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
And so that's where they focus their effort

233
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
Even though he can't resist recruiting in a way

234
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,807
Talking about how exciting it was to work for Escobar

235
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:41,951
Meetup powerscore amigo

236
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,279
Pablo Escobar for us was not a boss or a friend

237
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
He was a god

238
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,119
I recorded a video Never

239
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
We would eat up a table with him

240
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
We were in his orgies

241
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,543
We would die for Pablo and would go to prison for him

242
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
Demolition cartel was a big

243
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
Family

244
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,735
When Maria in xhosa Louisa's reporting partner with a younger reporter

245
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,343
She came to Medellin to cover the conflict for Rolling Stone and other news outlets

246
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
And she remembers getting threats from the cartel

247
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
Popeye tells her that yeah

248
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
She was being watched

249
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,095
Made a loud message characters in potassium

250
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Yeah that's right

251
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,215
The boss always notify the journalist

252
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,519
You should thank God we didn't kill you

253
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,615
Risk of us killing you because in a war you have to shoot

254
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Everyone

255
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
Zero Maria

256
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Let's be honest

257
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
We were at War

258
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
I'm worried that my father also fart

259
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
As a captain for Colombia's National Police

260
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:47,999
Because of his father's rule Lewis and his brother had to learn things in most little kids don't have to learn about

261
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:52,863
Like when Louis was five or six years old there was an explosion at a mall next door

262
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,423
It was strange because it was so close to our house

263
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
And I remember asking my mother if it was safe to return to the mall

264
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,871
My father left it on to narcotics unit and join the National oil

265
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
He was the head of security and Logistics

266
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,247
FRAM oil pipeline being built through dangerous

267
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Territory

268
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
He went to both Norco control and

269
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Infarct territory

270
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
The farc

271
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
Short for the Revolutionary armed forces of Colombia wear a leftist guerrilla group who took up arms against the government in 19

272
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
N64

273
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
By the late 80s

274
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,911
They were the largest Rebel group in Latin America

275
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
And at the same time as the Medellin cartel

276
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,775
They started drug trafficking and kidnapping

277
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
To fund their war against the state

278
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
One weekend

279
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,687
While my mother and my brother and I were out of town visiting my grandmother

280
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,319
Turn on the TV and saw the breaking news that the farc rebels have attacked a pipeline where my father was working

281
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
The news anchor said Rebels had taken hostage

282
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,695
In one of those hostages with my father

283
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,047
In the past when he was with the National Police

284
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,631
My father had fought the same fight insurgents and they knew who he was

285
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Their enemy

286
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Plus

287
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
My father was easy to recognize

288
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:07,359
Standing Tall at about 6:43 slim with an arrow pride and elegance that made him stick out in the crowd

289
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
So in my mother's house on TV

290
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
She said she knew my father would die

291
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,831
The farc rebels eventually freed elderhostel

292
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
But it kept my father

293
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
They held a war Tribunal

294
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
And then execute

295
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
Right before his death

296
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,631
My father was able to leave a message that would later get passed on to my mother

297
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,447
He told her that she knew how to be strong

298
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
They have prepared for this moment

299
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,799
It was not her duty to races

300
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
And get ahead in life

301
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
And that he was sorry

302
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
He was sorry that I'm at right now

303
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Suddenly

304
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
How old are you

305
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
It was almost 6

306
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,135
Machinery was paid for by the military the National Police

307
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
The whole ceremony

308
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
Surreal

309
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
And remember like at the funeral home

310
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
And I kept messing like when he's going to wake up

311
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,167
So why it's over it's over like when is he going to wake up and play

312
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
Just like my family

313
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,799
There are many other families in Medina where morning

314
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
The same year my father's dad

315
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
In 1991

316
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
The city's murder rate

317
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,783
The cartel created fear to the idea that violence can strike anyone

318
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
Anytime

319
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,903
Around the same time Escobar made a deal with the Colombian state

320
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:30,303
Yes traditional Colombian citizen to the US have been prohibited by a newly approved Colombian Constitution

321
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
So that possibility was now off the table

322
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,471
Escobar agreed to surrender to authorities and to stop all criminal activity

323
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,799
In exchange for a reduced sentence and preferential treatment

324
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
Including no extradition

325
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
To the United States

326
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,687
And he got very preferential treatment

327
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,271
Escobar was locked up in his own luxurious private prison

328
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,063
But Bill specially for him

329
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
He was called to like at the door

330
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,439
And it featured a soccer field a bar a giant dollhouse

331
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
A jacuzzi and a waterfall

332
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:05,375
Then it became clear that Escobar was continuing to orchestrate criminal activities from within the prison

333
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,191
Authorities made plans to move them to a new location

334
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,495
But Escobar escaped before they could

335
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
There was a man hun

336
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,079
December 1993

337
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
Escobar died in a shootout

338
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,711
But even before Escobar died

339
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,063
The city had undertaken an ambitious new project to try to figure out

340
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:29,183
How to pull Marine out of a drug-fueled violence that affected the city for so long

341
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487

343
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
This is Sandra arenas

344
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,143
She says that it was during the worst of the violence

345
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,471
That means you got to figure out the formula for its own transformation

346
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:50,431
What happened was a national government sent policymakers out into the neighborhood submitting especially the Kahuna's

347
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
To hold public forums and to meet

348
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
People from all across the city

349
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,855

Colossians Sarita

357

Arena says that in the Forum

358
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,127
They figured out that the city needed to reclaim public spaces

359
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
Places where people to meet up and talk

360
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,271
Many of these spaces like parks and plazas

361
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:30,623
I've been abandoned because people were afraid to be outside with all the violence

362
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,207
People also said the city needed to invest in community group

363
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,583
They were already lots of artists collectors and Community organizations doing important work in the community

364
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
They just needed more support

365
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:48,031
And finally the city could no longer neglect and ignore the camunas on the steep hills above the city center

366
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,615
Those neighborhoods needed to be integrated with the rest of medine

367
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,431
City needed a modern Metro System

368
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:59,807
Transporte publico Imaging

369
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
That's Natalia castano

370
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:07,231
And she says that the public transportation system became a way to create a sense of inclusion throughout the city

371
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Castanos anarchist

372
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,631
And she helped to implement some of the ideas that came out of those early Community meetings

373
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:20,287
In 1995 the mini Metro opened linking parts of the previously fragmented City

374
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,151
The richest southern district was now easily connected with the poor camunas to the north

375
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:29,503
In the moment

376
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
Los active building

377
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
Natalia says

378
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,647
They were living in the time when violent attacks

379
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,951
Car bombs and assassinations were common

380
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,231
And obviously

381
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
Dimetra infrastructure

382
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Target

383
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,119
The drug cartel Hitmen were part of the conservative managing culture

384
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
And many of them are cats

385
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,751
So the city came up with the idea of placing a statue of the Virgin Mary

386
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,287
And it's one of the metro state

387
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,127
They thought it would be a reminder to keep things calm and peaceful on the train

388
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
To complement the Metro

389
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
The City built something else

390
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:06,111
An Innovative system of cable cars that went right up the Steep Mountain sides to link the comunas to the rest of the city

391
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,671
And this made a huge difference

392
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,535
It wants taken people in the community over an hour to get to the city center

393
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,351
Now it took more like 15 or 20 minutes

394
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Before

395
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,959
People in the community used to say I need to go to managing to run an errand

396
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Now

397
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
The feel like they were part of managing

398
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
Like they belong

399
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,127
There was other investment in the communitu

400
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,431
City built Big public libraries

401
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
Parks soccer field

402
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,759
Job training centers in health clinic

403
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,623
And they poured money into already existing artist collectives and Community organization

404
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:45,279
Natalia says it's because the city had come to realize that

405
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
Odell Beckham Una

406
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Does neighborhood

407
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887
Happy neglected and underserved in the path

408
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:55,775
And wait Marines big innovation was to Taco crime and violence not three more policing

409
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,079
But to urban planning infrastructure

410
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
And social programs

411
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,687
The invested in neighborhoods that have been the most isolated

412
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,527
And where the cartels had previously had the most success recruiting members

413
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
And the city started to change

414
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,415
Commute times dropped soccer field state lit up into the night

415
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:17,535
The city of some bills inviting new outdoor spaces and the streets became busy again

416
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,327
And along with all these changes

417
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,119
The murder rate plummeted

418
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,519
By 90% from its peak in 1991 to today

419
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,687
The approach to urban planning that developed in Medellin has now become known as social urbanism

420
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
It was a Grassroots approach

421
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
Not a top-down one

422
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,855
And people all over the world now look to Medellin as an example

423
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
How to do this well

424
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,743
Of course there were other reasons the violence decline in Medellin

425
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,327
Medellin cartel was dismantled the economy was getting stronger

426
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,167
In a series of progressive mirrors kept building on each other's work

427
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,263
Urban planning and public transportation did play a big role

428
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,079
But yet I wanted to see this change for sales

429
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
So we better wait

430
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
Comuna 13

431
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
Historically

432
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,735
One of the most violent and stigmatized neighborhoods in the city

433
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,575
Comuna 13 is a dense neighborhood built on a steep Hillside

434
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,135
And now running right up to the middle of

435
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
Are these massive

436
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,696
Outdoor escalator

437
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,768
What is an escalator doing in the middle of a

438
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,048
Outdoor

439
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,072
Community

440
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
And there's another escalator

441
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
Wow

442
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,448
Just the notion that you're writing escalators

443
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
Up a hill

444
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,544
Literally and it's taking you to the top of the city

445
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,848
On escalators that are Outdoors

446
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
But you're also seeing it everywhere you turn there's art there's a huge mural Arts at every turn

447
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,856
Off of the top of the escalator

448
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,648
Boosie huge paintings

449
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,440
And kids breakdancing and beatboxing

450
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,048
30 years ago this neighborhood was a dangerous place

451
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,096
Please would have been afraid to come here

452
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
And now it's flourishing

453
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,192
The art and color interests

454
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,472
From all over the world

455
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
Yeah

456
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,080
Foreign tourism has gone up by

457
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,896
By 250% in Colombia in last decade

458
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,456
And many of those tourists are coming

459
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,528
Actually because of the Cities drug trafficking Legacy

460
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,576
It's something the locals

461
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
Call Norco Torres

462
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:25,280
Even Popeyes cashing in on the interest in this type of Tourism which is only been Amplified by the hit Netflix show narcos

463
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,096
He leads drug-related tours of Medellin

464
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
Taking people to sites around the city

465
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,192
Like Pablo Escobar's grave

466
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:36,800
Hey guys were you emojis city services

467
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:41,920
I'm here with Popeye. Killer

468
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,040
And it's good that Medellin is safe enough for tourists now

469
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,112
But there's also something uncomfortable

470
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:56,512
About knowing that Popeye is now profiting off a glorified version of the city's violent past

471
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,680
The city has a complicated relationship with his kind of Narco tourism

472
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:08,032
When the main Narco tourism sites is a place called if you seal Monaco

473
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,616
It's the building compound for Pablo Escobar used to live with his family

474
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,896
Interests

475
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
Love to visit at

476
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,224
Benin's current mayor

477
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
Federico Gutierrez

478
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,088
Says that there are actually planning to tear down at fucl Monica

479
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,624
No I won't tell you more later

480
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:27,232
Yeah you almost a construir en parque in ornithology

481
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,072
He says that he makes plays they're going to build a park in remembrance of the victims

482
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,888
Not to hide the history but to transform it

483
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,704
Because part of healing is not forgetting

484
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,776
You have any idea when we do.

485
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,336
Anil Kapoor

486
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,712
He says that the terrible things that took place in the city can't be forgotten

487
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,272
Because that's what made the city hit rock bottom

488
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
And hitting rock bottom

489
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,368
Is what eventually make people come together again

490
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Society

491
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,488
It is undeniable that many in today is a different city

492
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,304
They're still massive inequality and drug trafficking

493
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,936
They're still criminal gangs that control parts of the city and sometimes extort people and businesses

494
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,520
But it's way more democratic inclusive and peaceful

495
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,056
And it was 30 years ago

496
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:19,712
And today you can take a trip across town that would have been impossible a few decades ago

497
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:25,344
In the morning you can get on the Metro downtown in a station decorated with Virgin Mary statue

498
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:31,744
You can ride up into the Kahuna's on the outdoor escalator that carries you pass murals and beatbox

499
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,280
And then

500
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,816
As evening descends

501
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,608
Not worrying about any curfew

502
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,448
You can hop on the cable car and Float back down the Mountainside

503
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,032
The slopes of the Communist off me behind you in the Twilight

504
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:48,896
The lights of the city center becoming clear as you draw closer and closer

505
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,456
Its streets and shops and buses

506
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
Bustling with life

507
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,296
People from all over Medellin

508
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
From all over the world

509
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
City

510
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
Finally

511
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
Connected

512
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:22,432
We'll talk more with her Porter Lewis guy out about the complexities of Narco tourism and his decision to return to Columbia

513
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,736
After years of living in the United States

514
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,344
Plus extended preview of a brand new radiotopia show called zigzag

515
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
After this

516
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,376
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

517
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
We're immersed

518
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

519
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
If

520
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,384
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

521
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,224
All hearing

522
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,248
Technology

523
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
You talk to us

524
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,320
It is a creation of Sonic trash

525
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,392
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

526
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,976
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

527
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,768
To make them more human

528
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,864
Turn the living room lights on

529
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
Okay

530
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
Dim the living room lights

531
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
50%

532
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
Okay

533
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:25,408
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

534
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,224
Makes for a much more natural experience

535
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
Turn the living room lights on

536
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,368
Dim the living room lights to 50%

537
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:43,072
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

538
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
Landscape is impacting our health

539
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,424
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

Npit

543

We need to talk about something

544
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:03,296
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet

545
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

546
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:12,512
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

547
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,816
Then it may be time to seek help

548
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:21,216
Go to oh my God. Info podcast we can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God

549
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,264
Infowars podcast

550
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Oh my God

551
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,824
Fox podcast

552
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,664
We're back with Louise Gallo we reported our story this week

553
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,992
In the late 90s about five years after his father's death

554
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,576
Louis and his family left Columbia and move to Seattle

555
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,648
Louis decided to move back to Columbia a few years ago

556
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:43,232
And we want to hear more from them about what it's been like to return

557
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:47,072
We were especially curious about his reactions to the Narco tourism

558
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
As someone who has

559
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,120
That's a very present

560
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,656
Don't connection to that history

561
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,984
So we called him up he was traveling in Spain when we don't talk

562
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:58,080
I mean I want people to come to Columbia I want people to visit the country

563
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,640
Tippecanoe understand the plays a kid

564
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,432
Get a sense of what it's really like

565
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,736
As opposed to what they see on television

566
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,320
So I think it's a positive thinking for more people are coming to Columbia

567
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
However

568
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,464
People coming only to see that part of Colombia

569
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,024
Hannah perpetuates the stigma

570
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
And perpetuates

571
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,608
Toilets that stereotype

572
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
That

573
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
But many of us

574
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
When I move move on from

575
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:29,312
And it's problematic because like many people who are coming

576
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,664
Enter Colombia into managing in visiting does the spaces

577
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,968
Define this Narrative of

578
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
Pablo Escobar

579
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,088
The violence of you know the drug bosses

580
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,160
You know a little bit seductive and entertaining

581
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,208
Wet'n'Wild the same time

582
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,512
That same narrative the same

583
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,536
History

584
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,656
Was our reality of the time right it was all reality was our

585
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
Our daily lives

586
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,776
And all that suffering was real so he wasn't just like

587
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,824
You know what TV show it was

588
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
Realtor

589
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
And

590
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,432
Is it hard for you to see the ways that

591
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,224
People like Pablo Escobar

592
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,504
Popeye

593
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,296
I've been turning these sort of

594
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Glamorized

595
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Figures

596
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:18,976
I see why this narrative entertaining for many people

597
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,280
Because it's kind of like

598
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:25,120
This Man created an Empire out of nothing more or less

599
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,912
But at the same time

600
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
Yeah they're good time

601
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:35,104
Get that they are responsible Pablo Escobar and Popeye

602
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,664
Are responsible for the suffering of

603
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,992
And a dad send you know the killing and the terror

604
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,576
Yeah we digest I can Overlook that

605
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,856
You know I can buy

606
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,928
You might be entertaining for a TV show for a movie

607
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
By in real life

608
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,024
These guys are psychopaths

609
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:59,424
So given all the suffering that you've seen and experienced with a conflict between the cartels and the government and

610
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
Fark

611
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
Is the leftist guerrillas who

612
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
Murdered your father

613
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,360
Why did you decide to move back to Columbia after so many years away

614
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:14,272
I decided I decided to go back to Columbia because it was around the same time

615
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
Thus far

616
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,368
And the government

617
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
We're finishing up

618
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,720
Signing their peace agreements

619
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,304
So there isn't a piece of cord that they were finalizing

620
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:32,960
And I went both as a journalist but I also win Colombian Vino victim of the violence

621
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,312
And yeah I just wanted

622
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
2

623
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,968
Maybe come back and he'll both collectively and and you know them personally

624
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,808
And I wanted to be part of that crucial time in our history

625
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,368
Where you know 50 years old

626
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
In over 50 years

627
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,976
Apostolate where you know we're coming to an end

628
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,304
In the longest-running conflict in the world was coming to an end

629
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:04,448
There was a concert that you went to that was a celebration of the signing of the peace Accord and it

630
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,264
Sounds like it was a really significant moment for you

631
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
Can you tell us that story

632
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
So

633
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:14,432
I say this moment you know crystallized for me last year

634
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,528
When I was I went to a concert celebrating the

635
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,856
Define the signing of the peace Accord in in Bogota

636
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,440
And so they had a concert in the main square of the

637
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:29,792
And not the concert we know most of everyone was wearing white

638
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,608
I'm waiting you know why

639
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
White balloons

640
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,936
Elevating me another piece of cord

641
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,240
However

642
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:44,896
I saw other people wearing red shirts and waving red flags and friend I was with

643
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,968
The president told me she might confirm that

644
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,272
The people right wearing the red shirts

645
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
Warning signs fart

646
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
Urban militia numbers

647
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,928
Set a remembers of the fart button thing that would like the bullet

648
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,768
And then you know the concert

649
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,608
The the lead singer from this

650
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,656
Columbian rock band outfits

651
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
Called everyone

652
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,800
To hug a stranger in the name of Peace like to hug somebody you did not come with

653
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
And then

654
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,896
Right next to me was his young man College age

655
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,712
And he was wearing a red shirt

656
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
Approached me

657
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,088
And he was young he was drinking I would have been pay

658
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,624
Which is the Colombian liquor

659
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,976
So you approached me and offered me a swig of his I will get the bottle

660
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,768
And I took a drink of it

661
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
And then he came and gave me a hug

662
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,888
And I. Moments you know I just like when they realize they

663
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
Wild

664
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,192
Miss this person

665
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
Is

666
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,032
Or was part of

667
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
Love the fart

668
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,384
The same group had killed my father

669
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
Bye

670
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:54,784
You don't like it very emotional there were people in tears that were people

671
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,600
You know very moved from happening

672
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,672
And I realized that moment you know like this is

673
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,464
Aspen you peaceful Columbia

674
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,608
That was reported Luis Gallego recording himself on his iPhone

675
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
In Spain

676
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:15,520
This story was produced by Luis Gaya edited by Fernando echeverri and Marlon Bishop

Production help from Sayre Quevedo

679
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:27,296
A program today was a collaboration with latino USA if you don't know them they're great podcast and radio show Within

680
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,344
An inside look at Latino life

681
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
Culture history in politics

682
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:35,232
It's in English and it's not just for Latinos there is something for everyone

683
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,608
We were brand new show in radiotopia it's called the zigzag

684
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:45,728
It's graded by manoush zomorodi and Jen poyant used to work together on WNYC note to self

685
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,288
Agon independent.com podcast

686
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,848
And their own podcast company in their own way

687
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,152
And we're going to follow along in real time

688
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
As they build it

689
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Scratch

690
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:59,296
When they were raising money for their company they looked into investment and grants

691
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:04,160
And found those traditional path unreliable and require them to give up too much control

692
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,976
So they're trying out something completely new

693
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
Here's an extended preview

694
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,704
Early on when we've been talking to everyone we need to figure out like really should we start our own company I am

695
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,824
Met with a friend of a friend who actually advised media startups his name is Josh Benson

696
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,384
And then Josh call me back

697
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
Because the more he thought about it

698
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,736
Since we had our first conversation

699
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,784
The more he thought that actually

700
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,880
Then I would be a great fit for this other start-up he was working with

701
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:39,744
It was kind of hard to explain but the gist of it was that this group of techies and journalists

702
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,280
We're building something

703
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,840
That would throw good journalism a life

704
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,424
Help it survive in a world now driven by

705
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
Free Facebook news feed

706
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,264
They were called civil

707
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,336
And thanks to the generosity of a multi-billionaire

708
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
They had money

709
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,176
Actually had grants to give out to journalist

710
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
Proven track

711
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
No strings attached

712
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,832
The journalists would own their work

713
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,904
All they had to do was contribute to the Civil platform

714
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,488
And the way they were making this media fantasy come true

715
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,816
It was something called the blockchain

716
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,520
Jen and I had heard of the blockchain you may have to

717
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:27,360
We weren't entirely sure how it worked or what it had to do with journalism

718
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,688
And like most people we pretty much

719
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,832
The most popular cryptocurrency that had made the people who bought in early really really rich

720
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
According to memes

721
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,928
Attempt to compel them to buy Lamborghinis

722
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,512
Why the hell would we want anything to do with

723
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,352
Research we started to understand

724
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,192
Black teen was just the technology that made Bitcoin possible

725
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
But it could

726
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
Maybe

727
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,592
Do so much more than just make some dudes Rich enough to buy Lambos

728
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,640
The movie Red

729
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:05,504
The more we felt like actually the blockchain could be a second chance for the internet

730
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:09,088
It's over the last few years we've seen that the promise of the web

731
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,648
Information and access for everyone

732
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,696
It had been totally perverted

733
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
But the blockchain

734
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,792
If it really got off the ground

735
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,352
Could do things like protect people's identity

736
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,424
Help get eat faster to natural disasters

737
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,728
Sustain the poorest population

738
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,544
Maybe even help protect democracy

739
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,104
And save important struggling industry

740
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,176
Like journalism

741
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,224
Either big promises

742
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,344
After hearing what civil was doing with the blockchain

743
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,392
We were kind of stoked

744
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
Josh

745
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952

00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:51,072

Please make yourself

749
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:04,384
Cuz I just think you guys are going to be obviously like a super interesting and attractive proposition to bunch of places

750
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,944
It's like we know some people who are doing interesting things

751
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
Podcasts in French

752
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,784
It's just like we're thinking about all that stuff

753
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,576
Because why the hell not

754
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,856
Weird crazy

755
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,672
Blue Sky opportunity at the moment and so we just

756
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
Once we left the meeting

757
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,328
It was no need to play it cool anymore

758
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:24,864
Jen and I want

759
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
Just give me three words

760
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,056
Right

761
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,128
I mean I'm scared

762
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
They like

763
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,688
It sounds too good to be true but like

764
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,736
It's perfect for us

765
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,296
Can I help with this

766
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
Launching

767
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:50,976

768
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,304
Incivil wanted us

769
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
2

770
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,376
Especially when we told them what we do with the grandpa

771
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,424
Make our first podcast

772
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:06,080
One then actually explained in normal non-hardcore taking language what the hell the blockchain is

773
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,128
Because here's the thing listeners

774
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,432
That Grant civil gave us

775
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,736
It was half real money

776
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,808
In the other half is a new crypto-currency

777
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
But they call Sybil tokens

778
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:24,000
These tokens have no value yet but after they get auctioned off to the public

779
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:28,608
They could be worth quite a lot for nothing at all

780
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:34,752

817

A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

818
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,672
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

819
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,208
That whines through a

820
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,000
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

821
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,536
We're looking the part

822
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,328
Might cost you your life

823
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:40,448
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

824
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,800
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

825
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:49,152
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

826
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:55,808
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff actually if I'm being honest

827
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,136
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing

828
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:05,536
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

829
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,864
Was found dead in my private gym

830
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,192
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

831
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:16,544
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

832
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
Now

833
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,872
I need to clear my name

834
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:25,248
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

835
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
