1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
This is 99% invisible

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,072
I'm Roman Mars

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:08,192
When you're on Highway stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,752
Also do you start to feel the same

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
It's easy to forget

6
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:18,688
That you're in a particular place on the Earth surface Coast Oribe or a desert or playing

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,320
Mexico City is one of the biggest busiest traffic cities in the world

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,624
But it's also a Highland Valley

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,928
Over 7000 feet in the air

10
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,488
Surrounded on all sides by volcanoes

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,072
Sometimes these volcanoes spit up a little fire and smoke

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,656
To remind people of a volatile geology all around them

13
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,216
What about a millennium and a half ago

14
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,520
Volcano called

15
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,056
Fully erupted

16
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:49,408
Molten lava poured into the valley destroying an indigenous City

17
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
And covering 30 square miles in a bed of volcanic Stone today most of the

18
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:01,952
Is lava field has been paved over with roads and buildings parking lots devoured

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,232
Bible artist

20
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,768
City in North America

21
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
Mexico City

22
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,584
The producer Emmett Fitzgerald

23
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,656
But in the midst of all this urban sprawl

24
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,216
There's one spot where you can still get a good look

25
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
That old volcanic

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
So you can see now

27
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Mm

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
19

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
Rocks

30
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
That

31
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,920
Executive team

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,248
1600 years ago

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,832
This is Pedro, Raina is a landscape architect

34
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,672
And we're in the Patriot ghoul they sign on helica logical Reserve

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,488
It's a small Park in South Mexico

36
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
Go City

37
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,048
It contains the Last Remnant

38
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
The old lava field

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,424
Looking down at the ground you can see Swirls and Fulton The Rock

40
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
How the lava was moved

41
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,752
The cooled although Centre

42
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
Teresa go

43
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Yeah oh yeah

44
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
In Spanish. Corazones

45
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,712
In English El Pedregal means the rocky place

46
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,576
And it's a fitting name the ground tears made of purplish black stone

47
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
Covered in bright green lichen

48
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,928
Dry Brown grasses are growing up

49
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,000
Did the cracks but Pedro says that when the seasonal rains come

50
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
This whole Lance

51
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
Will transform

52
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
Theme rainy season

53
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,656
It turns green and a lot of chorus

54
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
Call ranch red

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
Yellow

56
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
Purple blue

57
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,848
A lot of wildflowers so this is

58
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Beautiful

59
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
Pedro Cardenas

60
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,456
Probably the pager dolls number one fan

61
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,992
Kevin De bruyne

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
300

63
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
Of different species of plants

64
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,368
There are two or three

65
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Endemic species

66
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
Only here in this place

67
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
Fine.

68
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
What is an orchid

69
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,304
And the other one is a cactus

70
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
There's also a tiny little frog

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,168
That only appears in the rain scene

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
Bug bite

73
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
But some nights

74
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
Penn Station

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
Listen to scrub the little

76
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,200
Fairy versus Magic

77
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
And many people even me

78
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
Are very crazy about that you like it

79
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,880
Pedro is not the first Arkansas

80
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,904
Pek to fall in love

81
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
With the better gone

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,304
Back in the 1940s this lava field became the Muse of the great Mexican modernist

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
Luis Barragan

84
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,400
Oregon is a giant Mech

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
He's famous for designing

86
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,288
Simple cubic houses painted with full bright color

87
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,592
Yellows and reds fuchsias

88
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
Is vivid

89
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
Single color walls are like the

90
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
Instagram background

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,784
Paragon design some of his most interests

92
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,344
Houses among the rocks of the Patriot golf

93
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,440
But in attempting to build harmoniously with this volcanic landscape

94
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
He may have accidentally

95
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,768
Led to its demise

96
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,864
And contributed to an ecological crisis that threatens the future

97
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
Of the entire city

98
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,128
Luis Barragan move to Mexico City from Guadalajara in the late 1930s

99
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,688
The city was in the middle of a building boom

100
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
And amidst all that construction and growth

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,784
The Patriot all about

102
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
10 miles south of

103
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
The city center

104
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,904
Was one of the few places that remain completely undeveloped

105
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
Paragon used to explore the lava field

106
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
On weekend hikes

107
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
What does artist friend

108
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,839
Barragan like a lot of other

109
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,631
Artistically minded

110
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
People

111
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
Putting Diego Rivera

112
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Became enamored of the

113
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
This place

114
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:33,151
This is Keith egner he is an architectural historian at the University of Oregon who wrote a book about Louis Farrakhan

115
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,271
He says that Barragan fell in love with a paid real for its physical Beauty

116
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,599
But also because the landscape felt distinctly next

117
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,671
It was a place that the Spanish should never change

118
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
I'd never colonised

119
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,559
It was a place with interviews of the volcanoes that

120
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
We're so Central to a lot of

121
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
Mexican mythology next

122
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
In history

123
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,215
American decided to build their

124
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
He came up with the

125
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
Plan of building

126
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,847
Houses modern houses

127
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
Jade Gardens

128
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
On this

129
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
Again very distinct

130
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
Volcanic

131
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
Site

132
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,319
He called the project Los jardines de Pedregal

133
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,927
3 years this uneven Rocky landscape tutored would be Developers

134
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
The Dragon song the lava

135
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
As an asset

136
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
And rather than

137
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:27,423
Breaking up the lava and carting it away and trying so unilevel off the ground as

138
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,239
Other people might have done there are gone

139
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,543
Develop this idea to

140
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,895
Keep much of the lava and the native vegetation place

141
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,807
This idea was inspired by Architects like Frank Lloyd Wright who believed that the design of a building should reflect the landscape

142
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
On which it was built

143
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,463
Justice wright-designed his famous Fallingwater house around the spectacular waterfall in Pennsylvania

144
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,327
Barragan wanted to Design Homes inspired by this Majestic love

145
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:02,495
And so he decided that all houses in The Patriot all should be simple and modern and made from basic local materials

146
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Streets

147
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,079
Should follow the natural Contours of The Rock

148
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,383
And lots should be kept for really large

149
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,431
How much is 30000 square feet

150
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,503
And that house is only take up a relatively small

151
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
Percentage of those

152
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
Lots

153
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623
The rest to be left to Garden

154
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
Barragan was obsessed with garden

155
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
This could be apocryphal but

156
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
Supposedly he used to say

157
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,583
I don't build houses with Gardens

158
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
Idled Gardens

159
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Houses

160
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,263
And he wanted The Gardens of the page a gall to be Odes to this unique volcanic landscape

161
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,615
The substantial portion of the original law that should be left on site and only

162
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,431
Small patches of lawn

163
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Might be used

164
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Distinct

165
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Native

166
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,111
Trees and shrubs were to be left in place and cultivate

167
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,207
American began working in the Pedregal in the late 1940s

168
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,535
His first houses were carefully nestled among the rocks

169
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
And integrated seamlessly

170
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
With the volcanic landscape

171
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,935
The gardens featured little stairways cut into the stone

172
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
That allowed you to move to the space

173
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,287
There's even a spot in one of the houses where he

174
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,847
Huge piece of lava comes through the wall

175
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,639
If all this sounds pretty

176
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Expensive

177
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
Well it was

178
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,015
Barragan's goal was to convince wealthy professionals

179
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
To escape

180
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
The crowded noisy City Center

181
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,879
It's a breath of fresh air and beautiful scenery

182
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
Philosophy

183
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,743
And he hired a photographer named Armando Salas Portugal

184
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
To really capture the vibe

185
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:35,423
Solace Portugal's beautiful photos of well-to-do Mexican families wandering through the Rock Gardens

186
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:40,031
Help sell barragan's lava lifestyle to the Mexico City Elite

187
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,383
You can leave in Paradise very static plays with a lot of lava

188
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,479
Cheaters Pedro, rain again

189
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,319
You came with your Cadillac 57 or your

190
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
Buick

191
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
59

192
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:00,511
You look like a Cary Grant or something like that so many people mix

193
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Yes

194
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,631
We want to leave that way I know it sounds pretty cool to me

195
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
Right

196
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
You living in this

197
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,055
Rugged Wilderness short drive from your downtown office job like a sophisticated cowboy

198
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Instead of a horse

199
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,711
I have money at that time I for sure

200
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Boathouse

201
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,647
You weren't able to visit Mexico City

202
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,743
Armando Salas Portugal photographs are probably the best way to experience

203
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
Paragon Architecture

204
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
And his vision of Harmony

205
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Between building and Landscape

206
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,703
The truth is that Vision never really came to pass in the real world

207
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
In the early 1950s Barragan got bought out

208
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
The project

209
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,127
And soon all his utopian ideas about how the landscape

210
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
Developed

211
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
Went out the window

212
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
What city was growing in

213
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
Breakneck pace

214
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
And here was this source

215
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Cheap land

216
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,135
And so you can see in this aerial photographs El Pedregal in 1950

217
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,183
There's a few houses and Roads

218
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,743
Is there by 1959 the places

219
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Densely packed

220
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Houses in

221
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Very much built up

222
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,143
The house has got bigger and the gardens got smaller

223
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,239
And newcomers to the area didn't seem to share barragan's Rev

224
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Thanks for the love

225
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,823
They covered up the rocks with driveways and Lawn

226
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Jade garden

227
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
It's full of non-native plants

228
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:26,015
And it's easy to think about this story as a kind of Iko architectural Paradise Lost

229
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,343
In part because of the way people talk about Louis Farrakhan

230
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Cheese

231
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,975
I have come down to us in the scene of the architectural hagiography

232
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,303
The in the in the literature as this you know this Mystic Monk

233
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,607
Sort of remote from

234
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
Modern Life in many ways

235
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
And there's certainly truth in that

236
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
But at the same time

237
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
He was also a very

238
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:53,919
Successful businessman even a rather rapacious real estate developer

239
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
Exercise the Paragon

240
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
That paradise

241
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,831
Was always very ephemeral it was never really been

242
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
Meant to last and again I don't think

243
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
Barragan release

244
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
Expected it to last

245
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
Between the 50s and the 80s

246
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
Nearly the entire love

247
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
What field was developed

248
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
Today about a half million people live on top

249
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
The Pentagon

250
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,751
There are fancy neighborhoods in poor ones

251
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,079
Put aside from the Federal Reserve where our story began

252
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,383
The lava rock is basically gone

253
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,455
It would be fair to put that all on the lease paragon

254
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:32,063
But the irony is as much as he genuinely loved that lava landscape

255
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
In a way

256
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,647
He facilitated its demise

257
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
That's project.

258
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,767
Beautiful houses in Kalamazoo

259
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
Date trigger there there

260
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
The urbanization in

261
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
Insouth mix

262
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
And then starts

263
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
Develop

264
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
Urban develop this area

265
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,687
Pedro Camarena thinks that developing a patriot goal was

266
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:04,063
A fatal error not just because the rocks look pretty or we're home to some cool plants and animals

267
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,927
He says that covering up this unique geology contributed to a deeper problem

268
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,975
Ecological crisis

269
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,583
Playing out in Mexico City today a crisis rooted in the cities

270
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,143
Extremely complicated relationship

271
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
With water

272
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
Yelp for Mexico City

273
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,311
The trouble with water is quite complex

274
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
And it all starts

275
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
In the moment that

276
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
Someone decided to build

277
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
A city of

278
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Upon the lake

279
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
This is Loretta Castroville

280
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,391
I'm I'm an architect and urban designer

281
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:45,023
And I do design design for the city and design with water

282
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,839
Castro Rivera says that the valley of Mexico is

283
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
Actually more of a

284
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Beeson

285
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,191
It's a closed Basin it's like a bowl

286
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
Which has no natural water exit

287
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:59,359
So when it rains all the runoff concentrates in the lower areas of the Beijing

288
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
And

289
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
This bowl starts filling up

290
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,271
For centuries the Basin was filled with a series of rainwater leg

291
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
The Aztecs

292
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Built their capital

293
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Tenochtitlan

294
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,903
On an island in the middle of one of those legs

295
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,975
It'll causeways and canals and floating Garden

296
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
It was like the Venice

297
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Spell mesoamerica

298
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,119
But when Spanish conquistadors satenaw tri-bond

299
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,167
They rebuilt the city as if it was

300
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
Just any old city in Spain

301
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
With a centralized grid

302
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,055
So that's when real trouble starts happen

303
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,687
Nearly every year when the seasonal rains came the colonial City would flood

304
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
We're talking serious flooding

305
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,271
After the flood of 1629

306
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Mexico City was under water for

307
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
4 years

308
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
And in that moment

309
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
That the government

310
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
Viceroy decided

311
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
To open the first

312
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
Canal

313
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Deadwood

314
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
Sorry to draining the lake system

315
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
Over the course of the next several centuries

316
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,007
Is Mexico City built an elaborate system of tunnels

317
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,103
Designed to evacuate rainwater out of the Basin and prevent flooding

318
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
Little by little the city

319
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Drain the

320
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
An expanded out

321
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
Open the dry lake bed

322
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,319
But Mexico City also suffers from a second water

323
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,879
One that seems almost paradoxical

324
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,975
Even as it gets inundated every year with rains and floods

325
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
The city

326
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
Is running out

327
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Of water

328
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,679
In the middle of the 20th century Mexico City population

329
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
Bloated

330
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
And all those people needed

331
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
To drink

332
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,847
Seasonal rain could have provided a reliable source of freshwater

333
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,895
The Mexico City had just built a mass

334
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
Subsystem of infrastructure designs

335
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
Specifically to get rid of it

336
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,551
And now with the 23 million inhabitants in the city

337
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
There's not enough

338
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,927
Drinking water to satisfy the necessities of all this

339
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Enormous population

340
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,535
Today many neighborhoods in Mexico City don't have reliable run

341
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Water

342
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,119
And then when the rainy season comes those same neighborhoods

343
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Get far too much water

344
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
All at once

345
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
So we live in this Paradox of

346
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
Irving Plaza

347
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,543
And water scarcity

348
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,615
To solve the scarcity issue the city took to approach

349
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
A pipe water in from far away

350
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
And they pumped it up

351
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
From the uncle

352
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
Blueground

353
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,063
Which in turn created a third problem

354
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,159
In the early twenties of last century

355
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
Some Engineers saw

356
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
Doug D city was sinking

357
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:30,399
This is Manuel perlakuan he's director of The Institute for social research at the national

358
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
Autonomous University of Maine

359
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
Champion buildings

360
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
Science

361
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Fight

362
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
Centimeters per year

363
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
On some of them

364
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
The reason was pretty straightforward

365
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,991
As more and more people took more and more water

366
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
The aquifer every year

367
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,087
The muddy lake bed soil began to crack

368
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
And crumble

369
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
Like a stale cookie

370
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,951
And that's why the city began to

371
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,559
Today Mexico City is pumping water out of the aquifer

372
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
Twice as fast

373
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
Does it can replenish

374
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,191
And the city has song about 30 ft over the past Century

375
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,775
Did you walk around Mexico City today you can see this in the landscape

376
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Crooked

377
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
Skyline sinkholes in places

378
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,895
With the ground is completely uneven

379
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
Mexico City is

380
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Flooded

381
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
Thirsty and sinking

382
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,319
And climate change is only going to make all of it more extreme

383
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
It's an impossibly complicated problem

384
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
With no easy solution

385
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
But with impossibly complicated problems

386
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
You have to start somewhere

387
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,095
And Pedro, Reina thinks that one place worth

388
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,167
Considering is the lava Fields about patriarchal

389
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
Let's take a look

390
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,031
What is the Pedregal I'm going to show you let me show you

391
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
Why this water

392
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Run

393
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
Very very

394
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Angela Bofill

395
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
Pedro is one of several architects

396
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,271
Who have started thinking about ways the city could recharge it

397
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Groundwater aquifer

398
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
In most places we charge just

399
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Isn't possible

400
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,671
The ground beneath the old lake is made

401
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,975
Clay that retains water on the surface

402
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,535
Prevent it from falling Underground

403
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,607
But in a few places around the edges of the old

404
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,679
The landscape is Rocky and permeable

405
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
You think I was probably

406
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
The best the best place

407
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
Because biggest lava fields

408
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
Are the most

409
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
Permeable

410
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Geology

411
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
On Earth

412
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,295
Back in the pager call Ecological Reserve

413
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Camarena bends down

414
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
And points to a piece

415
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
Lava rock

416
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
Take a look there's a lot of

417
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
Hoses a lot of a

418
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
Horse

419
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
Poorest very porous Stone thank you

420
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,839
It looks like one of those pumice stones

421
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
People use in the shower

422
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
To scrape dead

423
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Skin out there

424
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
More less

425
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:47,871
Pedro says that for years when rain fell on the Patriot call the water would easily trickle-down

426
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,407
Through this porous Stone

427
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Into the ark

428
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
Refer below ground

429
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
Can you stink

430
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
Game of big big storm

431
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
Do you think you can find the Lagoon here

432
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Of course not

433
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,975
But the same cannot be said for most places on the old lava field

434
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,047
Because apart from this Ecological Reserve

435
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
Nearly all of the

436
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
Porous volcanic rock is

437
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Gone

438
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
Cover up by layers

439
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
Permeable concrete

440
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
And so when the rains come

441
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
The water just runs off the pavement

442
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
The Source system

443
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,615
Pedro, Reina wants to chat

444
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
The only thing we have to do is

445
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Depave

446
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,015
The araki

447
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
He feels

448
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
We have

449
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
80 square kilometers

450
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Big lava flow

451
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,695
Obviously he's very very

452
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
But weekend

453
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:43,423
Debate did you understand what I mean what he means is get rid of all the unnecessary paid

454
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,751
Plugging up all those volcanic pores

455
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,591
Camarena wants to be paved parking lots and medians

456
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
Create volcanic infiltration Zone

457
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
Square rainwater could flow back

458
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
The aquifer

459
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,575
Can't create an infiltration Zone next to a toxic waste dump

460
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,207
Or you could contaminate the water supply the Pedro wants to carefully peel back the

461
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
Cities concrete skin

462
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,095
Disposal Ava and try to restore the data field

463
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,423
Because the old lava field is still there

464
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
Beneath all the asphalt

465
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,823
If you go to Los hardiness help in Tagalog

466
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Today

467
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
The upscale neighborhood.

468
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
Louis Farrakhan started back in

469
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
The forties

470
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,479
You can catch a glimpse of this burial

471
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,295
Little pieces of lava poking through

472
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,831
Do the grass in the concrete

473
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
For the most part though it looks

474
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,183
Bike other affluent neighborhoods Mexico

475
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
A lot of Lawns with

476
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Sprinklers

477
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,815
So they prefer to put a lot of grass

478
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
And let me tell you

479
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,911
Date spent nowadays they spent a lot of money

480
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
Are in irrigation

481
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,543
Pedro wants to shift how people in Mexico City think about garden

482
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
A while back he was asked

483
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
China Garden to go with

484
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
The public Arts

485
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
It was built in The Patriot golf 40 years earlier

486
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,015
And instead of planning a bunch of flowers

487
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Shrubs

488
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087
Just started digging

489
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,903
So I create that Garden

490
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,487
Only by Excavating digging

491
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,071
Gardening by subtraction Pedro calls this

492
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,911
Landscape archaeology we start with three guys

493
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
Old guys

494
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Digging

495
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,031
Like archaeological site

496
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,591
They start to remove plants

497
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Then

498
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,383
Soil

499
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
Then starts to appear

500
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
The lava field

501
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Beautiful

502
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,319
It's a lot more work than planting tulips

503
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:41,439
But Pedro says that people in The Patriot all can do landscape archaeology on their own property

504
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:47,071
Uncover the lava and build Aragon style dry Rock Gardens that don't require any irrigation

505
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,863
But it's a tough sell

506
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
People want Gardens that look like Versailles

507
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,775
Yes we are very independent emotionally dependent in Europe

508
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
We still

509
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,871
Design Gardens like in France

510
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
I mean

511
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Is ridiculous

512
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
Because we don't have the landscaper

513
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:09,087
France we don't have the weather we don't have the soil is mems very different

514
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,951
Pedro told me that there is one house in Los jardines del Pedregal

515
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,047
Where you can still see a true Mexican lava rock garden

516
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
It's actually one of the first houses built in

517
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,911
Design by Barragan himself

518
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
Back in the forties

519
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,519
The property underwent a lot of changes in the decade since

520
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
But a few years ago

521
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,103
A new owner a man named Cesar Cervantes

522
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,175
Decided to restore the house the way it looked in Barragan

523
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,271
San Pedro convinced him to uncover the original lava rock

524
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
And he did it

525
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
But now

526
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
Everybody told me

527
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
You have to

528
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
See you have to go to

529
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,951
Two sister house

530
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
See what's happen

531
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:54,143
No I I I I asked him and he said come whatever whenever you want

532
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
But I don't have time

533
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
I on the other hand

534
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Have money

535
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,847
I am sister 70s and we are at

536
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
Gossip

537
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:10,527
Cesar grew up in this neighborhood one really wanted to see visible lava in their Garden

538
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
I don't remember even my father

539
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,647
Covering or getting rid of physical lover

540
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
Sabering dress

541
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,464
Or a swimming pool

542
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,120
When Cesar bought this house the previous owners had covered up the original Barragan Rock Garden within

543
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,912
Astro turf putting green

544
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
But

545
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,264
Cesar in a steam started doing a little landscape archaeology

546
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,336
We start removing and removing layers

547
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,408
Where is the grass fake grass and cement

548
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,968
And slowly the original lava field

549
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,808
Began to re-emerge

550
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,880
Back to its original condition extremely

551
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
Breathtaking

552
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,488
It really is

553
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,120
Cesar kindly let me take a tour of his home with a guy named Mariana esqueda

554
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,192
Before we got the garden Mariana showed me the house

555
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
The walls are

556
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
Thick and heavy

557
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
Painted this delightful

558
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:09,408
As she opened the door I was yammering on about something rather and the house

559
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
Kind of took my breath away

560
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,760
The project at The Gardens of picture. Like what

561
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
What's heat right wow

562
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
I just

563
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
Found

564
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:26,304
So quiet

565
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Asylum

566
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,144
Yeah it feels almost like a

567
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,192
Like a church

568
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,264
After showing me around the house

569
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
Mariana let me out back

570
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
The garden

571
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,664
Weed scramble down a rocky path and then suddenly were surrounded

572
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
On all sides

573
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,480
Buy porous black lava

574
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,040
It was unlike any Garden I've ever

575
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,088
More like a nature preserve

576
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
Filled with Nexus

577
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,648
Chicken plants and animals

578
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,672
Slides

579
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,232
Circle lands like cockatoos

580
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
I mean like there's a

581
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:01,120
Girls like lizards Right There and Everywhere

582
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
I feel

583
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
Wild

584
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
Discomfort

585
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
Liquid

586
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
It's really beautiful

587
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,408
Cesar says that when his neighbor's first saw the Rock

588
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
It was cleared

589
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,480
They didn't even know they lived on top of

590
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
Lava fields

591
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,064
Did you want what did you do here did you

592
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,112
Where did you bring this lava from

593
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
Appear here

594
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
But Pedro, Reyna hope

595
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,280
Said if more people see these rocks

596
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,072
Maybe they'll follow suit

597
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,376
Dig up the lava in their own back

598
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:39,520
Rock Gardens in rich neighborhoods are not going to solve the Water Crisis

599
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Not even close

600
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,872
But every bit of lava that gets on cupboard

601
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,920
Is a tiny step in the right direction

602
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
Towards rebalancing the cities relation

603
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
What's groundwater

604
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,592
A huge thank you this week to the Fantastic environmental reporter Zoe schlanger

605
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:20,736
Her great piece in courts about Mexico City's water problems clued us into Pedro Camarena and his work

606
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:25,088
Zoe has been a lot of great choice but water and climate change and other environmental issues

607
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,392
You can find links to more for work on our website

608
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,184
99pi.org

609
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Have the break

610
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:37,376
We'll talk about the bigger picture and what Architects and designers are trying to do to solve Mexico City's water dry

611
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
Between the beats

612
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,312
Bongs and Charter of our devices

613
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
We're immersed

614
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,640
The cluttered World a man-made sound

615
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
If

616
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:54,272
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

617
00:24:54,528 --> 00:25:00,160
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room in a kid is in another room and we're all hearing. Voice

618
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,184
Technology

619
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
You talk to us

620
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
It is a creation of Sonic trash

621
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,328
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

622
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,656
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

623
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704
To make them more human

624
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,800
Turn the living room lights on

625
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Okay

626
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
Dim the living room lights

627
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
50%

628
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Okay

629
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:29,344
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

630
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,648
Makes for a much more natural

631
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Experience

632
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
Turn the living room lights on

633
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,304
Dim the living room lights to 50%

634
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:47,008
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

635
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,800
Landscape is impacting our health

636
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,104
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

637
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,176
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

638
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
Right here

639
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
NPI fate

640
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,600
So I'm back with Emmett in the studio

641
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
To zoom out

642
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,488
And talked a little bit about the bigger picture when it comes to the Mexico City Water Crisis

643
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,096
Yeah and then she talks to Loretta Castro Vergara who's one of the Architects that we eat

644
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,680
Heard from in the story she'll tell you that it's a question of design

645
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,496
Design is really a key element

646
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
In

647
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
In this situation

648
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
For us

649
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
It's

650
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,360
The language with

651
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Speak

652
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
Sweetwater

653
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,712
Oh I like speaking in the language of design

654
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,760
Yeah I know

655
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:36,928
She sounds like a 99ci there's no silver

656
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,488
Bullet design solution for for Mexico

657
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Cities problems

658
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,096
But what she kept coming back to with me was a fundamentally

659
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,168
The city has to change its relationship to rain

660
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,776
Mexico City is different than

661
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:56,896
A lot of other cities that are facing water shortages around the world and if they do get

662
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,992
Brain if it rains it rains that you know Cape Town South Africa would love

663
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,296
To have as much rain as Mexico City does

664
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,112
But because of his history with flooding which

665
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
We heard about

666
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,952
In the piece yeah they've learned that rainwater is

667
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
Is bad

668
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
The problem for us

669
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,792
Seawater as our enemy

670
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,120
We have learned that water that falls

671
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Is a problem

672
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,448
And we've learned that for the last

673
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
700 years

674
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
So it's really hard

675
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
Change

676
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,872
The way in which we see rain water

677
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,664
But they really have to because

678
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,456
That rainwater is an asset

679
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,736
That has been waist

680
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
Stood for so long

681
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
Literally hundreds of years

682
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,648
Focusing on the rainwater out of the valley

683
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,952
Fast as you can so that we don't flat out

684
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:47,840
And you know the consequence of doing that for so long has been like the desiccation of the Watershed

685
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,400
So this is Enrique lomnitz

686
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:57,056
Enrique is the co-founder of an organization called is flower Bona Urban Island in Spanish

687
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
And the whole

688
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,992
Go ladislau Urbana is to try and take advantage of all that rain to try to flip the equation on its head and say let's turn this way

689
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,272
Bring water into an asset

690
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,600
And to do this what they do as they design and in

691
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,648
Install rainwater harvesting

692
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
Systems on people's homes

693
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
And Enrique

694
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:18,304
Says that this makes sense for a couple different reasons one because

695
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,840
It provides people with reliable

696
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
Play clean water

697
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,704
N2 because it reduces the pressure on the groundwater aquifer

698
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:31,616
Rainwater harvesting systems like we used they help you avoid pulling water out of the ground and they help you avoid

699
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,664
Putting water into the sewage system

700
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
And the help of family

701
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,016
In parts of the city that are having big water problems

702
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:43,904
In 2009 in a neighborhood that had particularly bad

703
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Water problem

704
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:51,328
Like people are starting to open their tops and have like brown water come out of the top number or just not have any water coming out of the

705
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
The top sometimes for weeks on end

706
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Apparently

707
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:06,688
What is the weather for a Skype tape

708
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:13,088
But anyway designed assistance for individual homes

709
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,880
Is rainwater from the roof of the house

710
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,904
Filters out

711
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,464
All the kinds of impurities that you might have an in

712
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
Stores IT in a big

713
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,792
Tank for daily use

714
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,584
It's a pretty simple

715
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,704
Design intervention but the thing that makes it the work really challenging is that

716
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,288
You can't just mass-produce this system in and ship it out

717
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,592
Every house is different now so everyone wants these things

718
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,384
System is like a custom install

719
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,712
Every family has to be

720
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:43,296
Trained and taught how to use rainwater harvesting system and

721
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,392
What is for and how to use it and how not to use it and what's be careful of

722
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,464
Cancel the work ends up being really social you know you can't

723
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,744
Drop the technology

724
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
People you have to

725
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,584
It's a cultivate relationships and get them onboard

726
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,632
Cancel can you

727
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,680
Drink the water that clean water

728
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,240
So no it's not clean enough to drink

729
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,776
But it is clean enough for

730
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:09,408
For just about every other household uses could have that makes up the vast majority of the water that home

731
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,688
Music music

732
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,040
And so what is the scale that they're working on how many of these water systems are they

733
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320
Tranny installed around

734
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:22,976
Yeah so at this point they built about 11,000 rainwater harvesting system so it's a lot but it's not

735
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,304
Not a lot in the grand scheme of things and mostly they've been

736
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:31,936
Doing this on a fairly small scale and going kind of neighborhood to Neighborhood very Grassroots approach

737
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:38,592
But things even in the last couple years are really starting to scale-up and then Mexico City just elected in

738
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
You meher

739
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,176
Her name is Claudia sheinbaum and she's

740
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
A scientist who spent

741
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,856
Haha yeah scientists

742
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
Any country really

743
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:57,280
But she spent her whole career studying environmental issues water issues specifically she's got an engineering background

744
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,584
This is all like really up her alley

745
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,424
And since her election you know just this past year

746
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,312
The government the city government has started to work much more closely with this liar bana ends and they really want to push

747
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,360
Rainwater harvesting on a really large

748
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Scale

749
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:18,528
The Mexico City government was like dude this is an important project and we need to do a huge knowing all of the parts of the city that don't have

750
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:24,416
And we're installing we're going to be installing 10000 rainwater harvesting systems there this year

751
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:30,816
And if all goes well financed inflation like a hundred thousand or more rainwater harvesting systems over the next few years

752
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:36,448
So it's definitely a large-scale experiment at this point it's kind of one of its kind in the world

753
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,240
Possibly like scaling up

754
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,920
Threatened

755
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
Harvesting is the solution

756
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
It's really going to take

757
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Home

758
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
Basket of different strategies

759
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,368
To get Mexico City out of this mess

760
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,952
We're going to get out of this situation by doing a whole bunch of things together

761
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,488
But that's fundamentally

762
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
Just create

763
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,072
Balance between how much water

764
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,144
We actually put into the ground and how much water we pull out of

765
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
Basic

766
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,568
And without a Milo Reddick Astro Regatta the architect

767
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:19,968
We are from earlier it's focusing on designing parks and other sorts of public spaces that also function as water in infrastructure

768
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,064
You don't like a public sister and then things like rain for a lot of

769
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
People

770
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:31,232
Or a public park that has an in ground water infiltration component where you've actually got rain water flowing back

771
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
To the aquifer

772
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:38,400
And so her goal is to create a whole network of green infrastructure so that when

773
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
And those rains

774
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,448
Cam the city

775
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,496
Can take that water in and make use of a

776
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,032
Innocent sandwiches

777
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,336
The city could really be, a sponge

778
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,384
So when we have one of these

779
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,664
Rain storms

780
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,736
Oldest public spaces somehow are evil

781
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,016
Who holds Rainwater

782
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
And keep it there

783
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,600
Until the storm

784
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,624
Passes

785
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
On that way

786
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,000
Theoretically a big rainstorm could be something that people are

787
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,072
Looking forward to and then hoping for rather than something that they fear

788
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,352
Because it would

789
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:14,752
Both collect water that they need and also mitigate flooding because the water would be drained to the offer instead of being on the

790
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,800
Surface and trap they're destroying things

791
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:23,200
It's true it's true yeah if you can if you can hold that water you're also preventing at water from turning into dangerous runoff

792
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,248
Does problems you know I mean

793
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,904
You should go to Power that like flooding requires its own you know the in order to solve the flooding problem there's other things that are

794
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,720
Are needed there are Architects that are actually thinking about

795
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,816
No bringing back remnants of the old Lake systems as ways to

796
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,864
Allow water to flood into these

797
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,264
Spaces I can hold and retain water and teeth people say if you know you know there's all kinds of things that

798
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,616
Fashion designers are thinking about their men Engineers to the big problem if it leaks

799
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,664
The whole water system is old and filled with leeks

800
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,456
Some people estimate their losing as much as

801
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:59,040
Is 40% of water and leaks so they let you know in terms of blow

802
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,832
A fruit that's a great place

803
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,624
Start also Wastewater

804
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,024
Wastewater reuse you know there's so many different things that need to happen and Loretta's points basically like we need all of it

805
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,424
Not waiting around to the best solution we need an all of all of the above strategy

806
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
Because what I see

807
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:21,056
At this moment is that we have enough infrastructure

808
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,848
To keep the city safe

809
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,128
For 30 years

810
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
So we can sink

811
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,968
Window of 30 years

812
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,760
We have a very big up

813
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528
Opportunity

814
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,600
Putting up all this alternate Water Management

815
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,624
Strategies right

816
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,928
Then we could really use this 30

817
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,720
Yours for our best benefit

818

25th

819
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,072
Let's have this problem of we have no more water and the City

820
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,864
Disappearance no because we also know

821
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
From history

822
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,936
That many cities disappeared

823
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
Because of lack

824
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
Water right

825
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,056
How to find dollar real

826
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,896
Existential crisis about the existence of an entire city because of water

827
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,688
Absolutely

828
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,248
Young 2022-23 million people

829
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
It's really scary

830
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:03,808
But

831
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:08,928
But you know I mean honestly everyone that I talked to seemed a little more optimistic than

832
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,256
I was expecting and I think that that optimism

833
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,792
Comes from the sense that they

834
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:20,192
The city is really feels like it's undergoing a real shift right now and how it it thinks about water and how it

835
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,984
Deals with water

836
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
Towards

837
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,568
Embracing all the rain that

838
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,592
Flows into the basin

839
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,408
And the question is just like can that shift

840
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
Fasting

841
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,552
Get it right we can we can make another interview

842
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,624
15 years Federal see if it's working or not right

843
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,976
It was Booker right now

844
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
Thanks so much

What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

881
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,728

Adad

I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

884
