I'm Roman Mars

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,208
It is the most reviled form of contemporary architecture

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
There is

33
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
Mcmansion

34
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,608
Is an oversized house usually over 3000 square feet

35
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,656
That doesn't really interact with it

36
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
Environment weather that's the houses around it or if it's built in the middle of nowhere that environment as well

37
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,872
Kate Wagner creator of the blog mcmansion hell

38
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,224
She helps readers like me understand what is and isn't a mcmansion

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
And why we hate them

40
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,088
The main signs of a mcmansion or that they're built

41
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,464
Cheaply with very cheap materials new materials rarely ever traditional materials

42
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,608
As you can tell by the name of the blog and by her General demeanour Kate Wagner

43
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
Hates

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
The mcmansion

45
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:19,520
Their bills without any sort of consideration for the grammar of design

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,128
Since the creation of this show I've used the word architect

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Any boost

48
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
Tenuous

49
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
And metaphorical of ways

50
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
According to Kate

51
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,040
The mcmansion may not even qualify

52
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Fayez architect

53
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
At all

54
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
There's no real architecture

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
And it's too ostentatious

56
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
To be considered full

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,536
They have no architectural,

58
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Commentary

59
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
All they do is

60
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
Represent

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
Should have been ideal

62
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,472
Well it's more an image of wealth rather than wealth itself

63
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,032
It's very much meant to convey that one

64
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
I have a lot of money in a lot of stuff

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
And I am

66
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
Putting it in this house that is

67
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
So tall and so Mass

68
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,272
That you feel intimidated by it just as you should

69
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,576
I feel intimidated by my apparent well

70
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
That's single-purpose

71
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
To convey well

72
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,440
Steamed rolls

73
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,744
Every other potential design principle

74
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
Symmetry or

75
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
Logic

76
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,096
History of beauty

77
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
Guess who cares if you have a big house

78
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
It's like so ugly I don't want to look at it

79
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,496
Kate believes the source of this ugliness

80
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
Stems from the combination of mass production

81
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
In customization

82
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
During the 90s and 2000's thanks

83
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,992
Easy access to a lot of money through Bad Mortgages pushed on the American people

84
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,088
The taste of the new homebuyer ran to the extreme

85
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,904
The standard model Elizabeth mass-produced homes reflected that

86
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:45,280
Blu Grand entrances and granite countertops and stainless steel appliances were nice enough

87
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:50,144
Many new home manufacturers allowed for customizations that brought the opulence

88
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
To the next level

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,008
So the combine the two done already design prototype with

90
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,824
Set up a custom home which can end up

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
In some pretty

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
While looking

93
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Results

94
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,736
So they're designed and customized from the inside out

95
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
And it makes the outside

96
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
Big

97
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
And weird

98
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:13,184
And lumpy cuz somebody wanted cathedral ceilings in their bathroom wish

99
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
Is obviously in this us

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,327
The first victim in the design from the inside out process

101
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Is the roof

102
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
Mcmansion roofs

103
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
RMS

104
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,751
The roof is sort of the number one way to tell

105
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
Mcmansion from a mansion

106
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
And that the roof kind of makes no sense

107
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,687
It's got various pitches which is held certif

108
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,991
Steep the Rufus and it's got

109
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
Many different shapes many different heights

110
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,575
Many different angles

111
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:46,975
Like a gabled roof with a hip roof the pyramidal roof you don't really need to know what these look like but just know

112
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
They're not usually all together

113
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
They're really just

114
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
There

115
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
To put a hat on a ridiculous

116
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
Crafted house

117
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,983
But the coup de Grasse of the mcmansion roof is a future that Kate has dubbed

118
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775
The mcmansion nub

119
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
The mcmansion Novas

120
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,663
Where you'll see like a roofline that is relatively organized and I know just have like this

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
At the top because

122
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
Somebody had to have some fun

123
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
Feature and they just couldn't fit it in

124
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
Linearly usually it's like either storage space or like someone wanted

125
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Some ridiculous

126
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,695
Feature so they just have this like

127
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
At the top

128
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
Just like a hat to a hat if

129
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
If you will

130
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,631
According to Kate another Hallmark of the mcmansion is the two-story entrance

131
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,447
You walk into a house and their son leave the house so much space

132
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
Wow look at our chandelier

133
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Wow

134
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,567
So dramatic that was aware that

135
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Dramatic

136
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,943
They being the real estate brokers in marketers and hoes

137
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
Civ house flipping TV shows

138
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
So to have a big entryway

139
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
You should probably have

140
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
Pretty big door

141
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,743
And then on top of that really big door there's a really big window sometimes there's like three foot of usual space and then the really big one

142
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
The window usually has a

143
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,095
Square bottom to match the top the door

144
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
And an artist

145
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:04,031
Top that kind of window shape didn't even exist really before the mcmansion did mcmansion invented that

146
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,359
Window it's not only the window on top of the door that makes

147
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,175
Caden the Avid readers that mcmansion hell cringe

148
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
It's all the windows

149
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
And I do mean

150
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
All of

151
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
The window

152
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
Is usually more than three different shapes

153
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Windows

154
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Of course

155
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:23,999
There are always thoughtful and interesting violations of any design guideline

156
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,143
Bratayley Kate thinks the house should limit the front facade to two or fewer window shapes

157
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:35,519
On keeping a single-window style across the entirety of a single story

158
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,823
Ridiculous houses in my inbox all the time

159
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:43,967
There's like six different types of Windows from 6 different architectural Styles it sort of

160
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
Garbled communication of source

161
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,599
You can't filter the signal from the noise design-wise

162
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,487
And last but not least you can't have a big ostentatious house

163
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
Without columns

164
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,423
So the columns usually either oversized or undersized sometimes the columns are not columns at all they're just called

165
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Shaped

166
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
Protrusions from the exterior wall

167
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
Basically a column is

168
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
Is created to

169
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Serve balance

170
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
Whatever it is that it's holding up

171
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
That's the point of college

172
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,175
I'm just that they hold things up

173
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
I know a lot of people seem to have not understood

174
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Did that in the last

175
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,415
But they actually are supposed to hold things up and so if you have these really big columns and they're holding up the

176
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,767
Tiniest little pediment or Portico then it looks like

177
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Pretty

178
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,887
But the point is is that you have the really big column so everyone knows that you're rich like a bank that also has

179
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,751
Alright so this kind of snarky criticism is fun at all

180
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
BP fun for me

181
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,639
But there's a larger point to be made about the design of the mcmansion

182
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
According to Kate

183
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
The age of the mcmansion

184
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,991
Saw the shift of the house

185
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,319
I'm a place that we live in potentially for the rest of our lives

186
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
To an asset

187
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
That we are decidedly not supposed to live in Forever

188
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,767
People started designing their houses with the notion of selling them in mine

189
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,583
Realtors would advise I wouldn't buy or do this because

190
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
The house isn't going to sell very well

191
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:10,239
So we sort of device this culture where we thought about selling our houses before we even

192
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Spent one night in them

193
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,639
Kate lays the blame for this mindset at the feet of HGTV

194
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
And similar channels

195
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,295
The excess and Conformity of the mcmansion was reinforced over and over again

196
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,367
On Home Improvement and house flipping TV show

197
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,183
Because the house as object

198
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
Could always be improved

199
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
Atlas early to make it better

200
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
But to make it sell

201
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
Home Improvement channels

202
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,471
Wooden paint the house page and then you would see the sticker in the corner this is all we just

203
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
Add an $800 to the value of this house

204
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
Is there something like that

205
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,871
They would come up with these crazy ways to quantify

206
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
It'd be sort of improvement

207
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,271
Cause people to go into these frenzies and that's why it's so many houses look

208
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
The same is

209
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Because

210
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
This is what was

211
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
Told would make our house worth more

212
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Rather than

213
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,511
What actually does make a house worth more which is structural changes

214
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,071
Improving Energy Efficiency

215
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,655
Green upgrades things like that not like adding

216
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Add certain color paint

217
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
Totally subjective

218
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,871
Older mcmansions built in the early 2000s are not proving to be a very good investment

219
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,431
Smaller houses are appreciating at a much

220
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
Faster rate than larger houses

221
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,551
But after a lull in the market following the housing crisis

222
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:32,159
Builders are finding buyers for huge brand new homes again

223
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
According to CBS News quote

224
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,815
Homes 4000 square feet or larger saw a sharp jump in sales last

225
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
Rising 30%

226
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
The year-earlier

227
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
And quote

228
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,471
It's safe to assume that all the bad design choice

229
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
First

230
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
Rounded McNay

231
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Will continue on

232
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,079
In this new generation

233
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,663
Which is not good news if you enjoy the vibrancy

234
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
Variability

235
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
The built world

236
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,599
Houses of different style sets another thing that gives us

237
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Sense of place

238
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,951
You can tell that you're somewhere else because all the houses are different

239
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
But

240
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,535
Sprawl aesthetic is that it's the same everywhere

241
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,119
And he'll houses in Styles didn't evolve

242
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,655
Through a planning committee

243
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
They evolved

244
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
The combination of popular taste and

245
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,847
Place like that's why you'll see like Pueblo style architecture in the west but you're not going to see it in

246
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Cary North Carolina

247
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:28,735
It's just one of those things that gives you a context of where you are and that the built environment

248
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,295
Has everything to do with place as

249
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
Is the natural environment

250
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,695
Embedded in the pages of mcmansion hell are lessons in

251
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
Consumerism

252
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Materialism

253
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,791
But fundamentally Kate Wagner

254
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
Pics of parties

255
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
These crimes against Arkansas

256
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
Hilarious and

257
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
Excruciating detail

258
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
To teach us the fundamentals of our cat

259
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
You're in a new way

260
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,311
Using humor to educate people about the world around them

261
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
Start of a great way to get people involved in

262
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
History of Greater design community

263
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,271
Most people with a learn about architecture in school as they learn like the Greek orders

264
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,343
Psycho this is the ionic columns yes this

265
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,391
Is the flying buttress everyone Snickers

266
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
And it's really dry

267
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
People like really don't care

268
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,791
I firmly believe that people do care

269
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,119
Even if we don't know why even if we don't know how to articulate it

270
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
We feel the effects

271
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
A bad design

272
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,239
Whether we consciously notice it or not

273
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,543
So now people can say

274
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
Now I know why

275
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
I hate that house

276
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Thank you

277
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,943
Now it's like well actually none of these windows match I hate that

278
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,295
And it's empowering people to have opinions about the built environment

279
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
Which states have mostly been served through like

280
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
Marketing

281
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Materialistic

282
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
The Glens

283
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
Rather than from a design standpoint

284
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,559
And as I've learned with pointing out the bad design of City Flags

285
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,119
Once you get people to notice bad design

286
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
Your annoyance

287
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
Spreads like a virus

288
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
I get a lot of emails like it a lot of messages that say like before I read this blog I didn't give two craps about architecture

289
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,663
And now I start to notice these things on all of

290
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,063
The building's I pass by and that makes me so happy because no other people have to suffer through what I have suffered for years

291
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
Years and years and years

292
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,647
And we will all suffer together

293
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
They're bad houses

294
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Ugly Flags

295
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,791
Indoors that you don't know whether to push or pull

296
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:23,423
Are light switches you never remember which light they go to even though you've lived in the house for 20 freaking years

297
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,543
They're terrible currency ugly passports and I'm Comic Sans

298
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,079
Interpublic bench armrest

299
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
You're bogus expiration dates

300
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
Qunar confusing ballots

301
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
That one we really need to fix

302
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Like soon

303
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,903
99percentinvisible is Katie Mingle

304
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Refused

305
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Sam Greenspan

306
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
Avery Chapman

307
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,791
Emmett Fitzgerald turn Mazza Delaney Hall and me Roman Mars

308
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:56,447
All the music this week was composed by Sean real we are project 91.7 kalw San Francisco and produce

309
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
On radio row

310
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
And beautiful

311
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Downtown

312
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Oakland California

313
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,175
So last week I presented at the Frontiers conference organized by the White House

314
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
President Obama was there and was a very cool event

315
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,063
I volunteered my time and I got myself out there

316
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,647
And is a thank you for my effort the White House organizers gave me

317
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
A presidential challenge coin

318
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,255
As you can imagine very big deal to me

319
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,815
The 99% invisible challenge coins are all gone

320
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:27,167
But for this year for the fundraiser we decided to design new radiotopia challenge coin

321
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,007
Likes to give to all the people who stayed with us as regular donors will last year

322
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
As a token of our appreciation

323
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
Enough of them to new back

324
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Hackers who want to get on board

325
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
Nikki Barr show going strong

326
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,039
Having one of these coins means that you're committed to radiotopia being the home of independent producer driven podcast

327
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
When you challenge me with a coin

328
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,159
That means you're part of the family of people that makes us whole possum

329
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,951
What's the new coins box office

330
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:55,327
I can't wait to get one myself go to radiotopia. FM to become a coin carrying radiotopia

331
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,143
If we add 5000 donations to the rules

332
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Press Box

333
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:03,263
To make Cloud accounting software particular design for independent creative people like me

334
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
Will donate $40,000

335
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Do we need

336
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
YouTube make a channel

337
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
I mean you

338
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
Go to Radio Java.

339
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
Between the beats

340
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,391
Bongs and Charter of our devices

341
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,975
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

342
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
If

343
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:30,399
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

344
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:34,495
All hearing.

345
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
Technology talk to us

346
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
It is a creation of Sonic trash

347
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,407
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

348
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,991
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

349
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
To make them more human

350
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
Turn the living room lights on

351
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Okay

352
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Dim the living room lights to 50

353
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
2%

354
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Okay

355
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:03,679
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

356
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,495
Makes for a much more natural experience

357
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
Turn the living room lights on

358
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Dim the living room lights

359
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
50%

360
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:20,063
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

361
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,879
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

362
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

363
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:30,559
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th right here on the 9th 9 p.m.

364
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
