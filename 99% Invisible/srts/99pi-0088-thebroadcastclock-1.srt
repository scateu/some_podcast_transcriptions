28
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,560
When I'm not making radio I listen to a lot of radio more than

29
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,960
Set a clock for 4:30 please my earbuds are constantly lost in my ears

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,568
So that I can press play and listen to radio at any moment that doesn't require me to talk

31
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,968
Or listen to an actual human being in the real world

32

Julia walking on cement stairs

35
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
Or doing the dishes open or driving the car they are but you're somewhere else too

36
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,520
Create driveway moments

37
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
TM

38
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,824
Story so good

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
That listeners can't leave their car until they're over part of what makes a driveway moment is the end of that moment

40
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
When you realize what time it is

41
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,856
You could have been staring at a clock all along but for a while

42
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
For once

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
It had no power of you

44
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,488
That time Distortion field is one of public radio Secret

45
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
Awesome powers

46
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,816
Which is why it is such a shock

47
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,376
When those of us go from being radio listeners

48
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
Do radio producers

49
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,472
Like me and my friend Julia Barton here

50
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,568
The audience is hearing this it's hard to believe he's not nervous

51
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,688
But this is what radio sounds like on the inside and 32 seconds

52
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
Short of what I'm

53
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,992
Supposed to have

54
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,088
So what I'll do is I'll just take 15 seconds of this song

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,392
And then why would they be 60 Seconds

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
You will

57
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,512
I visited NPR's headquarters in Washington DC

58
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,584
And sat in on the live roll of All Things Considered

59
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
Their Flagship Afternoon News Maga

60
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,192
Show their clocks all over the studios

61
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,984
Big Red digital clock

62
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
Huge round analog clocks

63
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,080
Special software and calculator

64
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
Time calculator

65
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,688
What's 60 + 60 equals 200

66
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
Hi

67
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,952
Bring one of the only two play 15 seconds but you're wrapped up 45 seconds earlier so now I have to pay a long time is it okay

68
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
Yeah I mean

69
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Choice really

70
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
We have enough to Detroit

71
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
I don't think so

72
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,960
Monica is Stevia directs all things considered 4 days a week

73
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,616
To me it's the scariest job in the world is built into the design of a program like all things considered

74
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
It's the show

75
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
The show has a set

76
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
The clock is a template

77
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
From which it almost never varies

78
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
Every show that broadcast

79
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,368
Soar aspires to broadcast in the public radio system

80
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
Has a clock

81
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
Basically it looks like a pi it's round

82
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,024
And sliced and lots of weird ways

83
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,143
Some of the spices are very thin there's 59 seconds fit program opening we call that the billboard

84
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
14 seconds for the funding credits

85
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
Ephedra slices 5 minutes

86
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
For the news

87
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,591
The biggest slices are lettered a b c and d

88
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
And they are the psychic

89
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
That's where the stories and interviews live

90
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
And they have to fit together

91
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
1 minute to close

92
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
I remember I was very

93
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Meteors

94
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
Figure it out

95
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,207
The clock is your master for the two hours the show rolls out

96
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
Everything has to be ready

97
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
Segments can't run long by even a second

98
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
Because most of the local stations are automated

99
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
To cut off the national

100
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
Program where the clock says they can

101
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
These times are called post

102
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
You have to

103
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Nothing

104
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
Can go wrong

105
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,151
Of course things go wrong everyday someone reads too long and interview runs too short

106
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
You might hear the dreaded

107
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
Dead air

108
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
Or someone rushing at the post and listeners can hear the clock

109
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
He who can't be named in public radio

110
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,999
And then the spell is broken when you look at this document

111
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,791
You see something

112
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,863
Very regimented and we talked about how it is very rich

113
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
In terms of

114
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
Things happening

115
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Goal is

116
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
For people not really

117
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
No it's there

118
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
That's great Dixon who also directs all things

119
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Considered

120
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,991
But like Michelle directors he never actually looks at the diagram of

121
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
The program clock

122
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,831
This visual representation was hard for me

123
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
To reference

124
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Have

125
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
I had a piece of pie

126
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327
Why is my cheat sheet

127
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
I brought it into the studio every

128
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,471
And according to Greg Dixon he brought it in much longer than he actually needed it

129
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
Until it was in tatters

130
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,079
What does crib sheets and you will find them everywhere in broadcast

131
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,639
Are Abridged the place where the clock actual

132
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
But you can wake up

133
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,991
Wake us up in the middle of the night and we can be like

134
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,063
59 528 1228

135
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,159
128 like 7:48 we know we can go down

136
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
But the entire hour

137
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,279
Without ever stopping because we know it we know it by heart

138
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
And some

139
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
And of course they had dreams about it

140
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,679
NPR they're called directors dreams

141
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
You lose control

142
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,615
You cannot regain that control and to have lost sense of how much time is left in the segment how much

143
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
How much time is left

144
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
The feast and usually is

145
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
It's like the worst

146
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
Bannock

147
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
And you wake up and yours

148
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
Wedding

149
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,159
You can't believe you just

150
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,719
I've had those where I'm on the board

151
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,815
Announcing the Morning Edition on kalw and the sliders

152
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,143
I don't do anything in the Buns just don't look right

153
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,215
Enter rather than try anything I'm just paralyzed with fear

154
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:10,335
Oh yeah in my dream I'm doing a newscast with no copy and I just have the talk

155
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
And talk and talk and talk

156
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,199
And talk like an idiot until the clock goes

157
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,527
I haven't even seen it down clock in ages

158
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,879
Note podcast there is no time scarcity no interlocking gears

159
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
Of local and National broadcast

160
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
And that changes everything

161
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,327
But we also make a version of the show that fits inside the NPR clock

162
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,631
The c-segment of Morning Edition to be exact

163
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
4 minutes and 30 seconds exactly

164
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
Over by 143

165
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,335
Figure out a way to take all these ideas or at least some

166
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
Fraction of these ideas

167
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Brandon

168
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
Into a show that less than 5 minutes

169
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
Sometimes

170
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,783
That really really sucks

171
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,391
But you'd be surprised how often I actually really like the radio version

172
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,607
The first time I really internalized the difference between doing radio and doing podcast

173
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
When people would tell me

174
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,703
But they wanted my stories tubing longer

175
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,775
In the entire decade of radio I produce

176
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
Tired of this podcast

177
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,943
No editor has ever asked me to go longer and I can vouch for that

178
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,015
You're so mean to me is so mean for 30 soccer

179
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,831
What podcasts have no constraints you can be any length

180
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
The only constraint is the content

181
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:33,279
And people always tell me they wish this podcast was longer but I think the show would suffer if it went on too long

182
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
Until maybe there's a need for a clock

183
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,911
Even if the clock isn't strictly required

184
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
Constraint

185
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Or maybe

186
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,007
Restraint in this case

187
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
Makes for better art

188
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,847
When I started thinking about the broadcast clock

189
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
As a piece of design I wondered

190
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,199
How it all got started in public radio

191
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,039
NPR came together in the late sixties in the early 70s

192
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,575
When Network news with

193
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,135
And those broadcast shows of course

194
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
How to clock

195
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,975
But public radio news wanted to be something

196
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
Because of this guy

197
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,607
I'm Bill Sebring and I was the first director of programming for NPR

198
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
Still simmering

199
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,239
He came up with the whole idea of All Things Considered

200
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,567
Which of course everyone in the business now refers to as a

201
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
In the original mission statement

202
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
Did you see was

203
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Called

204
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
Did he identify with

205
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,087
But you decided that wouldn't be a good name for the show

206
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,951
Right-wing was among the earliest designers of the public radio Sound

207
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,815
That sound included lots of audio and voices from the world outside the studio

208
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,119
It called for a documentary-style approach

209
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
Even the same day news

210
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
For that

211
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,239
Bill designed a very open clock

212
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
We didn't have a lot of breaks

213
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Throughout it

214
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
And it was so

215
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
This frustrated some people because they thought

216
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
They wanted a very fix clock

217
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
There was a clock but it was

218
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Not that

219
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
I believe it was time for a we had

220
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Join

221
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Stations but otherwise

222
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
And

223
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
I think that's

224
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
What are things that made it

225
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,631
Interesting to listen to because it wasn't predict

226
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
That way

227
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
And you let the

228
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
The stories

229
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
Stories were leaving

230
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
I like the

231
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,895
The peace the old ATC clock only had a few slices in a lot of open space

232
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,735
In there one story might be 2 minutes followed by another that was 20 minutes

233
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
It was

234
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,063
Open it was kind of like a podcast

235
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
But it still was saying there

236
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
Not everyone appreciate

237
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:40,255
Did that there was a conference two weeks after ATC rolled out in the station managers just

238
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
Call Bill Sebring today

239
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
Carpet for hits

240
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
Fluffy loose sounding program

241
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:51,263
And it was something else that they really didn't like in this is a digression here but this is a punk ass so we get to have digression

242
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,079
And of course I got this criticism from something about

243
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Women's watch

244
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
All that stuff

245
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
That

246
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,223
On FM women's voices have the high frequencies and

247
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
You should see the meter

248
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Building

249
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Let me go

250
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Just come on

251
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,671
Really they said women's voices were too high for FM

252
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Did some voices

253
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
Peakmeter

254
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
Oh my God

255
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,959
We have Sean build seeming was out of NBR a year-and-a-half later followed

256
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
Began a long process of becoming more subdivide

257
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,639
The women he hired like Linda wertheimer and Susan Sandberg

258
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Are well-known

259
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,503
Semen on to help turn Fresh Air with Terry Gross into a national program

260
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Annie's the

261
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,903
Kind of the patron saint of creative open style public radio including this program right here

262
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
But you know being loose and open

263
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975
Can also be its own form of

264
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
People

265
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
Often mentioned to me. The boy

266
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:52,447
Those were the Halcyon Days of all things considered and I was there no they weren't that's Neal Conan who's done everything

267
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
NPR including until

268
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,591
Recently hosting the two-hour live call-in program Talk of the Nation

269
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
New Conan loves

270
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
The clock for him it's an art form until

271
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,039
Itself

272
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
There's these little things that

273
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:13,183
If you've never done it or impossible if you've done it forever you don't even think about doing them

274
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,511
How long is 5 Seconds

275
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
You can ID 3DS and say goodbye in French

276
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,399
So it's not surprising that would Neal Conan took over Talk of the Nation

277
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
More posts

278
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
Because it turns out you said

279
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Pretty much all you

280
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
Need to say about

281
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
Medical marijuana

282
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
By the 40 in

283
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,967
You still coming to something else unfortunately Neal Conan is doing something else now

284
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,551
NPR recently cancelled Talk of the Nation after 21 years

285
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
And he resigned

286
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,391
Neal Conan says artificial constraints make us better

287
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,463
And I noticed that the person who edits audio story

288
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
We was perspective when we're inside the

289
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
The story just trying to make sense of all a report

290
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
We can't tell what's important anymore

291
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,215
If we don't have any constraints we can make boring and confusing

292
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Wingstop

293
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,567
The constraint doesn't have to be a time limit but at least the clock forces

294
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,591
To have a perm

295
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Perspective

296
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
It says

297
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
Stop right there

298
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,199
And figure out what really matters

299
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,063
Of course the clock and also limit what you say as well have to do in the broadcast version of this piece

300
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,183
We're can create nonsense we Samantha Phil time you didn't expect to fill

301
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,255
So there was a day long ago when Neal Conan

302
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
Was not mad

303
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Picture of the clock

304
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,119
When he first started at NPR in the late 70s

305
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,191
He had to direct this new show called weekend also

306
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
Considered

307
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
I think briefed on the clock

308
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,079
By the event director of weekend All Things Considered Deborah Amos is

309
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
Turn on December 9th as a reporter

310
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
And

311
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
And my question to her was

312
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,247
You mean exactly the time

313
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
And I think we ended that for sure that I produced

314
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
About four minutes earlier I was so terrified

315
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
A blowing the post

316
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,975
So a while ago I went to hear Deborah Amos

317
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,559
And afterwards I asked her if this story was

318
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
True

319
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,703
That Neal Conan ended his first live NPR Show 4 minutes

320
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Early

321
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
And she said they did

322
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:07,615
And that they had to grab the longest film music they could find in the studio

323
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,199
Which was some kind of whale song

324
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:21,183
No super design subdivided format is telling us when the stop the story we're just kind of winging it

325
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
Radio

326
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,559
Are always kind of winging it whether you're in a studio

327
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:31,423
Set like mine where I don't even think I have a clock in this room

328
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
Or you're in the broadcast

329
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
Palace in DC

330
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,079
The clocks everywhere

331
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,127
I know so you have the line

332
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,687
We just hope someone out there is listening

333
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,991
OKC disaster avoided

334
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Yeah she finished

335
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
45 seconds

336
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
Earlier

337
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,135
You're not listening hard enough to hear the clock monster

338
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,695
And Hans the dreams of anyone who's look

339
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
Into its Dark Soul

340
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
Do you have to stand by

341
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
Ready

342
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Open

343
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
The crowd

344
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Ready

345
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
Hedrick

346
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,927
Let me take a Julia but hold Roman open settings and go 99% invisible

347
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
This week by Julia Barton

348
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,863
Sam Greenspan and me Roman Mars we are product of 91.7 local public radio kalw

349
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,703
In the American Institute of Architects in San Francisco

350
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Between the beats

351
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
Bongs and chatter of our devices

352
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,151
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

353
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
If

354
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,575
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

355
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,671
Another word for all hearing that voice

356
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
Technology talk to us

357
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,511
It is a creation of Sonic trap

358
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,583
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

359
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,167
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

360
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
To make them more human

361
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
Turn the living room lights on

362
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Okay

363
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
Dim the living room lights to 50%

364
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
Okay

365
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:25,599
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

366
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
