00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984

76
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264

00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
I'm the manager vest

79
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Look for the

00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
San Francisco

81
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
The new SF Park project uses sensors and network meters to dynamically adjust parking prices

82
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Overtime

83
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
The key ingredient is the sensor

84
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
Which sends back data about whether or not a car is a

85
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,488
Be there for the first time we're going to know what's happening on the street

86
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,560
And with that sensor data the parking authority starts adjusting

87
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,888
The sensor to give real-time data back to headquarters and the

88
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,448
New pricing is calibrated for the next month

89
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,752
It's demand responsive pricing

90
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,312
Different times of the day may go up in price

91
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
And meters in

92
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,872
Less traffic neighborhoods

93
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,944
May go down to entice people to park there

94
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,224
And walk a little farther

95
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
But this isn't just about

96
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
Parking

97
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,856
Sfpark is about making a better design

98
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
City

99
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
Lots of cities these days

100
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
Are interested in

101
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
Reducing Greenhouse

102
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Gas emissions factor

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
This is the first time that

104
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
Any city has tested out

105
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Parking base

106
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Approach to congestion

107
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
That's good for people who drive but its

108
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Really important

109
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
For people who are on the bus and just trying to get home

110
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
That the bus is much Bass

111
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,687
The goal is to have constant parking availability One open space for every block so that people get in a space

112
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
Faster in art circling the block

113
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,295
And their toxins viewing death machine

114
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
And it's not just Street

115
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,439
Pricing in the city on garages will also be dynamically adjusted to

116
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
There's no relation

117
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
Between the price of Park

118
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
Parking on street at meters

119
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
And parking lot

120
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
In fact

121
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,143
It's usually more expensive to park in a parking lot of garage

122
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,959
Rather than at the meter and that's just the opposite of how much

123
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
The plan is changed that relation

124
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
You should make it cheaper to park in the lots and garages

125
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
Attract more people just go straight

126
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
To those lots

127
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Keeping this on

128
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Free spaces available for those

129
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
Really value

130
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:14,879
I think it's beginning was press about sfpark is all the data about parking availability that will be accessible by the public and

131
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,023
In the image of some tech-savvy Superuser who is constantly checking their iPhone to find a parking space instead of

132
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
Watching where they're driving

133
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
Which if you picture for a second

134
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Terrifying and

135
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,935
Create more problems than it solves

136
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
But I think this is the wrong image

137
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
If successful

138
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,847
It is a big F in the market sets the right value for a parking space

139
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
You will never

140
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
Look for parking with your iPhone because

141
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
Again the goal is one open space for Block meaning

142
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
There'll always

143
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
C parking available

144
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
There is no search

145
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,695
The things you use your iPhone 4 is finding out how much will cost before you leave the house

146
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
Where you can decide then if it's better to walk

147
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
How to ride the bus

148
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Set of Drive

149
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
The key is that you don't have to know anything

150
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Have an easier time Park

151
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,935

That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

167
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,879
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

168
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,207
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

171

Actually if I'm being honest

172
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
I'm one of the main guys who know how to do that guy

173

A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an act

Movie called Immortal cop

175
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,943
Was found dead in my private gym

176
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,343
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had some

177
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
Nothing to do with it now

178
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
I need to clear my name

179
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:32,095
