Heinrich Boll and the Transamerica Pyramid

00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
Get along

35
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
And the same

Construction

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,616
Building should make sense

39
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,712
There's nothing about this building to make sense or sort of a silly

40
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,760
Design dunce cap we thought

41
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,552
Pyramid shape was

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,832
Nothing but

43
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
Hey

44
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
Let's call it advertising simple the top third of it

45
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208

San Francisco Chronicle Urban Design Rider John King summarized

00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Several

Pyramid

61
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
Does Kobe know that's right

62
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
Inhuman creation

63
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
Chanclas World's Fair

64
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,256
Space Needle assemblyman John Burton said the pyramid would rape

65
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
The skyline

66
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
It seemed to violate the

67
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,288
The whole purpose of zoning in Irvine

68
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
Buildings were no more than

69
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
This was Def

70
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Division

71
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,944
Of that neighborhood

72
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
But over the course of 40 years

73
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
Something happen

74
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,136
Some people have never lost their hatred for the TransAmerica

75
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Repairman

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,768
But other is like Heinrich balm and the AIA San Francisco who recently voted at 1

77
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
Top commercial buildings in the city

78
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,608
I've done a complete 180

79
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
And it all seems

80
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
Depend

81
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
From where you're standing

82
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
You could almost say

83
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
The further you get away from it the better it looks

84
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,128
And be certain nasty it's only a little nasty

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
And funny

86
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Entry when the building

87
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,480
Was completed

88
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
Many of us

89
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
Who had a post

90
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
Realize that

91
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
Surfing need building on the skyline

92
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
Especially as a silhouette

93
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
The sun's going down

94
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
It's really quite right

95
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,815
The taller building since

96
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Really

97
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Pretty dull

98
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
And this

99
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
I know it wasn't dumb

100
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
I don't remember

101
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Any discussion

102
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
Have

103
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
What is going to look like

104
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
Looking out

105
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
Columbus Avenue

106
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,175
Columbus Avenue is it diagnosed read

107
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
And

108
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
Abroad

109
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
TransAmerica building is right at the end

110
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
I don't know if you know the term

111
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
Vanishing point

112
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
Active

113
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
Everything

114
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,463
Goten diagnose 2A

115
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Quite

116
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
And in a way

117
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
You tilt that vanishing point

118
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
Up vertically

119
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
And there's the TransAmerica building

120
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,215
It just is a big surprise

121
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
And had that been

122
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
Conventional

123
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
Modern building

124
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
Of the time

125
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
It would have been

126
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
Tragedy really

127
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,991
Say it's one of my favorite buildings

128
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,599
Not close up how it meets the ground I don't think

129
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,463
Never really got solved the triangle shapes in the columns are awkward

130
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
And if you look up at the building from Below

131
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,327
The spacing of the windows has to be

132
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,143
Pretty weird to accommodate that pyramid shape

133
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:30,751
Still a complete 180 I think that's really impressive

134
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Strength of character

135
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:38,431
I had that same conversation with John King that's the affirmation San Francisco Chronicle architecture

136
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
Ridiculous article on this View

137
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
Really, really was quite surprised but I said that we didn't understand the problem and we were wrong and they said

138
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
Flashlight don't think I remember

139
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
And I say that before

140

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

144
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,943
Series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

145
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
The body genius is a dark

146
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Comic mystery

147
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,087
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

148
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
We're looking the part

149
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
Might cost you your life

150
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,535
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

151
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,887
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

152
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,215
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

153
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
Adad

154
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,591
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

155
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,943
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main got to know how to do that kind

156
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,343
I think a few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action

157
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
A movie called Immortal cop

158
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:57,023
Was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

159
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Even worse

160
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,655
The cops think that I had something to do with it now

161
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
I need to clear my name

162
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:11,103
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
