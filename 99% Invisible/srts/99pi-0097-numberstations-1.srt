Radio radio meaning

24
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,512
You do not see the picture to hear the fun

25
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,584
Hear something called

32
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
Has been good to me

33
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,472
But there's something about the transmission of radio signals

34
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
But I love

35
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:25,408
For billions of years the electromagnetic spectrum was populated only by radiation from natural objects

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
And then

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,832
All the sudden the air was filled with voices and codes and dots and dashes

38
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
And music

39
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:40,512
My Romance radio began decades ago but one of the key stories that captured my imagination at the very big

40
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,304
Beginning of my radio career

41
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,120
With the shortwave numbers mystery

42
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,728
Produced by David corn in the kitchen sisters lost and found sound Siri

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,568
It's one of my favorite stories about when my favorite subjects of all time

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
Coming to Fayetteville

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,688
Detroit numbers mystery was first broadcast in May of 2000

46
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480

49
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,376
The first time I heard a Spanish numbers lady

50
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
Lying in bed

51
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,240
Tuning around in my uncle's old shortwave radio

52
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,592
I was baffled by the solitary voice

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
She's still on the air

54
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,712
Even though I've heard her in one form or another since the early 70s

55
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,272
The sound of her voice continues to haunt me

56
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
Kabul

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792

Fox 13

59
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,008
Number station

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
When I first heard them

61
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Amber

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
And then what

63
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Skip

64
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,992
At the end of the 70s they acquired a following

65
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:10,368
Buffalo hardcore group of listeners continue to obsessively tape and analyze the station

66
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
Think of them Kathy nicknames like

67
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Birdman

68
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512

70
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,119
You statement tracks the numbers for monitoring time

71
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:26,751
Eternal for hardcore radio listeners encrypted messages to somebody

72
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,359
I think it's despise being hope it's just a spies nothing more Sinister than that

73
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:40,319
The number station is defined as any of several hundred shortwave radio broadcasters

74
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,367
All of it you're using

75
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
Hightower big transmitters large antennas

76
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
Global coverage of the entire planet

77
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
Which do nothing

78
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
Sep broadcast

79
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
Meaningless strings of numbers

80
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:58,751
I never say why they're doing it they never say who they are

81
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:03,871
My take on the numbers Transmissions is the doctor the evil twin of a standard shortwave station

82
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,831
Stephen answers and programming of A Sort they even here to Advantage shortwave tradition

83
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:19,231
The interval signal this is a little ditty played a few minutes before the main broadcast to help the listener find and fine

84
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:25,631
Fine tune the signal next contact

85
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:37,151
Wicked meaning through the messages for it could mean there isn't any message has followed usually

86
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Play something

87
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
Let's people know the header is over

88
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:46,367
The CIA likes to be other stations do other strange things

89
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,743
Then they usually go into the message

90
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
Which is a series of numbered group

91
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,607
Four or five numbers

92
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,263
I'm auditioning myself as a lonely agency in the basement

93
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,615
It's an urban area I have no friends I'm far from home for my family

94
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
Is my communication

95
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
This is my link back to my world

96
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
So I'm

97
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
Very carefully recording this message

98
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
I say again

99
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,927
I asked which Nia Ali arcademic photographer

100
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:25,535
Wine intelligence agency would communicate with an agent in the field in such an open way

101
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
Seems to be a relic of the Cold War

102
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,143
We always think of the radio is mass broadcast

103
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
You speak on the radio and everybody listen

104
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,007
This is an example of radio being used

105
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
One particular person

106
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Decrypt a message

107
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
Which allows you to use this

108
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,455
Public broadcast medium to send a private message

109
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:50,367
That's really very pretty

110
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:56,511
The CIA does it Russia does a Cuba does it the British do it everybody does it Hue Stegman

111
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,607
Okay evidence that's a problem there's never anything that hard

112
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
I've always assumed these are using a one-time Pandora.

113
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Which are

114
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:11,871
Theoretically unbreakable given the assumptions of only having ciphertext are only having what's broadcast on the station

115
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,687
A one-time pad is a page of random numbers

116
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,015
Which is the key used to encrypt and then decrypt the message

117
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
The sender and recipient each have a copy

118
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
Padgett's used once

119
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Dentistry

120
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,463
What is pretty much untraceable

121
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,791
The operations have been compromised over and over again

122
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,887
People are captured people change sides people just get sloppy

123
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,727
Many many times they've seen the code pad they seen the receivers

124
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
The fact that the other side knows

125
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,615
But this is how they do it does not give them any more access to the information

126
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
It's a perfect system in that respect

127
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
Sub Station II Jam

128
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,367
Presumably by Rivals who pinpointed the transmitter site using sophisticated techniques

129
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:01,279
A number sentence got to rely on intensive listening to pick up any clues

130
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:07,679
What's up what you hear in the womb

131
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Skates

132
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
Does come from Cuba

133
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,567
The Cuban stop started right after Castro got in

134
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
And start getting tensions in that area

135
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,919
It has gone on since

136
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:22,015
The engineering is sloppy tape stop in the middle of tapes are played backwards

137
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,063
Play radio Havana by mistake

138
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,367
Video Havana place them by mistake

139
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,951
Get the idea they're just barely on top of the situation but they keep that it

140
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,351
There's another Spanish numbers lady who is widely heard in North America

141
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:42,751
Some numbers monitors claim to trace the signal to a government transmitter site in Warrenton Virginia

142
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
They call her Cynthia

143
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
Evan starts with a C

144
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
Ends with IA

145
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
Havana Moon just came out of nowhere

146
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,247
He just started writing one day about the shortwave numbers

147
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
And the stuff was it

148
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
Extremely provocative

149
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
And it seemed to come from

150
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
Read inside

151
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,719
The only thing he would ever say about himself was that he was a retired intelligence type

152
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
Real trench coat Cloak and Dagger spook

153
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,031
Havana Moon was a gentleman named William godbey

154
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,591
He was a retired

155
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
Navel

156
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,943
Personnel and he was just a very nice gentleman

157
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,503
Havana Moon who died in 1996

158
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
Found a co-conspirator in John Sulphur

159
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,647
Ex police intelligence officer with an interest in radios Darkside

160
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
Turn the late 1980s

161
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
They runs around Florida with the radio director

162
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,167
He confided in me that he suspected there was one possibly two transmitter sites in South Florida

163
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,263
He had an idea where couple of them were we took some equipment out

164
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
I set the direction finder up

165
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
We took some bearings over

166
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Couple weeks

167
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,479
With a very lines crossed was right around a military transmitter site

168
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,551
Located one of the airports in South Florida

169
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:06,719
We drove right to the airport when the transmitters came on the radio that we jumped out of our hands

170
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
Right there we have

171
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,375
During the day the Navy sent standard traffic over this transmitter

172
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,935
Located at West Palm Beach International Airport

173
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
Frequency

174
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,519
3 kilohertz away from the numbers transferred

175
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,591
Dantanna's were being down into the Caribbean

176
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
Who sent the traffic

177
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,943
What have no idea it is an unmanned site

178
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,783
Sent over a telephone line from Parts Unknown I would have no idea

179
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
Obviously one of the intelligence agency

180
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
My name is

181
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:41,535
John R Winston I'm the assistant bureau chief of the enforcement Bureau Federal

182
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
Medications Commission

183
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
We don't intend to discuss

184
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Station

185
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,215
If any exist at all and I'm not saying there are

186
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,775
If you're trying to say there are those

187
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
That are transmitted

188
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
In this country

189
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,407
We know of innumerable ones outside of

190
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
Our only

191
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:07,647
Is if they are causing interference we then work with the

192
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
Country of transmission

193
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,231
To seek solution

194
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
We can hide a transmitter

195
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,351
Cryptographer Bruce schneier

196
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,399
Can't remember what number station is doing

197
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,703
Hiding location of the recipient

198
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,775
Location of a transmitter is not necessarily a secret

199
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,823
Person who is receiving it

200
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
Is somewhere

201
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
And we don't know where

202
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,223
Every night in the week in Europe you could hear these

203
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,039
Weird gong sound like some

204
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Church bells

205
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Chill

206
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
Bealls Palestine station

207
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,975
Simon Mason discovered the numbers in much the same way I do

208
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Are the mid-eighties

209
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,839
She began to seriously document that European number scene

210
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,399
From his home in Kingston upon Hull in England

211
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,727
Does being a spy uncovered in bathroom City

212
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
And I know what he was listening to

213
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,335
When he was under the control of the Stars

214
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
East German secret police

215
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,967
The God knows what his wife and kids salt when Eddie's dogs cannot eat it

216
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
5 months after the Berlin Wall fell

217
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,183
Tom station went off the air forever

218
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:18,047
Biological of the big players in the Cold War theory of gone now

219
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,607
A lot of activity now in the Far East

220
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:27,519
The strangest one of the lot is got to be the one to Taiwan writer Hughes pregnant it's called new star

221
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,407
Start broadcasting and it has this lady who they tell me even in that culture is way way too enthusiastic

222
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,247
And she's been computerized comes out of the machine

223
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,623
He says things like good morning

224
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
Please decode your message

225
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
This is all the Mandarin of cars

226
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
She says things like

227
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,071
Thank you very much for decoding today's message

228
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,863
I hope you have a nice day

229
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
I mean

230
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,447
She's being nice to the spies you got to love it

231
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,495
Devastation is so over-the-top

232
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,335
It's take me to think that the purposes left for transmitting secret messages

233
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
Thanks for spreading disinformation

234
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,991
This is colossal diversion so that the mainland Chinese will think the Taiwan is put

235
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,807
Hundreds and hundreds of Agents into that country

236
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
She might or might not have done

237
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,183
I would say that's maybe why happens if you say you do it this way

238
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,559
It makes two guys in a government office and some crummy Building without water somewhere

239
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,911
Sounds like you know they're on the level with the CIA everybody sounds the same on shortwave

240
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:32,799
Bus monitor seemed sure that the number stations are part of international espionage

241
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
But some signals remain elusive

242
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
There are few strange stations almost at MIT

243
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,527
Like the buzz around 462 V pill High

244
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
Maybe he's just keeping his frequency open in case some solve well disaster happens and then they can take over that just December

245
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
Call Shockwave set up after all lights

246
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
Satellites of being blown out of the sky

247
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,823
Just like a notepad and paper left behind in case your computer faster

248
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
I think it's just not biggest conceptual art project unintentionally or otherwise

249
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,087
Anybody ever made it put Crystal in those guys to shame

250
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Panatieri's

251
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,743
I listen to shortwave these days with a bit of a pan

252
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
It's fading out

253
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,095
Regarded as archaic by many International

254
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
Get the number stations persist

255
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:37,311
Sometimes when I hear one I write down some of the groups and wonder who the message is for and what it might say

256
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
Meet your contact

257
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Blow up the bridge

258
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Don't blow up the bridge

259
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
Maybe it's just

260
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Keep list

261
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,343
Atencion seis siete Tracy at Estero the shortwave numbers mystery was produced by David goren

It was produced for the kitchen sisters lost and found sound project on NPR in the year 2000

271
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,151
I caught up with David gura in in 2013 and asked him about what was going on with the numbers stations today

272
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
They're still there

273
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:51,295
They're still on the air by still like to go out there and hunt around and unbearably

274
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,855
You can stumble across the station

275
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
What's changed

276
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
Is

277
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,743
The countries involved the action has moved

278
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:04,351
To the East China Russia North Korea Cuba keeps

279
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,679
Going onto and then away the sort of a mirror

280
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
What's happening on shortwave

281
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,007
In general with

282
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
Countries no longer using

283
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
Shortwave is a means of

284
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,175
Communicating their message are propaganda to other countries

285
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:23,039
So it's still being used and that's just kind of comforting and also kind of creepy she

286
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,855
Cuz when I tune across them you know it's like

287
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:30,719
The world tilts a little bit it was very odd thing to encounter

288
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:38,399
David Byrne current project is called shortwave ology which I highly recommend you can find it online at Short waveology. Net

289
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,703
And also put it on Facebook and SoundCloud

My name is Erica Everhart and I'm the creator of the site you are listening to Lost

303
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:37,023
And you were listening to Chicago you were listening to New York you were listening to Montreal

304
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
And you are listening to San Francisco

305
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
Vehicle that has no bleeding or color the party last year after

306
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
The Giants won the World Series

307
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,527
I was out in the streets of San Francisco checking out all the different celebrations going on

308
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,063
And when I got home

309
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,135
I was looking on Twitter I saw a lot of people are posting links to

310
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,207
What's happening in their neighborhood people out

311
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,047
Lighting bonfires and one thing that kept coming up was

312
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,375
Hey check out the San Francisco police radio on

313
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
Soma FM

314
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
So I started listening to it

315
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:21,823
It was cool and got bored after a couple minutes and started putting on some of my music in the background

316
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,639
And something about that there was like a Synergy between

317
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,455
The police scanner and like the music I was playing

318
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,527
That really sounded cool I want to find a way to share that with

319
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Oh that's right

320
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,671
And since it came online on March 6 2011

321
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:41,279
I've spent what might be considered an inordinate amount of time listening to

322
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,815
You are listening to

323
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
Some people think it's

324
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Peaceful

325
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Some people think it's

326
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
Creepy I think it's mesmerizing

327
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,983
And its Elegance is in its simplicity

328
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:56,383
Show me load the page there's a little JavaScript file that pulls in an audio stream from radioreference.com they provide the

329
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
Police radio on

330
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,063
A playlist from SoundCloud which is music sharing site which has been screened by Everhart so that the play with only has these

331
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,463
Dreamy ambient soundscapes that complement the police scanner audio and also loads the background images

332
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,279
Coming from Flickr those are three main parts and they're all

333
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:18,399
Coming from site other than mayo and only possible because

334
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
Of the companies provide simple web API application programming interface

335
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
Kind of sharing and National

336
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,175
You can create something new that might not be what the Creator intended

337
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,759
The design toys being made by these sites.

338
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
Thing that you are listening to is exploiting

339
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
Is a relinquishing

340
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:42,719
A little bit of a control of their data in order of that data to spread across the web

341
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,279
In ways that they never could have imagined

342
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,863
In this way outside and independent developers like Everhart

343
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,399
Can act as a kind of

344
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
R&D Department

345
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,519
Radio reference and Flicker and SoundCloud and the artist

346
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,919
Is offering Creative Commons royalty free music on SoundCloud did not imagine this use of their content but they do

347
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Do you have an API

348
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:07,551
They just created a shareable architecture that Taps into a remix and culture

349
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,343
Where new ideas can flourish

350
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
Synthesized launched and

351
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,207
It word gets around it's been very popular

352
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,511
I've been contacted by lots and lots of artists

353
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,863
And they all want to be part of it they all think it's cool

354
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,935
And they're asking me can I have my music included on your site

355
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,543
And now they're not getting anything out of it they're not getting paid there's no royalties there's nothing like that

356
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,847
But they are getting exposure I think these are people who

357
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,663
Posted their music out there because they wanted to share it with people

358
