00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,328
This is 99% invisible

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm Roman Mars

21
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,544
Ivy Myers grew up in Brooklyn and married a guy she'd known since they were kids

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,872
Their first son David was born in 1968

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
By the time David was to

24
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,480
I be noticed something was different about him

25
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,528
David's face with twitch

26
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,088
He sometimes made involuntary noises

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
His arms flailed around out of control

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
So he can barely feed himself

29
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,512
He was very disturbed

30
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:41,120
By the other kids would make fun of him

31
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,704
David's teachers often got upset with him in class

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,008
So you can imagine the

33
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,568
Torture that he went through

34
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128
One Sunday morning David with eight

35
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,688
Abby Watkin try to read the funnies

36
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
But he couldn't keep his head steady enough

37
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
That's producer Dan Weisman

38
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,624
Host of a new podcast about the cost of healthcare

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Called an arm and a leg

40
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,000
Watching David struggle with the comics Abby was ready to cry

41
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
She put off doing the dishes

42
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,864
Sat down and picked up another section of the paper

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
End

44
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,168
2 total coincidence

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,240
It was an article about a teenager who had symptoms

46
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
Just like David's

47
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
Facial tics

48
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
Weird noises

49
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Flaming Lips

50
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,456
I stood up and I yelled for my husband and I said you have to read this

51
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,248
This is what David has

52
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,832
Abby and her husband brought the article to David's pediatrician

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
And the doctor agreed

54
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,952
This story described exactly what David had

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,512
This condition will sound familiar to you but

56
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,560
Time most people even doctors

57
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
I've never heard of it

58
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
It was called

59
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
Tourette syndrome

60
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
Speaking to doctors many doctors after that

61
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,800
They said they never heard of it because they simply

62
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,616
We're not talk very much about Reggie season

63
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
The medical school

64
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Back then

65
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
When so few people heard of

66
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,760
Direct was considered a super rare

67
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
It just seemed bizarre to me that I got a diagnosis out of a Sunday newspaper

68
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,952
From there a b sound a special

69
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,792
Eventually turned her on to a potential treatment for Tourette syndrome

70
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
It was being tested out

71
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
Clinical trials

72
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
Well

73
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
It wasn't being tested for Tourette's

74
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,240
The drug company was mainly hoping to Market this drug

75
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
Schizophrenia

76
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,848
The particular drug had been made available in Europe

77
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,896
For a while and taxes

78
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
New it worked on Tourette's

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,552
So David got in on a trial for this drug with the hopes that it could be approved in the US

80
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
It turned out

81
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
It works really well for him

82
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
But

83
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,184
The drug trial

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,488
Didn't go as well for schizophrenia

85
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,376
Which was supposed to be its more common use so the drug company decided the market wasn't big

86
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,936
They just drop the drug entirely

87
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,496
It's so good company she'll suck no

88
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
They wouldn't do it

89
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
They wouldn't make the truck they wouldn't sell it

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,432
And this is how Abby learn to term that would define the next few Decades of her life

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
Orphan drugs

92
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
Orphan

93
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Drugs

94
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
As Abby learned

95
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,672
Drug companies weren't interested in developing treatments for rare conditions

96
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,744
Because the big money was in drugs with tons of customers

97
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
Antibiotics

98
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
Drugs for stuff like diabetes high cholesterol

99
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,423
They just didn't think selling a drug for Tourette's would be a big moneymaker

100
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,263
So promising treatments like the one that have been working for David

101
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,055
Became orphan drugs

102
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,127
With no Pharma company to raise them

103
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
To keep yourself from going nuts with frustration

104
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,271
Abby Meyers joined at the Tourette Syndrome Association

105
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
It's pretty small

106
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,367
Immediately invited her to join the board

107
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
And

108
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
Ask her what you wanted to be in charge of

109
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
I sure did that want to become the fundraiser or the arranger of special dinners or anything

110
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Do you like that

111
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,447
And I wasn't the doctor so I didn't want to do the research end of it

112
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
That left Lobby

113
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
And advocacy

114
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
Spreading awareness

115
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
Abby started figuring out how to do that

116
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
She found a mentor

117
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
Her name with Margery got

118
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,503
Marjorie was the Widow of Woody Guthrie

119
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,599
The iconic American folk singer who wrote the song This Land Is Your Land

120
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,903
Woody had died in the 1960s

121
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
Huntington

122
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
Another rare disease

123
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,255
She was on a mission

124
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,791
Pharrell life

125
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
Which was

126
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
True

127
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,655
Find the answers for Huntington's disease

128
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
Marjorie was

129
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
React

130
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,007
By the time a d Myers started lobbying

131
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,079
Everybody connected with rare diseases new Margery got

132
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
Marjorie

133
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,967
Marjorie would be talking with Scientists or Pharma exec

134
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,015
And they be using technical jargon

135
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,087
She say please talk to me in plain English

136
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
I'm just a house

137
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,159
And they would

138
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,303
And when experts couldn't hide behind technical jargon Marjorie Guthrie would pin them down put them on the record

139
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
And use their words as ammunition

140
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Branson

141
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,215
Experts to explain exactly how promising a proposed drug might be

142
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Why they would sell it

143
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
And all of that

144
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,359
Would be in there and you're in plain English

145
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,431
So when Abby started meeting with government officials

146
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
She introduced herself the same way

147
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Just a housewife

148
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
She figured it wouldn't be a bad thing to let them

149
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
Underestimate her a little

150
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,159
I found the people

151
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
Boys22

152
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,815
Think about a woman as somebody's just trying to raise her kids

153
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
She's just a housewife

154
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
By June 1980

155
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,471
Abby and Marjorie and their allies

156
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,823
Got a California Congressman to hold a hearing to call attention to the problem

157
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
Orphan drugs

158
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,943
This was their big chance to finally have a national audience

159
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
Different Pharma companies on the spot

160
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,319
To make them face the patients who were waiting for

161
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
Maybe this hearing could really changed

162
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Well

163
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,743
Nobody from the pharmaceutical industry showed up

164
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
Also

165
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
Hardly any elected representatives showed up

166
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,631
Well no Republicans at all showed up

167
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:08,031
Maybe one or two congressmen stuck their head in and sat down for 5 minutes and then left

168
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,079
The gallery was pretty empty to

169
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,895
It was like nobody was there except

170
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,479
The very very last row in the room

171
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
A young man was sitting there

172
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,831
And I had no idea who he was

173
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
And the

174
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
Turned out that he was a reporter

175
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,023
For the Los Angeles Times

176
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
It was a local store

177
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
One of the people testify

178
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
A teenage boy with Tourette's

179
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
Was from Los Angeles

180
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,471
It resulted in a very short

181
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
Buried in the middle of the paper

182
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
Nobody was likely to see it

183
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,359
Except somebody did

184
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
If you're old enough to have watched

185
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
TV in the 1970s

186
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
The name

187
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,087
Jack Klugman instantly

188
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
Conjure a raspy voice

189
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
Baijiu New Yorker

190
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,231
The sitcom The Odd Couple it was huge

191
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,815
Jack Klugman played a middle-aged slob whose roommates

192
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
Houdini

193
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:10,751
Christmas present I forgot to give it to you Merry Christmas

194
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Assorted cheeses

195
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
When that show ended Jack Klugman got his own brand new TV show

196
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
Kind of detective series

197
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
He played a medical examiner

198
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Call Quincy

199
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:30,207
The Quincy show which was nice entertainment about a doctor who looks at dead bodies

200
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Decided

201
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
Who the murderer was

202
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,863
It was like a precursor to CSI and it was kind of a big deal.

203
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,639
World of forensic medicine and after that little story the Los Angeles Times came out

204
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,199
Abby got a call from some but you said

205
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,015
He was a producer on the Quincy show

206
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
She was skeptical

207
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,671
Thought you said yes and I mrs. Santa Claus

208
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
But after a few minutes on the phone

209
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
She realize

210
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
The guy was telling the truth

211
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
He was a producer for Quincy

212
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,631
Any happen to have

213
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
Fairly rare disease himself

214
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
In fact

215
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
Who is dying

216
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Optum cancer

217
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
And so he

218
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,847
So this whole say with orphan drugs

219
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Is

220
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,479
Beautiful story and I'd really like to do an episode

221
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,575
Of Quincy about it

222
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
His name was Maurice

223
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Klugman

224
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
He was Jack Klugman

225
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:38,303
Brother I mean these things happened in the movies that what happens with real people

226
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
And that's what happened

227
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
The episode actually got made

228
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:48,543
It happened and in the episode a teenager with Tourette's dies under suspicious circumstances

229
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Turns out

230
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
It's not exactly a murder

231
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
But by the time Quincy figures that out

232
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,455
He meets another young man with Tourette's

233
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
And get

234
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Obsessed

235
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
Problem

236
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
Orphan drug

237
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
Is Quincy

238
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
Document that kids death

239
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,927
If you got a disease that happen to have a low incidence

240
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,487
Don't count on the pharmaceutical companies

241
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
That's why they call them orphan drugs

242
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
Merrick

243
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,143
Chores for rare diseases that no one wants to adopt

244
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,007
Listen to go before Congress that supposed to deal with all this drug bill it still being considered

245
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
They should have suddenly goes from a mystery

246
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
To a policy drop

247
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
Quincy it goes all-in on the orphan drugs

248
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,967
He lobbied Pharma companies

249
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:32,063
The FDA Congressman becomes a total policy nerd

250
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,391
At the big finish the kid with Tourette's after a

251
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
Pep talk by Quincy

252
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,743
Gives a blockbuster speech at a congressional hearing

253
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
I'm thinking about

254
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
The other victims

255
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
I might just have tourettes

256
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
But anyone who is unlucky enough

257
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,983
To have a disease that never made it to the top 40

258
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,079
This Congressional hearing was obviously fiction

259
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,895
But it got a real-world response

260
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
When that show was broadcast

261
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
Jack Klugman receive

262
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,343
Thousands and thousands of letters

263
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
And they didn't even open up they just

264
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,719
How do you spell exactly will like

265
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
Santa Claus facts

266
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,327
And they stuffed animal into them

267
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
And they sent all of those

268
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
Sex

269
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
Tumi

270
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:26,335
The letters were from people with rare diseases and people who just wanted to do something to help solve the orphan drug problem

271
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,151
This kind of publicity and support

272
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,967
Abby and her friend got another Congressional hearing

273
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
On March 10th

274
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
1981

275
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,135
Real-life elected officials heard testimony about a real-life proposal

276
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:43,999
To create Financial incentives for Pharma companies to take on Orphan drugs

277
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:49,119
On hand to give that proposal a boost of star power was Jack Klugman himself

278
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,263
The actor food Washington and testified in this new Hearing in Congress this time it was packed

279
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,663
People just sat down on the floor in the aisles

280
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,759
Because Jack Klugman was in the room

281
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,087
I'm telling you Jack Klugman was a big deal in those days

282
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
An orphan drug bill passed the house but

283
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
It got stalled in the Senate

284
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,791
Where Abby heard a single Senator was secretly blocking a

285
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
It was rumored to be Orrin Hatch

286
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,191
So Jack Klugman and his crew swing into action

287
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,751
They do another episode of Quincy

288
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,335
One single Senator is holding up an orphan drug bill

289
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,687
In the climactic scene Quincy confronts that senator in his DC office

290
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,295
I choose to keep going against this

291
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
And you should be ready for the reaction

292
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
I won't be in a reaction

293
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,671
I play this course too many times

294
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
Or maybe the rules have been changed

295
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
I'm just take a look out there

296
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Window shutters

297
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:57,727
Senator glances incredulously toward the window

298
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
Doctor Quincy

299
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
Ben both guys turn

300
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Walk

301
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
Solemnly over

302
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
Is huge picture window and

303
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
Out in the street

304
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:12,319
Big demonstration heading straight toward the Senator's office

305
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:17,695
Camera zooms past the two men that focuses on the action outside

306
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
There are

307
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,791
Hundreds of people lock them in wheelchairs

308
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,095
Colorful signs with slogans like

309
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
Now is the time

310
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
Vote for the orphan drug deal

311
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
Can

312
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:32,287
In a direct pitch to be fictional Senator watching through the window

313
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
We need you Senator Reeves

314
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,919
The sequence Wingers

315
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,575
And lingers and lingers these extras

316
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,183
Are all actual people with rare diseases that Abby Meyers and her colleagues recruited

317
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
Except

318
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,047
Not actually in Washington they shot it in Pasadena or the weather was better

319
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
The fake March on Washington

320
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Totally work

321
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
The fake Senator on the show

322
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:04,799
I cannot support this bill but I won't stand on its way

323
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,895
And so did the real life senator

324
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,991
Orrin Hatch

325
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,367
There would not be an orphan Drug Act if it was not for that episode of Quincy

326
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
The orphan Drug Act

327
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Pass the Senate

328
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,487
President Ronald Reagan signed into law

329
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
The fake March on Washington

330
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,351
Became in some people's minds

331
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
A real life event

332
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,007
People will say to me that March on Washington was wonderful

333
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
There wasn't the March on Washington

334
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,359
But you know it was on TV

335
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,943
Abby Meyers went on to help start a new advocacy

336
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
The National Organization for rare disorders

337
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
She ran it for more than 20 years

338
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
These days

339
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,391
When people ask her about her Legacy

340
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
This is what she tells

341
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
Be careful what you

342
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
Wish for

343
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
It might come true

344
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,423
The orphan Drug Act of 1983

345
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
Created Financial incentives

346
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,775
Pharma companies to develop drugs to treat

347
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
Orphan conditions

348
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,103
Urine Drug Act basically says

349
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,663
Once the FDA agrees proposed treatment

350
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,247
A rare condition undercurrent definition that means that affect

351
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,551
Fewer than 200 thousand people in the US

352
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Ben

353
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
Developer qualifies for special goodies

354
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
That includes subsidy

355
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
Actual taxpayer cash

356
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
Clinical trials

357
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
And

358
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
A big prize at the end

359
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,351
First drug company to get FDA approval

360
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
For certain kind of treatment

361
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Market

362
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Exclusivity

363
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
Basically

364
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,823
No one else can Market an equivalent drug in the US for 7 years

365
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:48,479
Which means that during that seven-year period the company gets a chance to make money off this drug even if relatively few people

366
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,039
Music by setting a higher than usual price

367
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,343
You know if you have a drug for

368
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,623
High blood pressure

369
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,999
It's probably half of the United States needs blood pressure medicine

370
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,143
But with a rare disease you're not going to make money if you charge your normal price for those

371
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,215
Amendra companies realize that if they had a monopoly

372
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,567
It didn't have to charge anything that would be remotely considered a normal price

373
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,871
They can charge pretty much whatever they want it

374
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,199
Especially if the insurance companies were paying for it

375
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,831
It took Pharma companies a few years to catch on to how good a deal the orphan Drug Act be

376
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,879
But by the 1990s

377
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,439
Things were definitely rolling

378
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,303
One rare disease drug came out in 1991 with a price tag of 150

379
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
$1,000 a year

380
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
It was

381
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Huge money

382
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:44,031
Biotechnology and Healthcare companies

383
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
This is Joshua Sean

384
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
And he's one of the many entrepreneurs

385
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,431
Who took advantage of the orphan drug policy

386
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,759
His path to the big Pharma money let through

387
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Las Vegas

388
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
It was great

389
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
Just how Wild West

390
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
This new world

391
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:02,463
Could be in 2003 Joshua shine started a company called Lev Pharmaceuticals

392
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,767
And this company had just one mission

393
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
A single thing it was going to do

394
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
Lev Pharmaceuticals

395
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:13,215
Was going to Market a drug for a rare disorder called hereditary angioedema

396
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Actually

397
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
The drug already existed

398
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,079
It has been used successfully in Europe for 30 years

399
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
But nobody had taken it through clinical trials in the US

400
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
I look like a good setup

401
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,319
It seems like a very good opportunity from its Inception

402
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,903
We saw a serious unmet clinical need in the US

403
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,231
To bring this treatment from Europe to the point where it could be sold in the US

404
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,815
Message Josh wish I would have to raise enough money for live Pharmaceutical

405
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Which

406
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
Would be a lot easier to do

407
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
As a publicly traded company

408
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
And that's how they found

409
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Fun City popcorn

410
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,711
Brightest on a typical path

411
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
Biotech companies

412
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,831
Fun City popcorn sold popcorn and nacho cheese sauce

413
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
The concessionaires all around Las Vegas

414
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
100

415
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
Malls

416
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
Ballparks

417
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Skating rinks

418
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Yunnan

419
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,839
Of course lived in Pursuit FunCity for their nacho cheese sauce recipe

420
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:16,703
It turned out fun cities owners were getting out of the popcorn & concession business

421
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,263
And they were game to try something new

422
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,591
FunCity agreed to actually merge with metformin

423
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
Bestowing on love

424
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,711
Their status as a publicly traded company

425
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Which

426
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,551
Made it easier for love to attract even more in bed

427
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,647
But for a few months until they can get the paperwork sorted out

428
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,183
They had to go by the name

429
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
Funfetti popcorn

430
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
We felt we could

431
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
Overcome

432
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,423
Fun City popcorn than any other jokes that might bring up did people catch you about it

433
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,311
All the way to bank

434
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
Over the next few years

435
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,431
Lev Pharmaceuticals raise about 75 million dollars

436
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,991
To pay for the clinical trial that would win FDA approve

437
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,087
Of course Joshua shine still had to get the trials done and do it

438
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
Before anyone else

439
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
After all the orphan Drug Act

440
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,487
Is set up to give a monopoly to whoever gets to the treatment

441
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
First

442
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Finishing second

443
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
Commune losing whole investment

444
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,863
It was a real horse race

445
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
So you could finish the trials

446
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,215
And shine one that's particular race

447
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,311
Yeah I'm very pleased with how this work out at workout most importantly for patients

448
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:31,711
And of course he's also glad it worked out for the shareholders

449
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:36,319
Please set up a company that we were able to provide a return

450
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
It was a

451
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Big return

452
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
A 2008

453
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,487
A couple weeks before the FDA gave the new drug its final approval

454
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:49,119
Lev Pharmaceuticals sold for 442 million dollars

455
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
And within a few years

456
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,983
The new owner was making 400 million dollars

457
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,775
Back from this one drug

458
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
Every

459
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,127
Year thanks for price tag that made this one of the world

460
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,663
Most expensive drugs

461
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
More than half a million bucks

462
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
A year

463
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Per patient

464
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
That owner

465
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
Sold itself to a

466
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
Still bigger company

467
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
44.2

468
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
Billion dollars

469
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,095
That Company CEO says that the company's entire strategy is to make money from the treatment of rare diseases

470
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,935
The orphan Drug Act and the crazy pricing that is its Legacy

471
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,983
Is this company's whole vision

472
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
For making tons of money

473
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
This is why I be Meyers has mixed

474
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,151
Feelings about her Legacy

475
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
30

476
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,759
35 years later the orphan Drug Act

477
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,599
Has been responsible for the most miraculous

478
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
Treatments

479
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,927
Many many diseases

480
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,487
But some of the companies that make

481
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
These drugs I put

482
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,143
Prices on number that is makes the drugs absolutely unaffordable

483
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,959
In other words it's like a ransom note

484
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,775
Thousands of Desperately ill people

485
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,383
Joshua Shine from left Pharmaceuticals has a different perspective

486
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
He says

487
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,223
It is hard enough to get money to develop these drugs

488
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
Even with

489
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
The orphan Drug Act incentives

490
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
2 payout

491
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,135
Drug by hugely expensive Isabella

492
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
And the failures

493
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:22,048
Far far outnumber the successes and without a system in place like you're the Drug Act

494
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
Of course it doesn't have to be this way

495
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,288
Abby Meyers and others have their own proposals for out-of-balance incentives with reasonable prices

496
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
It's a giant debate

497
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,920
If you look at a list of the most expensive drugs

498
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
You noticed two things

499
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Unbelievably

500
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,064
Tens of thousands of dollars a month

501
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
And

502
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,648
They are generally for air condition

503
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
Insurance companies patients

504
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
Dothan contributes to the

505
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
Spiraling cost of Health

506
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,192
It's going to take more than a fake TV March on Washington

507
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,496
The fix the problem

508
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:23,488
If you'd like to know more about how the cost of healthcare has gotten so messed up and what we may be able to do about it

509
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,792
You just like really good storytelling

510
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,120
Check out Dan weitsmans new podcast called an arm and a leg

511
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,424
But more about that show after the break

512
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:46,528
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

513
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,344
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

514
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:56,000
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis talking to me in my

515
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:00,608
Wife is in another room in a hearing.

516
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
Technology talk to us

517
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
It is a creation of Sonic trash

518
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:11,360
That's Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

519
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,152
To make them more human

520
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
Turn the living room lights on

521
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,040
Okay

522
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
Dim the living room lights

523
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
50%

524
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
Okay

525
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,792
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

526
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,608
Makes for a much more natural experience

527
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,656
Turn the living room lights on

528
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Dim the living room lights to 50

529
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
80%

530
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:47,456
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

531
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,248
Landscape is impacting our health

532
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,808
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

533
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,624
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

534

NPI phase

We need to talk about something constipation abdominal pain and bloating you tell yourself it's not that bad

537
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:10,496
You take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating

538
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:16,896
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

539
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
Then it may be time to seek help

Black podcast

544
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,584
Dan Weisman is a journalist based in Chicago you may remember that he reported a couple

545
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,656
Stories with us over the years about the reversing of the Chicago River

546
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:42,496
And how the popularity of Billiards drove the development of plastic

547
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,312
And as we mentioned he now has a show about Healthcare

548
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
Called an arm and a leg

549
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,920
I asked him why he was compelled to create a podcast

550
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,712
About this particular subject

551
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,832
I've been interested in this topic for a long time and partly for personal reasons

552
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
I thought about

553
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
Going out of my own as

554
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
Reporter and said

555
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Work for somebody else

556
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,024
For a while I want to do but

557
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,584
Who's going to buy the health insurance for a family

558
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
My wife

559
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
Classroom business

560
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
Unthinkable

561
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
And I found myself

562
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
1 jobs

563
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
Crap I might need

564
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
A new career

565
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
Which was really

566
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
Sad for me

567
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,992
Is this one thing

568
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,576
This kind of running my life and I I know I'm not the only person

569
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Which is

570
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,160
Yeah the cost of healthcare and the need for

571
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
Health insurance

572
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Expensive that

573
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
You just drives

574
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
So many decisions

575
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
For so many people

576
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
I don't see

577
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,632
A conversation about

578
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
Or kind of accessible conversation about

579
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
How do we get here

580
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,056
Or anything any of us can do

581
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
Annies

582
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,920
How did we get here the driving question

583
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,760
Or is it how do we solve it look where do you place the emphasis in the show

584
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
That is a super good question

585
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,904
It's a good question

586
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
I I think

587
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
Because of my disposition

588
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
They're like

589
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,048
Are some good stories in how we got

590
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,864
There's two

591
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,912
Good things about that in one is it

592
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,960
Understanding how we got here might help us

593
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
Understand a little bit

594
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
About how we could

595
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
Make people better

596
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
Innocent like

597
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
One of the things

598
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
Is it

599
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
Bee Company

600
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,296
Keep it like we're all kind of scared and angry and can

601
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
Refused

602
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
End

603
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,160
Telling some interesting maybe fun stories

604
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,696
Is also just a way to

605
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,744
Half the time to bring her blood pressure down

606
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,024
To the point we actually

607
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,816
We could like see our way clear to do

608
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,888
As you've been Gathering the stories

609
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,448
Is there an underlying theme that submerged

610
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
That

611
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
Surprised

612
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,800
Surprise me first was just from talking to

613
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
Gout

614
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
Doing the show

615
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
Every

616
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
Single person

617
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,944
I would talk to mrs.

618
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,224
I'd say pretty much remained

619
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
Will either write

620
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Off the bat

621
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,856
Or as we get to talkin do you like oh yeah well

622
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,184
This is a story that happened to me

623
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,232
Probably the single biggest private life ever

624
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Every

625
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,424
One of these examples in your pilot with your friend Peter can you describe the situation with Peter

626
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,704
Is a real estate developer

627
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Ndk

628
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
Makes a perfectly good salary

629
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,384
Yeah you know the health insurance at my job

630
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,176
Just keeps getting worse and worse

631
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,480
And last year my deductible was like

632
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,784
$18,000

633
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Person

634
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,880
Oh wait and did I tell you about when I had the kidney stone last

635
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,696
You know

636
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,792
I put off going to get help for as long as I possibly could

637
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,888
Cuz he was like they're just going to charge money not be able to do anything for him

638
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,216
And he finally breaks down his wife makes him go to the hospital

639
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,752
And they give him an MRI

640
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
And

641
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
He is kicking himself

642
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,384
And they told me exactly what I knew that I had a kidney stone

643
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,736
And that's why he was passing and I'm like thank you very much

644
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,760
And then

645
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
I get the bill

646
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,344
Well it was $6,500

647
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,904
Oh my God and you had it was all on you

648
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,696
It was all on me

649
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,768
It didn't help me in any way shape or form

650
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
And then I'm left with this bill

651
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,632
Peter one of the things that I find

652
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
You know offland

653
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
It's about the story

654
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Is

655
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,288
A real estate developer you know

656
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,848
Your real estate

657
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
Negotiating with

658
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,688
People likes a contract resume most people would

659
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
Never thinks they were

660
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,992
Slicking up to 2

661
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,784
Is what you actually do for a living

662
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
And I can't negotiate this

663
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,488
And so if you want to hear that story and its entirety you have to subscribe to an arm and a leg

664
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,768
Thank you. I appreciate it

688
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:41,152
Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

689
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:45,248
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a

690
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,296
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

691
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,832
We're looking the part

692
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
Might cost you your life

693
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:56,768
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

694
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,840
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

695
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:04,448
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

696
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,800
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

697
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:13,152
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of

698
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,576
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

699
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,904
Was found dead in my private gym

700
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,232
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

701
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:31,584
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

702
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,912
Now I need to clear my name

703
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:40,288
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

704
