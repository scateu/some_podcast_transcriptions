45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,320
Probably an under-appreciated design element

46
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,392

If you think a slightly broken escalator can't be lovable

66
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
Or maybe you have been paying attention

67
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,696
An escalator on a DC Metro platform is like a fine wine

68
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,768
It's better with age and without any industrial lubricant

69
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,632
Sam lives in Baltimore now we lived in DC for a few years he said that this sound

70
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:54,240
Came to embody the excitement he felt from living in a city

71
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,568
Yeah I mean I grew up in one of Florida's most

72
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
Depressing suburbs

73
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,920

75
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Very nice

76
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,576
Just want to move to DC I took public transit everywhere just because I could

77
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,672
The DC Metro System it's not the best in the world but it's pretty good

78
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
Although a lot of people do Lament

79
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,024
The poor condition of the Metro escalator

80
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:21,631
Broken and then there are some that work but make these crazy noise

81
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,959
Which you know I know a lot of people but for me

82
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:30,591
I found it a scrogging escalator was like this little Trumpeter announcing how awesome it was

83
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
To live in the city

84
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,015
It turns out that someone else loves this sound too so this is Chris Richards

85
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
I'm the pop music critic at the Washington Post

86
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:46,463
Chris is also in a band called q and not U hero. Kind of appreciation of the Metro escalators for the Post

87
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,511
For the Farragut North Metro Station

88
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559
In Washington DC on the north side

89
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
Bell Street

90
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
Medical Avenue Chris told me that he'd never really noticed the sound of the escalators made until one day when he was on a bit of a

91
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
Having my ear trainer

92
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
For those sort of

93
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
Breath on brass kind of sound

94
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,455
I think maybe turning the corner to come down the escalators one day I thought there's a saxophone player

95
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
Playing at the bottom

96
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Of the Metro

97
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
But it was not at all

98
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
There's kind of like

99
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Walking in

100
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Reaching away

101
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,207
Maybe I don't know if they're always has loud

102
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,351
On the escalator there's a plastic element on the side of each step that keeps it from rubbing against the metal siding

103
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,655
A lubricant keeps it all running smoothly

104
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,727
But when it rains or snows the lubrication wears off

105
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
So what you're hearing when you hear these kind of like

106
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
Morning squawk

107
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
Steel stairs

108
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
Rubbing up and Chase

109
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Tap Plastic

110
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,967
Kind of like a beautiful

111
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
Serendipitous Aftershock

112
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Of the wear and tear

113
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
It sounds like music

114
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,391
And like any good music critic

115
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,231
Chris started classifying the different styles of Metro escalator

116
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,631
So here at Farragut North the escalators might sound like whales mating or something like that

117
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
Whereas the escalator at U Street

118
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:10,175
Kind of sounded like Indian drum music

119
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Columbia Heights

120
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
An Aviary of chrome part of ravens taunting you as you descend into your work day

121
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,303
We understand that we could be over-romanticizing escrow knocking and squeaking escalator

122
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
You can talk all day about

123
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,911
Appreciating the ambience soundscape around you and

124
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,519
Get really into aestheticized ways of listening Chris Richards was big on this by the way

125
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,919
But you could also just as easily say you don't hate this is all noise I think it's all really in the year of the beholder so

126
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,015
It is totally understandable that people wouldn't appreciate a screeching escalator

127
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
Chris actually told me

128
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,135
That when he called up Metro for his story their PR people didn't believe him

129
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:57,535
They thought he was running some big expose about escalator failure

130
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
Baby down

131
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
This is a wonderful little residual

132
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
Bonus

133
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,983
My point of view is if you're going to be subjected to some kind of sensory experience

134
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,311
Of which you have no control every single day then it's to your

135
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
Benefit

136
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
Why not

137
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Try to enjoy it

138
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
Because there's no

139
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
Things in life

140
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
Play stressed out about

141
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,527
As much as people complain about what that all the sounds of cities making all the noise that the city's make

142
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
I think those noises to find it at

143
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:25,951
You really become our environment sound to be an irritation or can be information

144
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,279
Helping the escalators never get fixed

145
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
Except the ones that just straight-up don't work

146
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
The escalator stop

147
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,959
It is the longest escalator in the Western Hemisphere

148
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,031
It's 3 minutes to ride to the top when it's working

149
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,127
Let's hope that the Wheaton escalator doesn't conveniently become stairs

150
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,943

Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

166
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
The body genius is a dark

167

Comic mystery

168
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,783

171
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:35,231
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

172
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,583
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

173
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,935
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

174
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,287
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

175
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
Actually if I'm being honest

176
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

177
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:59,039
I think a few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an act
