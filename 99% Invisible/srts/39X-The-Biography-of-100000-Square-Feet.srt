I'm Roman Mars

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,368
In the center of San Francisco there's a plaza with no benches

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
Central feature at the entrance of the plaza is it unique fountain that was designed by Lawrence Halprin in 19

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
75

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,632
The water shoots out at various angles from inside

34
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
Sunken pit

35
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
Filled with large

36
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
Granite slabs

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
It's a design that kind of

38
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:26,688
Hold you in and invites you to take the steps down to the water and climb in between the Hawking stones

39
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
And that's

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
Part of the problem

41
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:35,904

Call the invisible ink in May of 2004

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,496
The dock Texas really hard look at UN Plaza when it was at its absolute worst

46
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
And ask

47
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,312
What I think is a really interesting question

48
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,080
Is there a

49
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
Point

50
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:59,968
We're good intentions and idealism of a certain design become so removed from reality

51
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
That it actually

52
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
Borders on negligence

53

Stay tuned and I'll give you a short update on UN Plaza

57
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960

Here's been temperature

59
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
This is the biography

60
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
Of 100000 square feet

61
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,016
At the heart of San Francisco there is a crossroad

62
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
Square Market

63
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
The Civic Center

64
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,928
It's called United Nations Plaza or less formally

65
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,208
Urination Plaza

66
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,024
And for most of the past three decades

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
It has been San Francisco's most public theater

68
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
Squalor

69
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Misery

70
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
Sickness

71
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,984
That plays UN Plaza was with was a madhouse

72
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,824
You can go to any all the Desi needles

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
Liquor bottles

74
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,712
People fighting people urinating and defecating in that fountain that

75
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
That that's

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
Unsanitary

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,856
I see people shoot up at 1 and go to the other end and die

78
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
I saw that

79
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
Not easily

80
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
People don't scroll down streets and

81
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
You know I'm playing

82
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,887
Botchief it's not the mentality to use these big wide-open Plaza

83
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
It's never worked

84
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,215
I worked in UN Plaza for a summer

85
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Walked across

86
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
The brick paving

87
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
Really wide u27

88
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335

Pastor Granite fountain

90
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
Protected by a yellow plastic

Chain

92
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
Through the thicket

93
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
Abdullah a crack smoker

94
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,807
Dealers who circled among the Bronze Star

95
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
All that's left of the benches

96
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,903
They cut them out with saws and remove them

97
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,999
I started spending time in United Nations on my days off

98
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
Talking to the people

99
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
Question I was after

100
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,351
Why does a public

101
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Baseball

102
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
Derek Armstrong was there most days I was

103
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
Derek was enormous

104
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
400

105
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,591
Pounds and he sat on the planter bed walls everyday

106
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
Eating from bags of Cheetos

107
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
And listening to His Radio

108
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
I asked him

109
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,991
Why do you come down to UN Plaza

110
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:15,391
As you apply the centrally-located to a lot of homeless services that I used mainly Saint Anthony

111
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,695
UN Plaza is on the Glide path

112
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
Redo of San Francisco's poorest neighborhood

113
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
The tenderloin

114
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
And Soma

115
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607

116

Centrally located Nino netease

117
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,751
One Saturday I went down to watch some evangelist

118
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Preach to the Lost

119
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Sol's in United Nation

120
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Plaza

121
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,919
When the preachers used to be homeless there himself

122
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:44,319
Had a. In my own ways

123
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
Off away from the main body of the audience I saw a man sitting against the black metal poles Circle

124
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
The fountain

125
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,559
He was behind the preachers and their loudspeakers

126
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
Watching

127
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
I asked them

128
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,167
Why are you sitting over here and not over there

129
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,215
Because I don't

130
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,775
Want to partake in anything right now

131
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
How many

132
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
I'm pretty much

133
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,663
Close myself away from everything

134
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,735
His name is Wendell Edwards

135
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
For sleeping on the sidewalk

136
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
And let out the same day

137
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,463
I lost a lot of love for the United States flag behind that

138
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,303
Because they made me feel like an enemy like I was part of the Taliban or something

139
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
And my father died fighting for this country

140
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,519
So when I was arrested that mentally really hurt me against the flag because I could

141
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,919
Breaking in somebody called I could have been hurting any of these people and taking their wallet at night

142
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,735
Catching them coming out of the storehouse or anyting

143
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
And I did none of that

144
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
It wasn't in my heart to do that

145
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,463
But it wasn't her heart to arrest me for sleeping merely sleeping on the sidewalk and I'll never forget that I still

146
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,767
Forgot to take it in my pocket it was just last week

147
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
And the devil keep telling me that

148
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Since that happened

149
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,167
Don't you see what they trying to do to you

150
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,703
Go out and pay him back

151
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
Go Robert storm

152
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,823
Cuz you don't have no flag you don't have no country

153
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
You don't have nothing

154
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
They don't want you to be a part of it

155
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,199
That's just a nice way of saying

156
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
Niger get out of San Francisco

157
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,087
How did it get this bad

158
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,439
How did the space commemorating What are the great institutions in human history

159
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
At the heart of the richest city

160
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
And the richest

161
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Country Inn

162
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
A place of so much

163
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
Promise

164
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
Turn out so wrong

165
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,215
My assignment was to develop Market Street over again

166
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
I said no Promenade

167
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,103
From the ferry building to the City Hall this is Lawrence helper

168
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:48,991
My idea and the whole idea for the city and our team and Design

169
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:54,879
What's the make a formal entrance to City Hall that people would admire and wood

170
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,719
Perceive as an important part of the formal quality of

171
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Downtown area

172
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
Lake Perris

173
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
Have you ever been to Paris

174
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
In 1972

175
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,959
The city spent 24 million dollars beautifying markets

176
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
Richard been torn up for the installation of a Subway

177
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,615
The final section of the redesign was United Nation

178
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Plaza

179
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
The city hired Halperin

180
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
To make the design

181
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,783
There is this quality of formality that we were at

182
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,599
An expressive the culture of a city

183
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
That was what we were thinking about

184
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,999
The importance of linear visual experiences

185
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,351
The blinking of one place to another instead of the kind of

186
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
Informality of neighborhoods where little streets go wandering around and you don't get any long

187
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Longview

188
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,127
Lawrence Halprin is one of the most celebrated Landscape Architects alive today

189
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:53,503
He has been awarded the presidential medal of the Arts he designed the FDR Memorial in Washington DC

190
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
He designed the Promenade around Jerusalem

191
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,647
He has designed some of the most noted and famous public plazas

192
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
We wanted to make a statement

193
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
In the Greek sense

194
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,351
The visual qualities have to express what the politics of Summer

195
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Not little daughter

196
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
Political this is a Nazi

197
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
Such a measure quality of

198
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
What's idiotic

199
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Daylight

200
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
What it stands for

201
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Wasn't

202
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
Called United

203
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,687
But hell no that wasn't anything like that

204
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,527
City planners designated the space UN Plaza after the decision

205
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Close the intern

206
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
The intersection was closed

207
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
Because of the unique aspect of

208
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
The city's Urban Design

209
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,535
Peter bosselman chair of the Department of urban planning at the University of California

210
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,863
Plains lizard pecunia geometry about San Francisco

211
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,727
Market Street was lined up to connect the Waterfront with a set of hills

212
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
It's called Twin Peaks

213
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:53,407
But it is not aligned to the city grid Market runs at a 45 degree angle creating or kind

214
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,759
Signs of strange intersections where streets into Market Street never 90 degree angle

215
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Always 45

216
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,439
But even for San franciscans is very confusing to find the connection between the south of Market in the north of Market

217
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
Very few streets lineup

218
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,303
The design helping came up with for United Nations

219
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
Was a stately Gateway

220
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
From arches to pass through

221
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,983
The Marchers would be funneled from the wide edge of the plaza that runs along Market Street

222
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,055
Between two lines of trees in raised planter bed

223
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,407
And then out through the space between the library and the Asian Art Museum

224
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,943
The vast green lawns

225
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
Civic Center Plaza

226
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
The centerpiece

227
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,575
Is the 165 ft long fountain

228
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,903
It contains 673 blocks of granite

229
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,719
Laying somewhere between three and four million tons

230
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
I took the idea of the High Sierra surrounding the bay itself and down in here you can see

231
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
See the bay

232
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,215
And I even developed a system

233
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,799
Of the Tide's coming in there was an hour long

234
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
Tidal action

235
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
Was Piper's out and then

236
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Large.

237
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,711
Brew and Grow till it was up on these

238
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Peeks

239
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,063
What you see in other words is a three-dimensional

240
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
Plaza

241
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,135
Which is unique has an idea

242
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
This title system no longer exists

243
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,303
Because maintenance was so terrible that's going to hell

244
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
Popsalot like

245
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,423
Relationships between people unless you take care of them

246
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
They go to hell

247
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,519
The fountain design was not immediately popular with

248
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
What city planners

249
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
In December 1970

250
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,407
The chairman of the Civic design committee said it was awful

251
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
Flamboyant

252
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,735
An example of a designer's egotism

253
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
Being passed on to the people is a

254
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
The piece of art

255
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,855
Ruth Asawa and acclaim San

256
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
Cisco sculptor said

257
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
As corny as this may sound

258
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,511
You have to design places in the city for people to sit on the grass

259
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
Sit under trees

260
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
ProFlowers

261
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Birds

262
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
Even her obtain gun

263
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,423
When he called the Fountain of monstrosity

264
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
That must

265
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
B stock

266
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
But after five years

267
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
The planning in arguing

268
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
It was Bell anyway

269
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
Chris Adams has worked in the plaza

270
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
For more than 20 years

271
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,991
When that Fountain Blue Water it was supposed to work with the Wind

272
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
If the wind blew too far the water was supposed to go down

273
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
I've been here since app

274
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,439
Fountain was put in and I've never ever seen it work correctly

275
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,559
It's blowing 50 feet in the air in the winter and the water just pouring

276
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:24,703
And then the fact that it did start to stink the chemicals that were put in there killed all the trees that were around it

277
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,287
Children wanted to play in there and of course you don't want

278
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
Kids in that water many of the worries

279
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Expressed by critics of

280
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
The design quickly came to

281
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Pass

282
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,479
In June of 1979

283
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,039
Less than a year after the fountain was completed

284
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,135
A columnist for the San Francisco Examiner wrote an article about the Vandals

285
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
Derelict and social Miss

286
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Who are turning the space

287
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,535
Into a garbage strewn graffiti two-faced mockery

288
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
Kevin Starr Road

289
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,423
What should have been the new Triumph and entering

290
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
H2r Civic Center

291
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
Is a resort

292
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
For Daryl

293
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,335
Thumbs Merchants all along Market Street

294
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Great hope

295
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895
The transformation of Mark

296
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Whitaker

297
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,503
And it never happened if things went the other way

298
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
Bob Prentiss

299
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,343
Was the director of homeless Services Under mayor art agnos

300
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
From 1988 tonight

301
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
Ready to the merchants were

302
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
Extremely frustrated

303
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,303
Because of these you know these frustrated expectations that

304
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
Took the form of now

305
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143
People actually hanging out in the plaza

306
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
It was just

307
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
A Tinderbox

308
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,007
That was the environment of the UN Plaza

309
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,079
Pretty much from the time that I started working in the mayor's off

310
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
Office in 1980

311
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,151
The Market Street associate

312
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
An organization of business owners

313
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Property owned

314
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
Called for a farmers market

315
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
Be putting you in Plaza

316
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
Chris Adams runs the Farmers Market

317
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:51,487
I know it wasn't raining it was a nice sunny day 1980-81 when I believe it was

318
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Springtime

319
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,815
12 farmers drove up with their trucks

320
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,143
And they did not sell out

321
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,959
But as they came weekly which is

322
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,751
What are Roots down there and

323
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
We're here to stay

324
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
It was some people in the neighborhood over

325
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
I'm trying to think of ways

326
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
To heal the Plaza

327
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
The end of the farmers market with

328
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
Poor people are

329
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
It's harder for them to go

330
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
It's not about

331
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,927
Driving them away it's about civilizing the places where they live

332
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,535
They can come out they can breathe out there it is part of the tenderloin

333
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
That's there

334
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
Front room

335
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
I've been told that

336
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
By almost all of the

337
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
Our place

338
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,263
Can see the refrigerators couches chairs

339
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
I don't want to

340
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Push them out of there

341
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
I just

342
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Shareit

343
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
Bob Prentiss again

344
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,991
It was a way to take over some use of that Plaza

345
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
With a purpose of supporting everybody

346
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
The idea that you would bring

347
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,415
Farmers markets in the Heart of the City where there was no Rito go

348
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
People who

349
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,511
Lived on the lowest incomes could not get decent

350
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
A decent prices

351
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
To me that's the spirit behind

352
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,471
Dealing with the seeming inevitability of poverty without being mean spirited

353
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Chrisatm

354
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
The director of

355
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
The Farmers Market

356
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
I've been home

357
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Good night

358
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
Teens

359
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
70

360
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
I lived in a car for two weeks with

361
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Kids

362
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
It was no way I was going to stay

363
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
That's one reason I was hired

364
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
Not that I could do office work

365
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
But I got a long way

366
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
The people outside

367
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,071
I can get along with a few all the nationalities

368
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
I enjoy it

369
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
I think it's

370
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,447
Fine as a place that occurs every now and then

371
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Good

372
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
Yes

373
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
On Wednesdays

374
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
Office workers in the

375
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,431
These neighborhoods skip microwave lunches gobbled at their desks

376
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,247
And head out instead to the Heart of the City Farmers

377
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,855
On Sundays it's a neighborhood crowd moving between the white tents

378
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Wanda plaza

379
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,439
Folding tables covered with yellow squash

380
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Blueberries

381
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
Salad greens all organic

382
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
The customers are from all over

383
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
The farmers

384
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
Are from all over

385
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,679
That's why I love being where we are I mean

386
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
Cambodia

387
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
Vietnam

388
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
Mexico

389
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Italy

390
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,127
All over the world the heart of the city was a perfect name for

391
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,175
Fort because I thought that solution

392
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
Demonstrated

393
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
The kind of heart

394
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,807
It wasn't tension between the street people the ones that ran the other mark

395
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
I remember that

396
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
You think you know this is a civil way

397
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
To make due

398
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
With a situation

399
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:37,375
It's so far has been pretty lousy oh my gosh it's United Nations

400
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,959
But on days when the farmer's market and the newer less successful aunt

401
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
Flash flea market

402
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
Aren't in the plaza

403
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
United Nations reverts to what it used to be

404
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
At the East End of the Plaza

405
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:52,479
Between the glass windows of the fast-food franchise and stares down into the subway station

406
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
The Thieves Market moves

407
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:59,647
Black Market salesman fill the 20ft neatly laid-out close hand tools

408
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
Pornographic videos

409
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,231
Consumer electronics of

410
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
Questionable provenance

411
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:11,167
2 days before Thanksgiving I went down to the plaza to ask the salesman what have you got to sell today

412
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,471
I got the sweater purple sweater

413
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,871
And I got glasses again hat I got a new pair of under breast

414
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
Shoes Nike jacket

415
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,711
And I Got a Woman fly

416
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:29,599
My name is Zachary I was born in Ventura but I came down here about 15 15 years ago in

417
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
The general sense

418
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,695
My mother died in January in

419
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
Like

420
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
What's that March

421
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
Yeah I started it like

422
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
You don't go gambling

423
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,935
And I lost all my money so I'm out here now

424
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
I was just

425
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,823
Choosing everything to me you know and

426
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
I take that out my gambling

427
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
And somewhat

428
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
You know

429
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,735
Cursing God

430
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,807
While we were talking the drug addicts

431
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,135
Distinguishable from the merely homeless by their lack of luggage

432
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
Begin to line up

433
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Against the windows

434
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
Carl's jr.

435
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
Hook everybody's all lined up

436
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,351
Why they are lined up

437
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
I don't know

438
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
He's bleeding

439
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
That guy with the dreadlocks

440
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,847
Taking blood off his nose

441
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
Another panaca in Hangouts

442
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,199
That's what makes them say okay there

443
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
Uncivilized

444
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,527
Yeah you guys must have punched a guy

445
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
So you going to clear up

446
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
Yeah I got to go down the way

447
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,719
Zachary packed up his meager merchandise

448
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,767
I went to find out what was going on

449
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
A Taurus

450
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,863
I bought food at the Carl's Junior to give away to the homeless

451
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
My name is Keisha Morris

452
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,263
My intention to be in California is two by two big buildings

453
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
Take the homeless off the street

454
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,639
It's hard to explain is a dream

455
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
I had

456
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
And

457
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
It's coming to pass

458
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,015
I've been driving around

459
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
This block twice

460
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,671
And this was the sign the people in front of Carl's jr.

461
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
So I know this was the place to rest

462
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:18,399
Play outside please

463
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
Manager tried to bring the food out

464
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:31,199
Seven police officers when he got outside the line collapse order

465
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,599
Broke down completely

466
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:50,399
He doesn't have to do this

467
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,799
I see how it is

468
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
This is Muhammad

469
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
The manager of the

470
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,295
Carl's jr. Serve the food to the hungry homeless people

471
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:13,695
Then I told him to wait outside on the line so I will pass soon as I get ready I will be outside

472
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,255
Fighting together I don't know why they start fighting

473
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
When I came outside

474
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
Start grabbing the food from the box

475
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:28,543
That's enough

476
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,663
In miniature this food Riot restate

477
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,711
The failure of UN Plaza itself

478
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,783
A dream that proved no match for its burden

479
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,855
Halpern to had a vision for something decent

480
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
The grace

481
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
The public spaces

482
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,231
But when this dream was overlaid on a real place

483
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
Just didn't work out

484
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,327
I'm not sure if

485
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,423
Now if I were going to be asked to design this is how much I would change

486
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
I mean why would I

487
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
You're talkin about my life's work for Christ sakes

488
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:08,223
I was the first person who ever designed a plaza and Fountain so that people could use it people

489
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
Should not be told you can't

490
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,807
Get inside of it and use it

491
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,928
All places should be usable by people in the city

492
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
Now having said that

493
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,816
Why would I design something to prevent homeless

494
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
I mean

495
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,680
Homelessness is a social problem

496
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,568
That cannot be designed for and in the sense of Aesthetics and culture

497
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Of course they should be friends

498
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,176
That's a real question is what do you mean by friendly

499
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,528
Nobody is ever said to me I want you to design it unfriendly place

500
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,832
But you know it depends on who you talk to

501
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
When you say

502
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,928
You talk to people who say that to other

503
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,792
Sounds like a pretty stupid thing to say actually

504
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
I would absolutely challenge

505
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,656
I can't imagine that anybody

506
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
Say anything

507
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
In mm

508
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:06,336
The Department of Public Works applied for and was awarded Federal Grant

509
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
Need to clean up the 28th

510
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
Eight-year-old Plaza

511
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
Almost a million dollars

512
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,712
Enough to make real changes to

513
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
Did the design

514
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
This is Judy Mosqueda

515
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
A project manager

516
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
The Department of Public Works

517
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,392
I first got to know United Nations Plaza

518
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
Back in 1979

519
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,536
I used to take BART into the plaza with my sister I was about

520
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
12 years old

521
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:32,960
I was not a fast Walker and I remember so vividly my sister walking as fast as she could Up Leavenworth Street because

522
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,264
There were men harassing us along the way

523
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:42,176
And I would have to jog alongside her to keep up with her and that was embarrassing to me

524
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,736
Plan for the redesign had already been drawn up

525
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:50,112
Landscape Architects here at the Department of Public Works had made some recommendations for improvements to a

526
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,208
Things like replanting planter beds with flowers instead of the grass

527
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,512
It's there now something that would add color

528
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,304
A little bit of life to the plaza

529
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,120
As we went to the Board of Supervisors

530
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:05,216
The fencing around the Planters became a contentious issue

531
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:09,824
In December 2001 the plan drawn up by DPW was rejected by the boar

532
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
They didn't like the fences

533
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,712
A 15-member task force was created by the city

534
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,040
The taskforce ask Roma designed to make some recommendations

535
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,832
This is Boris drama

536
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
A principal at Roma

537
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:27,232
The mayor's office he was not too pleased with what was being proposed and I said

538
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:32,608
They're the standard kinds of things to prevent people from using space

539
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,264
The first step is you take out the benches then you put little fences around the green areas then you put barrier

540
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,568
Beers for people so they can sit down

541
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,896
And I said frankly I'm not interested in

542
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
The negative

543
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,480
Approaches 15 people with an interest

544
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
Sometimes competing in

545
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
We're appointed by the

546
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Supervisors

547
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,392
To come up with a plan that would fix up the plaza without displacing anyone

548
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,208
The chair was Lynn Valente of the market

549
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
Street associate

550
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,768
Is it the same markets

551
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
Street associate

552
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
Mission that had created the popular Farmers Market

553
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
20 years

554
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,680
Before people that are part of marketers Association

555
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
But have properties in

556
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,240
Who will live in work up there

557
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,032
Their number one request

558
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
Get that sound out of it

559
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
Because people were

560
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,688
Essentially living in a defecating and

561
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
Urinating in the fountain

562
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,784
And shooting up drugs the fountain

563
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,112
All that kind of stuff having sex and I mean they've seen everything

564
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
In the end

565
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,720
The task force left Halperin streamm4u en Plaza behind

566
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,280
Roma recommended they remove the fountain

567
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,072
But a street through the Thieves Market

568
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,864
Did any fact change United Nation

569
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Shins from a formal play

570
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,424
A place for March

571
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,216
A Public Square in helper

572
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
French words representative

573
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,288
What are the ideals of a government

574
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
China City

575
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
And turned instead

576
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
Add to exactly what helper

577
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
Didn't want

578
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:55,808
Informality of neighborhoods where little streets go wandering around and you don't get any longer

579
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
Longview

580
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,856
This is Boris grandma

581
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,672
This is really a spray tan

582
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,512
That's been closed predominantly for traffic reasons

583
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:09,120
Fulton Street created a very awkward intersection with Market Street

584
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:14,752
And Traffic Engineers don't like triangular intersection so they tend to eliminate

585
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,128
Not because they thought it was the best place to create a gathering space

586
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,992
One has to question should be an open space of this size in this location

587
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
Why would you put it here

588
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
In Spring of 2003

589
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,368
The plaza hit bottom

590
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,184
The plan drawn up by the task force

591
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,976
Appointed by the Board of Supervisors

592
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,792
After a year-and-a-half and more than 20 meeting

593
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
Was rejected

594
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
By the board of

595
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
Supervisors

596
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
Around the same time

597
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,984
Channel 4 ran in extremely unflattering music out

598
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
Squalor in the plaza

599
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,336
Everywhere you turn people smoking crack

600
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,128
All day everyday

601
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,456
The mayor says he'll consider shutting down the fountain

602
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,784
Removing the benches and building gated playgrounds

603
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:07,488
Within hours mayor Willie Brown had made his decision about United Nation

604
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
Plaza

605
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,816
City workers cut through the bronze legs

606
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
24 bench

607
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
And by morning

608
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,144
Gone

609
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,704
I think people felt like they lost the battle of Yuan

610
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,264
That are vacating the premises now

611
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
They're taking the

612
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:24,384
The benches outfits contested terrain where they've given up hope they're going to win

613
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
Lynn Valenti of the Market Street associate

614
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
And would come up with now

615
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,296
After years and years and years

616
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,832
Community input

617
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
I wish I did

618
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,416
8 or 9

619
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:43,328
Caution tape around the fountain no it's not caution tape anymore it's a yellow plastic fence

620
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,376
I don't understand how that happened

621
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,984
I understand how it happened but it just

622
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
Sticks in my craw

623
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,104
Did the first plan that they came up with the fencing that were

624
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,432
Posing with no higher than 3 ft tall

625
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
Was not acceptable

626
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,296
Promethazine came in

627
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:09,696
I thought people drive down or bicycle down

628
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,304
And that's how it's been for almost a year

629
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
Flowers

630
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,864
No fences

631
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
No benches

632
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:25,056
The crack addicts have mostly been pushed out by the pervasive police presence and the street sweepers that Circle Khan

633
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,104
Do you like fish in an aquarium

634
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:32,992
The homeless people who used to sit on the planter beds are fewer in number but they're still there

635
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,320
Many of them have shifted 50ft toward City Hall

636
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,624
Where they sit inside a large sculpture

637
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,208
San Francisco's Pioneers in the middle of a traffic circle

638
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
It would be a stretch

639
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,536
To say this is an improved

640
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
Have you been

641
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,424
No I purposely don't go there usually

642
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:57,312
Have you seen the pictures of the chain-link fence around the fountain I know about

643
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,408
The city and the project manager for that

644
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,712
Project has been very

645
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
Careful about

646
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,320
Traffic keeping us advised about what's going on

647
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
He's trying to

648
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,440
Recapture some of the original quality to play sand

649
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,256
Also deal with some of the social issues

650
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,096
That are encroaching on them

651
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,192
I think some people want to turn that into something is never going to be

652
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,544
You know it's not going to be a renaissance that's not going to happen

653
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
I mean

654
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,896
This is part of the tenderloin and that

655
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:38,784
Influence is always going to be there I'm sorry but I think that's how it should read I really do

656
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,856
Why do you cut off the daily life of a city

657
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,952
In order to create a space for special events

658
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
The only occur

659
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,792
A few times a year

660
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,584
I would question whether

661
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
We should have an open space

662
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
Abyss size at this location

663
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,216
Rather than allowing

664
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,032
The traditional elements of City form

665
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,336
Like streets sidewalks

666
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,616
2xist

667
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,664
Judy Mosqueda is optimistic

668
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,712
But it is a resign.

669
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
The funds were to be expended

670
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,832
Buy I believe June 2003

671
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:18,976
Obviously I've missed that deadline I'm now shooting for June 2005 and I hope to be successful for that

672
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
And if

673
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,304
San franciscans can't come just concept

674
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,632
Consensus on what should happen in this Plaza

675
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
I may ask for another extension

676
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,032
Or we may decide that San Francisco doesn't know what

677
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,312
What to do with this Plaza

678
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
This point in time

679
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,712
Before San Francisco gives up on United Nations Plaza

680
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,808
We might want to consider some words of advice given by President Harry Truman

681
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,856
When the charter for the real United Nations

682
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,648
Was sind almost sixty years ago

683
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,976
A great day this can be in history

684
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,280
Out of all the arguments

685
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,072
Different points of view

686
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,632
My way was found to agree

687
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:03,008
Truman is speaking to the delegates who would sign the UN Charter in the War Memorial Opera House

688
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,312
Six blocks away from the present day

689
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,848
United Nations Plaza

690
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
It was the result

691
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:14,784
August Spirit of give-and-take of tolerance for the views and interests of others

692
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,088
Those problems and scores of others

693
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,184
Which winterize are all difficult they're complicated

694
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,256
They are controversial and dangerous

695
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,560
If we keep to our principles

696
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:31,424
And never forsake our objectives the problems we now face

697
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,496
And those to come will also be song

698
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:53,440
That was the biography of a hundred thousand square feet bruised by Ben tension in 2004

699
00:30:54,464 --> 00:31:00,608
I'm recording this on November 17th 2011 and I was down at UN Plaza today recording the fountain

700
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
Pictures

701
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
Yard Market was being set up

702
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,752
And the water was flowing in the fountain that was

703
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,080
Marred by a bit of trash circling the Eddie's butt

704
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,896
Nothing too grotesque are expected

705
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:16,480
Yellow chain that cordoned off the fountain 2004 is gone

706
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,552
And this morning with the Art Market being set up I got

707
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,880
How much stronger feel for the intention of the Plaza

708
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,416
And was evident

709
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,952
It was at its worst

710
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,536
But the big issues were still plain to see

711
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:35,168
Landscape architect Lawrence Halprin who designed UN Plaza and is featured in the piece

712
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
Has since died

713
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:41,824
It is your first exposure to help and I really recommend you look them up and check out his other work

714
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:46,688
He is absolutely revered in matcha landscape architecture community

715
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,528
And the Very principles of interactivity and engagement

716
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,552
That works

717
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,112
To the detriment of UN Plaza

718
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
You'll did

719
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,928
Stunningly successful result

720
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,256
And other places so it's worth exploring more of his legacy

721
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,792
If you're into that sort of thing

722
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,328
Which I think you are

723
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,424
Because you just listen to a half-hour documentary about the failure of a public space

724
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
You're a big old nerd

725
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
Like me

726
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
God love you

727
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,624
This episode of 99% invisible

Who was produced by Ben Thompson

729
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,720
Any possible with support from lunar

730
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:37,376
Making a difference with creativity it's a project of kalw local public radio 91.7 in

731

San Francisco

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

737
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,104
The body genius is a dark

738
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
Comic mystery

739
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,456
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

740
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,992
We're looking the part

741
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
Might cost you your life

742
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:31,904
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

743
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,256
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

744
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:40,608
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

745
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,960
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

746
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:49,312
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

747
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:55,712
I think a few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action

748
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,992
Movie called Immortal cop

749
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:03,392
Was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

750
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:09,792
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it now I need to

751
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
To clear my name

752
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:17,472
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

753
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:26,432
