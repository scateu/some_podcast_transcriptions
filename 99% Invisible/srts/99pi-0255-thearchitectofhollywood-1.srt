Picture for a minute

33
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
Los Angeles

34
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
The Grand Marquis downtown

35
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,560
The Spanish style mansions in the Hills

36
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,120
The Jetsons like diners and Drive-In

37
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,448
Los Angeles is an architectural potpourri

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,032
It's a kind of place where if you want to go and build a house that looks like a Dutch

39
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
Colonial

40
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,104
Or a mansion with Doric columns

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
Square sleep modernist flat roof thing

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
That's fine

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
Anything Goes

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
That savory truffles

45
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:01,088
In Los Angeles architecture late there are no rules

46
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
No unifying Style

47
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,744
Because her people flocking to Hollywood in the 1930s 40s and 50s

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,608
The growing city gave them an opportunity to build whatever kind of house they wanted

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,448
French Chateau futuristic modern Italian Villa whatever

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,520
And there's this one particular architect

51
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
You can do it all

52
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
Do it well

53
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,616
And his name

54
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
Was Paul Revere

55
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
Williams

56
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,832
Paul Williams contribution to American architecture can be described in the number differ

57
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
This is architect

58
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
Phil freelon

59
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,440
It was a incredibly gifted

60
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232
A residential designer

61
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
And on the West Coast

62
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
Quickly in Los Angeles

63
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,888
He was known for Designing residences

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,704
Of a number of Hollywood stars

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,032
Paul Williams design Frank Sinatra's bachelor pad

66
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,592
A mansion for Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz

67
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,432
You made additions on the Beverly Hills Hotel in the Palm Springs Tennis Club

68
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,504
He also helped design the stately and sparse

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
LA County Courthouse

70
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
Have you ever flown into LAX

71
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,160
You can see this really space-age you looking structure

72
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,232
Looks like a flying saucer with long legs

73
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
That landed in front of Terminal 1

74
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,072
That's called the theme building

75
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
And Paul Williams was part of the team that made that

76
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
And the sheer volume of this work he produced over 3,000 projects in his career in his 50-year career

77
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
And that's

78
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
That's quite

79
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
Achievement

80
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,688
No one is exactly sure how many built

81
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,992
It's certainly in the thousands

82
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
But still

83
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
He was largely invisible figure

84
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
Architectural history

85
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
As well as Los Angeles

86
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
This history

87
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
He designed everything from mentions luxury hotels and car dealerships to hospitals housing

88
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
Republic schools

89
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,960
In addition to the variety of Williams commissions he could work in a huge variety of styles

90
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,776
Seriously if you pick two of his buildings at random

91
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
In most cases

92
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,848
You never know that the same Market

93
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
Text made them both

94
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
So you really didn't have

95
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,968
A particular signature move or

96
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
For more material usage

97
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,600
That you can drive up and say that's a Paul Williams building

98
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,184
But if you look at the body of work there is a level of

99
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
Excellence in

100
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:19,839
A consistency in the quality of the work not in this early in a in a stylist

101
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,447
He is the architect who helped make the multi Style

102
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Style

103
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
Of Los Angeles

104
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
And Los Angeles intern

105
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
Helped make him

106
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,407
In Los Angeles Paul Williams was able to build a career for himself

107
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
30 probably couldn't have had anywhere else

108
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
South America

109
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
As an African-American Oregon

110
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
Poems

111
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
African American architect

112
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,487
Who is much more than an African-American architect

113
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
Simply one of the best

114
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,119
20th century this is Karen Hudson

115
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
Paul Williams biography

116
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
And also is granddaughter

117
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,263
As we're closer micro blackway

118
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:04,127
Hudson says the Los Angeles her grandfather grew up in back in the early 1900s

119
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,431
Was pretty different from what it is now

120
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
Community Open Spaces

121
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
He was born

122
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,527
Downtown

123
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
8th and Santee

124
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903
Your downtown was a heart of La in 1894

125
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,559
And in 1894 when Williams was born Los Angeles was pretty much a small downtown surrounded with

126
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,119
Beanfields in Orange Groves and the wild Pacific

127
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
In the population of LA was skyrocketing

128
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:33,055
From 1890 to 1900 the city doubled from 50000 to 100,000 residents

129
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
In just 10 years

130
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,943
The growing city was full of people that had come West for a better life

131
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
Paul Williams as parents were from Memphis

132
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,831
And had moved to Los Angeles just before he was born

133
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
They came to California for their health

134
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Because they both

135
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
Had tuberculosis

136
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
And that's how he was orphaned before he was 4

137
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
Williams was raised by foster parents

138
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,191
Get a brother who is 9 years older than him who was raised in a different family

139
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
And died at a young age of pneumonia

140
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
That much of a family of his own

141
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
William spent a lot of time in the neighborhood

142
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
Downtown LA

143
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,943
Which is full of immigrants from all over the world

144
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,247
I mean he talks about

145
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Learning

146
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
Conservation in

147
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,159
Gardena things for the Japanese kids in the neighborhood and

148
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
Cesar suck down that up

149
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:27,839
In this diverse group of kids all went to school together even though Paul Williams remembers being the only black head

150
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,143
There were no segregated schools in LA

151
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
Blackheads

152
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,031
But the ones I go get it this would be instrumental later in life

153
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,335
When his High School connections would prove

154
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,871
Very valuable

155
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
And Paul Williams is career

156
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,735
It's hard to say exactly where Williams desire to be an architect

157
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Came from

158
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
He did have a natural talent for drawing

159
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
And then

160
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,159
Somehow he learns that architecture was a profession

161
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,975
And then resolutely decided it was for him

162
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279
What is kind of incredible when you think about it

163
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
He never knew another architect never relieved

164
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
Heart of another rock

165
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,239
When Williams told his high school guidance counselor that he wanted to practice architecture

166
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,031
He was told to give it up

167
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,431
He should not try to be an architect he should be a doctor or a lawyer because black people always need doctors and lawyer

168
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
And why people would not hire him as an architect in black people can afford them so

169
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,623
So he should just give up

170
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,439
Didn't happen

171
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,743
Williams didn't go to architecture school

172
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:34,143
Instead he attended different art schools and engineering school just cobbling together the skills he needed in draft

173
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
Landscaping materials

174
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:40,287
Before he was certified as a contractor in 1915

175
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,359
And then came the challenge of actually getting hired

176
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
His own notes he said he got

177
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
Dressed in his best suit and

178
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,807
I wish you're probably only had one for church but

179
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
Best suit Hazel briefcase

180
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
Wood knocking on doors

181
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,231
He approached all the architects in the area that he admired

182
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023
And show them his portfolio

183
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
They all

184
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
Said no but they smile when they said no

185
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
Then he went back the next day

186
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
And kept knocking

187
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,847
I finally got two offers one for $3 a week maybe five and one for nothing

188
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
But he took the job that was for nothing because he thought you would learn more and being a better person

189
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,951
Paul Williams work for landscape architect residential architect and a commercial

190
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,047
Attack before he was licensed to practice in California in 1921

191
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
The following year he started his own firm

192
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Paul R Williams

193
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
And Associates

194
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
Williams's first

195
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Solo Commission

196
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,775
Was a house for a well-connected high school friend

197
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,127
And is neighborhoods in Los Angeles blossomed word about William spread

198
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,199
In a 2003 thirties if you go to dinner at somebody's house

199
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,527
Do they have a new house as if we drive Jacksonville has one more one more one more

200
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,343
Williams had an impeccable sense of scale

201
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:01,695
And he knew just how to situate a structure on a property to make best use

202
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
Beautiful views in sunlight

203
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,559
He helped create what would come to be known

204
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
As the Hollywood style

205
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:13,471
That opulent mixture of Mediterranean European and Colonial influences

206
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,287
With swimming pools and sweeping staircases

207
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,103
It's a rich and Sumptuous Sensibility

208
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,943
The pole Williams kept these Mansions very clean and classy

209
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,015
Paul R Williams & Associates group quickly

210
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
And became renowned

211
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,415
Although some clients would be taken aback when they met with

212
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
Because you know they may have read about him

213
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
Anime of heard about him but they didn't realize

214
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
He didn't want people to be uncomfortable

215
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
And often they were

216
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,935
I mean one thing

217
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
The hire somebody it's one thing

218
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,335
To think that he's the best around you want the best around it's another thing.

219
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,199
Many of his white client had never interacted with a black professional Buffet

220
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,807
Williams had to find ways to work around white people discomfort with

221
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,135
He would not put people in a position where they felt like they had to shake his head

222
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,487
So you would put his hands in his pockets or behind his back

223
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:12,095
And Williams also recognized that many clients wouldn't want to take a seat next

224
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
And

225
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,447
So to make them feel comfortable and to

226
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,775
Possibly persuade people who aren't sure

227
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
About having this black man

228
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,359
He gets in a one-sided sqb on the other side

229
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
And he would ask you

230
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Yo

231
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,527
Do you want a formal living room do you want a formal dining room do you want to

232
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,831
Add an because you have little kids

233
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
Do you want this to want that

234
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
And then

235
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
Facing the client opposite the table

236
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,999
Paul Williams with sketch out of vision of the house

237
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
Upside down

238
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
So that it faced the client

239
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,631
And he was sketching upside down and come alive

240
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Before your eyes

241
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
I said I never interviewed anyone who saw him do it

242
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,263
Who did not just light up

243
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
You should have stayed a

244
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:00,479
You've heard the expression Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did except backwards and in high heels

245
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
Bill polian

246
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
Did everything is white peers.

247
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
Except upside down

248
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
And better

249
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,719
Williams was not the first architect

250
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Draw upside down

251
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,095
But it's indicative of the lengths he went to accommodate his white client

252
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
He always dressed impeccably

253
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
And worked

254
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
Tirelessly

255
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
He wants word about a meeting with a potential client who warned Williams that he was also speaking with a number of Other Ark

256
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,455
The potential client as how soon Williams could submit preliminary drawings

257
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,247
For tomorrow afternoon

258
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Set volume

259
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,391
The client thought it was impossible because all the other Architects had asked for two or three weeks

260
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:44,511
And you can bet that yes Paul Williams delivered that planet for the next day as promised

261
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
They didn't tell the client that a work

262
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,631
22 hours straight without eating or sleeping

263
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
He felt like he had to be light years

264
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
Better just to be accepted

265
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,543
And you know if he wasn't accepted

266
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,895
Sometimes Williams was unwelcome in the very places

267
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,735
He was designing and even after he earned the respect of his client

268
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,831
Kid to tolerate mistreatment from subcontractors and Painters and plumbers

269
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
Can you hire him

270
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Do your home

271
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
And then

272
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Some of the sub people

273
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
For working on a Hummer like

274
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
Taking orders with black guy

275
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
Is a regular kind of thing

276
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Throughout his career

277
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,727
Even as he designed mansions for wealthy clients

278
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,287
Williams also designed affordable homes

279
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
From middle-class angelinos

280
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,431
Republic books of inexpensive construction patterns that anyone could use

281
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
To Build A Home of Their Own

282
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,783
You could send them for $10 and get floor plan for your house

283
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:45,951
Williams also worked on a number of projects specifically for black institutions including buildings on Howard University

284
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
Duke campus in DC

285
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
And the 28th Street YMCA

286
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,863
Which is in a historically black neighborhood in LA

287
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,679
20th Street why was very important to him

288
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
He put in the facade

289
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,567
Likenesses of Frederick Douglass and Booker T Washington

290
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
People leave

291
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,455
Thaddeus young black boys could see that Excellence every day as they walked in or make

292
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Kind of person

293
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
He did a lot of charitable work

294
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
He

295
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:16,159
Did lots of things for children and not just an African American

296
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,231
What he designed st. Jude's Research Hospital in Memphis

297
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
He did it completely

298
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Free of charge

299
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,399
And he simply was one of the most prolific architects of his time

300
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
Of any race

301
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,751
Keep produce thousands of projects in his 50-year career

302
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
He died in 1980

303
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,127
And his funeral was held in a church of his own design

304
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
Toulouse France

305
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Family

306
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Impact client

307
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,319
Paul R Williams & Associates

308
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
Continued working without him

309
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
For a while

310
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,439
Well after he died in 1980

311
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,303
The office went on for a couple of years I'm not quite sure how long it but it

312
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:59,423
Essentially came to an end sometime by the end of the 80s

313
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,239
This is Leslie leavers of the University of Memphis

314
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
And then all of the material

315
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
From his

316
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:10,175
Practice was stored at a branch of the Broadway Federal Savings Bank

317
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,479
And this Branch was a building Williams design

318
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:17,343
He designed it but the more important thing was that one of his daughters

319
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
Marriage the founder of Broadway

320
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,975
Federal so it was essentially a family

321
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
Relationship

322
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,607
And most of Williams documents and records were just there in the bank

323
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
Stored in a room

324
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
They weren't even in a vault

325
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,823
But then in 1992 after a group of officers were acquitted of the brutal beating of Rodney King

326
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
The city of La

327
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
Fit into violent protests

328
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
That branch of Broadway

329
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,039
Federal burn to the ground and everything in it burn to the ground and that was

330
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,879
Pretty much the end of everything available about Paul Williams

331
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,463
This is where the Paul Williams project comes in

332
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Nicole Williams

333
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Project is

334
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,583
Primarily a research project that seeks

335
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,399
Text to accumulate information photograph

336
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Etc about

337
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,495
Paul Williams Pennsylvania his career

338
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,823
And a big part of this project was actually collecting information

339
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,151
And hunting down which buildings were designed by Williams

340
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,223
The project which is based at the University of Memphis

341
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
Send a photographic team to Los Angeles

342
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Palm Springs

343
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
In Las Vegas

344
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
To start a catalog

345
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Paul Williams building

346
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
But they were not always easy to find

347
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:30,047
Because he was a master at. Style

348
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
So

349
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
He would have

350
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
A

351
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
Spanish style house next door

352
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,727
Volume style house next to a

353
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
French

354
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,335
Provincial style house or gothic style

355
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
Okay

356
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,943
The project has found less than half of Williams were

357
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
Who knows how many of his buildings have been unknowingly torn down or renovated beyond recognition

358
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:59,231
And the poems project is always hearing about more buildings to add to the catalog

359
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,535
Mostly in Los Angeles but not exclusively

360
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,351
Williams buildings are all over the country

361
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,423
And there are few were brought we discovered them all the time

362
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,007
And then we verify we verify every house

363
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,799
So we go to the

364
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
City documents

365
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
When pulling permits

366
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
All of that

367
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,711
They are constantly checking and correcting themselves

368
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:25,599
But it's really tough word because they have to go buy accounts and Records which were mostly burned and then

369
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,927
You know Williams of style is just all over the place

370
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:32,511
He just didn't stick the one thing he was always learning and developing

371
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
And

372
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,839
Of course you would listen to his clients

373
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
Trying to respond to

374
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,655
What they needed

375
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
And what their desires were

376
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
That's architect Phil freelon again

377
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
And I asked him

378
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,335
If Williams had to be responsive to his clients

379
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
Flexible in his style

380
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,663
In order to survive the black market

381
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,343
I think that Paul Williams desire to satisfy his clients is something that many Architects chair

382
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
It's not necessarily

383
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
Tied to race

384
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
Although I will point out that

385
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
He had

386
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
To make

387
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
Certain adjustments in his

388
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
Approach to clients

389
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
Because of who he was and

390
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
The time. In which

391
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
She practice

392
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,263
By the way I feel free line is also a big deal

393
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:21,919
You worked on the Museum of African diaspora in San Francisco the center for civil and human rights in Atlanta and moose

394
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:26,015
Most recently national museum of African American history and culture

395
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
On the mall in Washington

396
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,879
Where I was the architect of record

397
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,695
To Fremont had already gotten into an architecture program

398
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,231
And before he had even heard

399
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Paul Williams

400
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,351
How's baby into my third and fourth year of school before I learned about

401
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Paul Williams

402
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
And that was really on my own

403
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
It wasn't anything

404
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,799
In the curriculum are in architectural history that mention him

405
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
Let's make this clear

406
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:54,175
There are a lot of black architects who get left out of the textbook

407
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,247
Paul Williams was not the first black architect in America

408
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,087
But he was the first to be accepted as a member of the AIA

409
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,135
American Institute of Architects

410
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,207
The American Institute of Architects is the

411
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,255
Leading Professional Organization

412
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
The US

413
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
Relations.

414
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
Saxon and others

415
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
In the profession

416
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,935
Paul Williams join the AIA in 1923

417
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
And every black architect I know

418
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
I know who Paul Williams

419
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
And

420
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
Haven't met a wife

421
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
Architecture

422
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,919
Knew who I was talking about if I were to mention that name

423
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
Can we need to change that

424
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:36,159
And this is why Phil freelon nominated Paul Williams for the AIA highest individual award

425
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
The gold medal

426
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,255
It's basically the award that welcomes an architect

427
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
Into the Canon of all-time great

428
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,607
Previous winners include Frank Lloyd Wright

429
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
Mies van der rohe

430
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
Bugaboo CA

431
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
Thomas Jefferson

432
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
And now

433
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,519
Paul Williams will officially join their ranks

434
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
37 years after his death

435
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,639
This award means a lot to freelon

436
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,687
And other African American architects

437
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:03,039
In terms of General visibility a few African American architects

438
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
Working in this country

439
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
Relatively speaking

440
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,415
Go 2% of licensed architects

441
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,695
Does country or black

442
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
And one of the ways you

443
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,327
Would want to combat that is to raise the visibility into

444
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
Make sure people know

445
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,959
Great profession in the young people see it has a

446
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,495
That's a possibility

447
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
And as an option

448
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
For them

449
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,383
And ultimately this award is about recognizing a master

450
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,943
A recognition that is long overdue

451
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,855
Paul Williams develop The Eclectic style of the California home and helped shape the look and feel of Asia

452
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,159
Just as much as Los Angeles

453
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Shaved him

454
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,279

Between the beats

Bongs and chatter of our devices

474
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,839
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

475
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:57,471
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

476
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:03,359

477
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151

Okay

487
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:32,544
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

488
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,360
Makes for a much more natural experience

489
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,408
Turn the living room lights on

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

522
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,256
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

523
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,584
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

524
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,608

527
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,312
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that

528
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:48,736
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called immortal

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse

532
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
