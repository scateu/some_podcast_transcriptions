I'm Roman Mars

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,744
There's this Photograph back on the wall here in the studio

32
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,584
The photo shows three men wearing bowler hats

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
Two of them and bowties

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,704
I'm looking dead on into the camera with this casual look

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
Of Conquest

36
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
Please raise

37
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:53,920
Hands on hips to spend admitere on the lifted arm of a giant dredging machine machine

38
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,272
Use the force the natural environment to bend to the will of humans

39
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,832
Even if you don't know this image in particular

40
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
Keep seeing images like it

41
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,696
Teams of people standing around probably looking good

42
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,488
As they shape the Earth

43
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:12,352
What fascinates me about the pictures from this time is that they speak to this moment

44
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,168
When was a real sense of awe and reverence

45
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,216
For the marvels of civil engineering

46
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,776
Now I don't mean to Oprah romanticize this stuff

47
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:25,664
A lot of things we did for the sake of progress or ethically dubious if not outright horrible

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
They were mountains tunnel Hills flatten

49
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
Swamp strain

50
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:36,416
But the environmental impact notwithstanding these Feats of engineering work. Amazing for their time there

51
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
Amazing for our time

52
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,328
The photo I'm talking about the three guys in bowler hats on the dredging machine

53
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,144
Is a scene from The Rubber Soul on the Chicago River

54
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448
And the reason that photo is famous

55
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,496
Are these famous enough for me but I've seen it

56
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,312
Is because the reversal of the Chicago River

57
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,128
Was an enormous engineering project that was

58
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,408
Successful

59
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,856
But you got to figure there were countless other photographs depicting similarly awe-inspiring Feats of engineering prowess

60
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
That we have never seen

61
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
Because those feeds

62
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
Never got finished

63
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
They were you can say

64
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
Failures

65
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,376
Today with the story of one such failure which

66
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
4 people finally gave up on it

67
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,240
Probably also wants included a moment

68
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
A man

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
Posing

70
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
Machinery

71
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,384
So actually I do have a photo we can start from

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
Fated to 1890

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,016
Reporter Julia Barton grew up in Dallas Texas

74
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
Broadway takes place

75
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
These men

76
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
A few of them in bowler hats

77
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
Are standing on a wide flat boat

78
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
With a winch

79
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,048
A chain and hook dangle down from the winch and they're holding up a

80
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
Tree stump

81
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,144
Boats in a narrow muddy river and it's surrounded by

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,984
Huge piles of broken up trees and other debris floating in the water

83
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
The boat's name

84
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
Snagboat Dallas

85
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,128
Dallas man I love that name

86
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
Growing up in Dallas

87
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
I never saw a pic

88
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
Pictures of things like the snagboat Dallas of Dallas

89
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
I never heard of the failed project

90
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,624
Generations of Dallas people spent their lives pursuing

91
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
Even though it concerns an engineering project

92
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
So massive

93
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
But it was once compared to

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,536
Do both the Panama Canal

95
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,583
And the Great Pyramids of Giza

96
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
This is the story

97
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
Deport

98
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Of Dallas

99
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,103
If you know anything about Texas geography

100
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,663
You probably at least know that Dallas is not

101
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Close to the ocean

102
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
At all

103
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,759
It's more than 300 miles

104
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
To the Gulf of Mex

105
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:45,439
That's like trying to build a port to the Pacific Ocean in Reno Nevada report to the Atlantic and Eastern Tennessee

106
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,767
But unlike Reno or Eastern Tennessee Dallas is at least

107
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
Located on the river that flows to the ocean

108
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
The trinity

109
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
In Dallas though the Trinity is really low

110
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
And very narrow

111
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,591
So narrow that there are stories of Dallas's first ferry boat on the Trinity turning itself sideways to act as a bridge

112
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
From time to time

113
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,431
So the Trinity was not a great way to move

114
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
People are Farm crops to

115
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,015
But neither was the alternative

116
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:15,391
In the early days of Dallas in the 1840s and 1850s getting mood on a boat

117
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,975
They were in the back of a wagon getting pulled by a team of oxen

118
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,791
Railroad came to Dallas in 1872

119
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:26,143
The railroad companies could and did raise their rates whenever they felt like it

120
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,263
Dallas leaders wanted River navigation to keep access to the outside world

121
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
Affordable

122
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,335
But in addition to being low and narrow

123
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,663
The Trinity River is incredibly long and winding

124
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,503
Even though Dallas is about 300 miles to the ocean

125
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Crow flies

126
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
With all the trinities Meandering

127
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
It's closer to 700 miles River

128
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,207
The few boats that made it to Dallas from the Gulf

129
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
Nearly a year doing it

130
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
One of them was the aforementioned

131
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,071
Snag boat Dallas

132
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Dallas

133
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
Which clear debris called snags out of the water

134
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
To make a river navigable

135
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
Steamship

136
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,287
One of the first of those was the steamboat Har-Ber

137
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,919
When the AHA Harvey Jr finally made it to Dallas in 1893

138
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
The city went

139
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
Nuts

140
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
There was a massive

141
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
The parade the local paper printed it

142
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
It's front page

143
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
In red

144
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,391
It was a huge day and they declared

145
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
Dallas had become a Port City

146
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,511
Is resolved that leaving the city directories

147
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,607
Like a 19-1 city directory just got describes Dallas as a Port City

148
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
That's Dallas historian Darwin Payne

149
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,263
In the dynamic he's describing here in the city directory is very important

150
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Dallas

151
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
There's the actual version of events

152
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
And then there's this

153
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
Grossly optimistic

154
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
Make version

155
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,479
And as I was researching the story

156
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
This kind of

157
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,295
Roostery salesman voice

158
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
Kept coming at me in different forms

159
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
Telling me that something that way

160
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Absolutely

161
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Untrue

162
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
Absolutely was true

163
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,863
We had Dallas Warren actor William Jackson Harper boy's various clippings from the written record of the 103

164
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,167
30 year old history of the Trinity project

165
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,519
Curious as the Dallas Times-Herald in 1893

166
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Interesting

167
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,103
The navigation of the Trinity is not

168
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,407
A possibility it is an accomplished

169
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
Yeah BHA Harvey made it

170
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
But that's just one boat

171
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
For more books to follow

172
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,087
The river would have to become easier to

173
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,927
Remember this is the era of getting done

174
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
We got to move the River Vine let's move the river

175
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,119
Dallas convinced Congress to survey the river and figure out where locks and dams could help make it navigable

176
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,775
The Army Corps of Engineers finished the First Lock and Dam in the early nineteen hundreds at a site 13 miles below Dallas

177
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
But eventually Congress shelter

178
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151
The locks and dams that had already been built

179
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Mouldered

180
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
Locks

181
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Damn

182
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Along the river

183
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
Stood deserted

184
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
Moss-covered

185
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,391
And just as it had done before the white man came to text

186
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Did an Empire

187
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
Wilderness

188
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
Trinity River

189
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Muddy

190
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
Unclean

191
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Turtle Inn

192
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Festival

193
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
Wound sluggishly

194
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
23isBack

195
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,519
But then the port of Dallas caught a second wind

196
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
The Trinity may have been

197
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Turtle infested

198
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
But it wasn't always plug

199
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
In 1908

200
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
The River flooded

201
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
And it made a mess

202
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
Dallas

203
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
It turned downtown Dallas into

204
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,831
Peninsula surrounded by raging flood

205
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
It devastated the city

206
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
And as result of that

207
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Dallas

208
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,327
Are George Kester to created what was known as the tests were playing

209
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
Kessler was a famous urban planner

210
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
European trained but

211
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
Spent part of his youth in Dallas

212
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,287
He created a vision for the city that included Boulevard

213
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Parks

214
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,127
But the part that really excited Dallas leaders

215
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
Is how Kessler reimagined

216
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Mandarin

217
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
He envisioned it

218
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,807
Becoming a straight Channel about a half-mile West

219
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
Existing course through Dallas

220
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Levies

221
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Pain the new channel

222
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
And open up miles of flubbed

223
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
Development

224
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Right neck

225
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Downtown

226
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,583
Basically they moved the river out of downtown

227
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,983
Even if you do know the geography of Dallas it's hard to picture exactly what this means the project was even bigger than

228
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:19,103
Then you would think cuz it involved changes in the road roadways going over

229
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
The

230
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,479
Sewer systems in in utility connection

231
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,063
And a huge Earth moving project course

232
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,463
Supposed to say this was the kind of enormous project where there be pictures of giant machines Top by men in bowler hats

233
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,255
1928

234
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
So fedoras would have been more in style

235
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,703
And so starting in 1928 The River moving project was a go the city of Dallas Doug Trinity I-20

236
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
6 Mile straight shot Channel

237
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,823
With tall Levi is on either side of an 1/2 Mile apart

238
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,151
Perfect for the commercial barges than Our Place Steamboat

239
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
And make no mistake

240
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,527
Historical record shows that even though this massive project was on its face

241
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
About flood control

242
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
Dallas leaders at the time

243
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
Saw this at the resurrection

244
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
The port of Dallas

245
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
So in 1930

246
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,767
You got another ceremony for the port of Dallas

247
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,423
A bottle containing the Sweet Sweet Waters of the Gulf of Mexico the final destination of the Trinity River

248
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
Smashed over a dredging machine

249
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
As people cheered on

250
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
A local Pastor gave the Benedict

251
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,383
Vision

252
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,943
See the coming Millions

253
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,039
When are virgin acres are up turn to the smiles of

254
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
Resources developed

255
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
Show people

256
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,023
They really like to lay it on thick I'm going to stay

257
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,303
And from there

258
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
The plan to build a port of Dallas

259
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Was really

260
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Underway

261
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,471
There was a general will for it there was political clout

262
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Behind it

263
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
And it was eventually money to fund it

264
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
The Army Corps of Engineers came up

265
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
With a really big

266
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
Plan

267
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
To change the whole course of the trinity

268
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Palau boat

269
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Dallas

270
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
And even further Upstream to Fort Worth

271
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:09,695
President John F Kennedy just a month before he was assassinated in Dallas signed off on a huge 900

272
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,999
Billion dollar spending package for the trinity

273
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
And despite the

274
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
PR nightmare that

275
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Rafael Dallas

276
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
JFK's death

277
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
The river play

278
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
Plan kept on moving forward

279
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,239
After all the new President Lyndon B Johnson

280
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
Was a Texan

281
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
And he was a favorite

282
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
The project

283
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,359
Give me is talking on the phone in 90s

284
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,663
68 with Fort Worth Congressman Jim Wright

285
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
Okay honey

286
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:40,159
I had a long hard week but a good run I think we got your things

287
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,743
I think we all know we're working on

288
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:50,143
I guess that'll be the major cronyism of the camp

289
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,935
The rest of us

290
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,239
Dallas was ready

291
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,639
In anticipation of the soon-to-be navigable Trinity River bridges constructed over the river

292
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,479
Extra tall throughout seagoing vessels clearance

293
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Underneath

294
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,599
Most bridges are constructed 15 to 20 feet of existing Terrain

295
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
Wellies do high-rise Viaduct

296
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
Rise to well over 60 ft

297
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,559
One reason is so they may handle the hook for and sought-after Barge traffic

298
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:22,143
Xfinity performance claim will pour into the Dallas-Fort Worth area

299
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,727
It's been a hundred and thirty years

300
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:31,103
That's about 115 years longer than it took to build the Great Pyramid of Giza

301
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:37,759
Dallas is finally becoming a port city think of what this means

302
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807
Riverboat gambling cruises

303
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Heavy industry

304
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
Loading dock

305
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Fisherman

306
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
Longshoreman

307
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Stevedores

308
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
Romantic picnics on the Levee

309
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,535
But then the port of Dallas in his neck

310
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
So to speak

311
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
It went out not with a bang

312
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
But with the wine of a jet turbine engine

313
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,103
The great irony is that while all of this was taking place in the early 1970s Dallas and Fort Worth were bill

314
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,639
Burlington International Airport

315
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
Ramp transition is

316
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Film producer

317
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
Who made a documentary about the trinity

318
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
For Dallas is public.

319
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
TV station

320
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
Kera

321
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
He says

322
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,415
The massive DFW Airport invigorated

323
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
The newest

324
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Regrowing hair

325
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
Dallas was deindustrializing

326
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
The city of mood from its reliance

327
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
Agriculture

328
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
Trade

329
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
2 technology

330
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
Light manufacturer

331
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Banking

332
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
Insurance

333
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
Companies like Ted

334
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
Texas Instruments

335
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
On the rise

336
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
They didn't need

337
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
Barges to reach the outside world

338
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
They had an airport

339
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
Am I considered judgment

340
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,479
The panel station to Riverwoods

341
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:45,599
Probably make Dallas feel the way of the other four cities with the flu to channel which Houston I asked

342
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,927
Increase crime and increase during a deterioration of the inner city

343
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,023
Alan Steelman who ran for congress in Dallas in 1970s

344
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,815
He ran against the

345
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,031
You're not locating in Dallas

346
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
And he won

347
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:10,687
Soon after that voters rejected a referendum to spend their tax dollars on the canal

348
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
So right when the dream of those men aboard the snagboat Dallas of Dallas was finally on the cuss

349
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Reality

350
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
The dream was that

351
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,463
Dallas would not become a Port City

352
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
Which is really a shame

353
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
Navigate Dallas need to be Airport

354
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,143
But because they totally messed up the natural landscape of the city

355
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,703
Remember that the port of Dallas project

356
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
Eventually included The Kessler plan

357
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:40,127
But you literally move the river and channeled it into a man make now outside of town

358
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,199
The Trinity River used to meander through the center of Dallas

359
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,527
It's hard as I can guess the civil engineering needs of the time I mean

360
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
River did flood the city pretty regularly

361
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,391
But one can't help but think

362
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,975
Did this could have been a nice Riverfront for people to stroll along

363
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,791
A beloved piece of nature in the middle of the city

364
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
The board of Dallas not only failed

365
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,655
Stole the natural Riverfront

366
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
From the people of Dallas

367
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
Like a lot of people of my generation groin

368
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
Map of the 70s and 80s

369
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,591
I didn't really know there was a river in Dallas at all

370
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
You can

371
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
Kind of see the Trinity River in the

372
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
Title sequence of the

373
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Tv show Dallas

374
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,271
Which launched in 1978

375
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,319
Put the camera mostly lingers on the

376
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Skyscrapers

377
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,183
In real life you might catch a glimpse of the River Forest

378
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Split Second

379
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,023
If you look down from one of those High freeway Bridges

380
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
More often

381
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
You'd smell them

382
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
A lot of Dallas

383
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
Does untreated sewage.

384
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
In the 70s

385
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
There were

386
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
After a hard rain in in Dallas

387
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
Thing that called the black rice

388
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
Wood Royal Downstream and

389
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Kill everything in

390
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,711
The toxic sludge wasn't

391
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
The worst

392
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
In the river

393
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
I'm talking about

394
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
Dead body

395
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
The Trinity River Bottom wisdom

396
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
Place where you tie the Eva

397
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
Sketchy and unlit

398
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
It was so dark

399
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
Set If you flew into Dallas at night

400
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
You could pick up

401
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
The floodway B

402
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,375
It was completely invisible

403
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,447
This dark artery flow through the heart

404
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
You would never think of going

405
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
Never

406
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
But of course Julia now had to go there

407
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,759
She got in a canoe that's called the snack new Dallas or Dallas

408
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
Easy the snagit

409
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,599
12 are you going to go to the right or the left

410
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,463
Trinity River resumed its natural winding course South of downtown Dallas

411
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
It flows through a dense hardwood forest

412
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:39,679
This part of the river bottom was left alone for decades because the plan was to someday bulldoze all this into a big turning

413
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,727
Basin in loading area for barges

414
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,383
Now the Audubon Society has built a center at the edge of the forest and it leads canoe and kayak rides for

415
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
Urban River floors

416
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Not

417
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
The suburbs

418
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,879
So you got 26 mile of river diverted

419
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:04,511
Into a walled-off artificial Channel plus another long stretch shielded by dense forest

420
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:10,911
Making that easily accessible for public use is the huge urban planning challenge the Dallas now has thickened

421
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Done with

422
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:18,079
Good news is that the people now realize that this man made and man neglected landscape is the river they have

423
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,919
And that's better than pretending that they have no River at all

424
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
It's a strange place

425
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,759
Not exactly comfortable

426
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
But not the nightmare of my choice

427
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
Childhood imagination either

428
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
It's a landscape

429
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
Stuck in it

430
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
Patient of something

431
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
That never have

432
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:41,631
In the course of history there are plenty of undertakings just as unlikely that the board of Dallas

433
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,959
We just don't think of the reversal of the Chicago River or

434
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
To the Panama Canal

435
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:51,103
As polysorb forget about them entirely because Against All Odds

436
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
They succeeded

437
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,735
And they were crowned with much hat-wearing and machine posing

438
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,295
But when an engineering Endeavor fails

439
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,367
Sometimes all we get our scars in the landscape

440
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
If we're lucky

441
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
We get to try again

442
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,719
Make something good out of it

443
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Like a park

444
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
Hopefully with a plaque

445
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:18,751
I'd like it if they put up a black

446
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,247
99% invisible was produced this week by Julia Barton

We are project 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco and produced out of the offices of Art

449
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,327
An Architecture Firm in the beautiful downtown Port of Oakland

450
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:51,519
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sand

451
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:57,407
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

452
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:02,783
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is in another room and we're all hearing.

453
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,087
Voice technology talk to us

454
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,391
It is a creation of Sonic trash

455
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,207
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

456
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,791
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

457
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,839
To make them more human

458
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
Turn the living room lights on

459
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Okay

460
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,031
Dim the living room lights to 50%

461
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Okay

462
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:32,479
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

463
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,295
Makes for a much more natural experience

464
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
Turn the living room lights on

465
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Dim the living room lights to 50

466
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,207
