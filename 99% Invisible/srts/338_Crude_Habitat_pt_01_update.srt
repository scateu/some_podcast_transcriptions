This is 99% invisible

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,960
There are a lot of beautiful places in California

25
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,008
Downtown Oakland for example

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
But Santa Barbara

27
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
Is like

28
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
Stupid beautiful

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
Yeah it's like

30
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,200
Economically picturesque California seeing here

31
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,600
A few months back we sent producer Emmett Fitzgerald down to Santa Barbara on a really taxing reporting assignment

32
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,624
Dallas

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,672
Beautiful sailboats

34
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,464
Pelicans

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
Two dolphins

36
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,840
Songs beginning with that

37
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
Through rough life

38
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
Here comes a wave

39
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
F clef

40
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,640
And it really put himself In Harm's Way for the story

41
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,480
But if you look out at the ocean from this Scenic spot

42
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
You'll see something else

43
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Something

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
A little less

45
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,344
Conventionally attractive

46
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,136
Right on the horizon line

47
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
That one too

48
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,488
Three four

49
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,816
567

50
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,912
Big offshore oil platforms

51
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
They look like

52
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,496
Buildings out there floating in the water

53
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,544
Giant battleships or something

54
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,872
The prettiest people here

55
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,152
Don't love them

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
Those oil platforms off Santa Barbara are at the center of a complicated debate going on right now within the environmental community

57
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,024
About the relationship between nature and human infrastructure

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,656
Although they have been a source of controversy since they first went in the water back in the 1950s and 60s

59
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,728
I came to Santa Barbara in 1966

60
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
This is Roderick Nash

61
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,664
Environmental historian who moved to Santa Barbara from New Hampshire to take a job in history department at UCSB

62
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,992
And it didn't take him long to fall in love with his new home

63
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
I began to realize what

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
People have told me they said

65
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,880
Santa Barbara's like the American Riviera

66
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
It's kind of a paradise

67
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,720
The land of Endless Summer

68
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,560
But at the time he says there was a sense that this Coastal Paradise

69
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
Sad lucrative tourist economy

70
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
Was under threat

71
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,168
Massive oil rig

72
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,472
It's going up all throughout the Santa Barbara Channel

73
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
They were cries

74
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
From the people Santa Barbara saying

75
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,896
Not so fast let's let's think about the consequence

76
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,760
We look out at the channel this is the million dollar view this is this is what

77
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
How the economy

78
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
And the culture of Santa Barbara is about

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,136
And now suddenly but pretty

80
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
Offshore oil rig shop

81
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,744
Up there and we're not so sure that we're protected from

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
Spills

83
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,608
But at the time there wasn't a whole lot anyone could do

84
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
EPA didn't exist yet

85
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,728
Dor no major environmental regulations in place

86
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
And so the oil platform

87
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,872
Went in and they operated without any major spills

88
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,968
Until January 28th 1969

89
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
I was working on the

90
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Fourth

91
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,624
Floor of the El Paseo building that Overlook the ocean

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
This is Bud bottoms

93
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
Local artists who actually passed away last year this audio is more video interview the bottoms did a few years back

94
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,935
Back where you describe getting a phone call from a friend who had flown into Santa Barbara earlier that day

95
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
He was flying over the channel this particular day

96
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
They saw a big blowout

97
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
Either there's oil

98
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
From Eddie V

99
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
Platform by crazy

100
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
The whole house. Here is black

101
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
Good morning

102
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
Union oil the owner of the platform in question had failed to build a large enough protective casing for one of its well

103
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,207
Loyal which was under immense pressure

104
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,047
Forced its way around the well and erupted to the ocean floor

105
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,143
1000 gallons of crude were pouring into the ocean every hour

106
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
Rodger Nash heard about the spill that same day

107
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,567
But he said it took a little while for the scale of the disaster to really set in

108
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
I can remember walking down to the beach

109
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
No change

110
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,455
No change and then I walk down to the beach one day

111
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,271
And it was a black tide there was oil

112
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
And

113
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Suddenly

114
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
The postcard

115
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Beaches

116
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Santa Barbara

117
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
We're black

118
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
Crude oil floats on top of water

119
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,351
Until this bill was particularly deadly for Sebring

120
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,655
Birds that dive into the water to catch fish

121
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,727
You go in and your feathers are covered with oil and you can't fly

122
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Can you fly

123
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Shop help

124
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Play on the beach

125
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
It was an apocalyptic

126
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,431
Although Nash has the most uncanny thing may have been the

127
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
Sound

128
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
The waves

129
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
We're very quiet

130
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
Because they were loyal

131
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
They had sort of a mushy sound

132
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
Because what was really breaking was

133
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951
2-3 inches of oil on top of the water

134
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
We stood there and cried

135
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
I hear grown men and women

136
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119
Sitting there crying because the beach was half their life

137
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,191
We thought it was all over for us

138
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
But as

139
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,287
Sad as the 1969 spill was

140
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
Bud bottoms was

141
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Mostly just

142
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Furious

143
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
I got so angry

144
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
I just screamed out

145
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,735
We got to get oil out

146
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,807
Heber call screaming get oil.out at work

147
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
Panda by boss

148
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
The next off and he said

149
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
Hey get oil.out Google

150
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
Good name

151
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,071
And so Google spelled gooo!

152
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,935
Name of a new environmental organization that has helped launch in Santa Barbara

153
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
And whose goal was simple

154
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
Stop all Drilling and eventually

155
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
Ghettos platform

156
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:42,175
Can we do you know it cuz the stopped oil drilling in our in our

157
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,735
Beautiful pristine Nostrand Santa Barbara

158
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
Google held rallies and marches

159
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,111
They organized a human blockade to prevent oil trucks

160
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
Sperm reaching the harbor

161
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,463
And there were more creative forms of protest

162
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,047
We said off bottles of little bottles of oil

163
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
Bar Harbor

164
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
Does every Harry

165
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
Government official there was

166
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,239
II see for themselves what we were dealing with

167
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
The oil spill quickly became an international news

168
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
In part because of the timer

169
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,919
This is the very beginning of the modern environmental move

170
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,271
Rachel Carson's Landmark book Silent Spring it come out to the few years

171
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Before

172
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
The Apollo 8 spacecraft

173
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
What's orbiting the Moon

174
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,159
Sending back photos of the Earth

175
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,231
Looking like a blue green marble in the empty desert

176
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Space

177
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,607
The first time people were beginning to understand that the planet was small

178
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Fragile

179
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,191
And the humans were doing a great deal of damage

180
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239
So all those images

181
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:42,335
Soil drench seabirds dying are beautiful California beaches

182
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
They went around the world

183
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
People looked at these birds

184
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
I thought this is Santa Barbara

185
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,295
The Spill was a galvanizing event for environmentalist

186
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,135
The first anniversary activist rally in Santa Barbara

187
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,439
And some of them went on to organize the first Earth

188
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Saying

189
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,791
This is why we need it this is why we needed

190
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
I'll because of something like the Santa Barbara oil spill

191
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,727
The oil spill inspired Roderick Nash to start one of the country's first

192
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
Environmental Studies program

193
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
UC Santa Barbara

194
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:19,199
It also fueled debate in Congress and help rally support for some of the most important environmental bills in US history

195
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,015
The 1969 National Environmental Policy Act

196
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
Was followed by the Clean Air Act in 1970

197
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
The Clean Water Act in 1972

198
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,951
Any Endangered Species Act in 1973

199
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
Destiny with you

200
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,535
Increasingly as you look back at it

201
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
From now

202
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
50 years

203
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
You look back at it

204
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
You can really say

205
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
Holy cow

206
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
There was a lot of change

207
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
And the Santa Barbara

208
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,567
Oil spill had a lot to do with that change

209
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,407
The Spill catalyze a national movement

210
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,735
But there was still the question of the platforms themselves

211
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,599
Local opposition put a stop to most new oil exploration off California

212
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,183
The existing oil rigs have continued to operate per decade

213
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,791
Today many of those old platforms are reaching the end of their productive lifetime

214
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,351
And based on the original lease agreements

215
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
They should be decommissioned

216
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
And removed from the water

217
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,751
Carla Frisk is on the board of Goo it's

218
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Still around

219
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
And she can't wait for the oil companies to be

220
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Begone

221
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
Get to the interlace and be done

222
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
A Ninja Turtle

223
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
Equipment and go away

224
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
Get oil out

225
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
If you will

226
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
Yeah the name

227
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:32,159
Felt it all really yeah you don't have any doubts about what the organization's about right off the bat

228
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:38,815
Brisk wants the oil companies to return the Santa Barbara channel to the way it was before the platforms went in the water

229
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:43,423
A pristine ocean environment without any giant artificial structures

230
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,031
You go down there and that you would never know that they were there

231
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,079
Really what it should be

232
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
You know when you have come to the ocean

233
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
Petrified ocean

234
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
That's simple goal

235
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,271
The one that members of Goo have been fighting for

236
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
It would seem like it's time has finally come

237
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,159
What is one little hitch

238
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
These platforms

239
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Are the most

240
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
Productive

241
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Habitats

242
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
In the world ocean

243
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Anywhere in the world

244
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
This is Milton love

245
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,935
I'm a research biologist

246
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,775
At the Marine Science Institute University of California Santa Barbara

247
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,079
Love is author of

248
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
Classic science books like

249
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
This is really the title

250
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,991
Probably more than you want to know about the fishes

251
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Pacific Coast

252
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
And also the sequel

253
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
Certainly more than you want to know

254
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
About the fishes of the

255
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Pacific Coast

256
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
A postmodern

257
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Experience

258
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,863
It's a 650 page home full of fish facts historical anecdotes

259
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
And some of his original

260
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Poetry

261
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
According to love it weighs 5 point

262
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
4 pound

263
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,543
It's actually a dangerous weapon in the wrong hands

264
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,639
And it feels cliche to say that a scientist just really loves

265
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
What's the thing that they study

266
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
But it must be sad

267
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
Milton love

268
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Mustache

269
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,295
I have a two tattoos of fish

270
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
And one is available

271
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
How Cod which is a rock

272
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,743
But the other one is of a deep-water angler fish

273
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
Is it

274
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
Edison Place can I see it

275
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Well hold on a sec

276
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
Take my shirt off

277
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,263
Without thinking twice he pulls off his shirt to reveal

278
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Updating shoulder tattoo

279
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:30,175
If this big female angler fish with a tiny little male fish latched onto her side

280
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
So there

281
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
There is the

282
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Female

283
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
And that little nubby thing

284
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
That's a bet

285
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
It's the real thing

286
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,975
Love grew up fishing on the beaches and Piers of Santa Monica

287
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,791
Do you study biology at UCSB

288
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,399
And eventually ended up back at his alma mater where he started up his own research lab

289
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
The love lab

290
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,543
But in the labs early days he had a really hard time getting grants to fund his fish

291
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
And

292
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,895
In 1995 I was at a

293
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
At a low point there was no question

294
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
I had no fun

295
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
But just when things were at their bleak

296
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
Love got an unexpected phone call

297
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
Iamsymphony says this is Lyman thorsteinson

298
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
I'm from the national biological survey

299
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,511
Which was a government program in the 90s

300
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,095
That aim to catalog and describe ecosystems throughout the country

301
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
And I swear to God this way

302
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
He said

303
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
If you had money

304
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
For research

305
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
What would you

306
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
What would you do

307
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
What does knockout signs usually works

308
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
Nobody

309
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
Nobody calls

310
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,687
And says I have money

311
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
It's the other way around it's a very dickensian kind of thing it's like you're the little bigger boy you come over and you go like

312
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Pizza

313
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,183
Could I have $100,000 set please

314
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
Love thought about how to answer this

315
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
Surprise question

316
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,887
On something that have been nagging him since he first came to Santa Barbara

317
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,471
Back in his 20s love you to collect fish for local Aquarium

318
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:02,591
And one day he and his fishing partner took their little Boston Whaler out to the oil platforms

319
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
And started fishing around them

320
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
There is like fish up the wazoo

321
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
And

322
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
We could have filled up the

323
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
Aquarium with all the fish week

324
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,855
Ever since then he had wondered what was going on down

325
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
Who's this dude like

326
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Offering me money and I said well

327
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,511
I'm really interested in these oil platform

328
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Forms off here

329
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,095
Their large structures I'd like to know

330
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
The role that they play as habitat

331
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
4 fishes and he said oh that sounds

332
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
Interesting

333
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,031
And so funding in hand Milton love got a team together

334
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
Rented a small submarine

335
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
And began to study the Platte

336
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
The first

337
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
Dive I made in

338
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
In the submersible

339
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
Was it platform Hidalgo which is located

340
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
Just barely in

341
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Central Calif

342
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Written about

343
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
450

344
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,207
If you don't water he took the submersible all the way to the bottom

345
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
The pylons reach the seabed

346
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,327
I was like blown away I didn't actually know what

347
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Expect

348
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
And there was a lot of fish

349
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,959
In particular schools of adult rockfish

350
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,519
Were swirling around the base of the plateau

351
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,383
And as he started making his way up the structure he saw a lot of smaller juvenile

352
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
And we're talking

353
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
Hundreds of

354
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
Thousands of these young fish

355
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,807
Bent the metal itself was

356
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Covered with

357
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
Colorful invertebrates

358
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
Cstars muscle sponges

359
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,743
And these little crabs walking all over the struts

360
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,815
Yeah I'm ever coming back on Deck to the research vessel on

361
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
The hatch pops

362
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Everybody's

363
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,935
You know all the lab is there and then

364
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,007
Crew the boats there and they're waiting for me to say something I said

365
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Yeah this was like

366
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
I said this

367
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Amazing

368
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Place

369
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:49,599
That platform dive was the first of many that Milton love and the other scientists that the love lab would do over the next

370
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
15 years

371
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Love remembers one dive in French

372
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
Particular from this.

373
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,975
Around a platform called

374
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Gilda

375
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,791
One of his colleagues went down first

376
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
And when she came back up

377
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
She said

378
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Basically

379
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
That was unbelievable

380
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,983
The scientists always videotape these Dives

381
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
Show people who didn't believe them

382
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,847
And so she played them the recording right there on the boat

383
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,663
She put it in there and we're going like oh my God

384
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
That's the most fish we've ever seen

385
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
Around the platform

386
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,551
Not every trip down with like that

387
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
All platforms

388
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Different love status

389
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Some don't have a lot of

390
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
It's always easier to hear

391
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:31,071
But often love found that these oil platforms were like a little Oasis of marine life

392
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
The ocean is a big empty place

393
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
An animal

394
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Tend to concentrate

395
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Around

396
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Stuff

397
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,031
The only reason they're there is they like to hang out with

398
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
What's stuff

399
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,615
Many invertebrates need a physical object

400
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
The latch on

401
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,199
Rockfish want to hide in nooks and

402
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
Crannies

403
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
Just be around anything with a little structure

404
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
They don't care what the

405
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
Structures made out of

406
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Pipe

407
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,927
NBA platform it can be a tiring

408
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Iraq

409
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,023
Oil platforms are particularly popular structures with the fishes

410
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,839
Because they have a lot of surface area and complexity

411
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,911
And they extend hundreds of feet through the water column like a

412
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
Marine skyscraper

413
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,495
Rockfish live at different depths

414
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Throughout their life cycle

415
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,311
Oil platform the sink

416
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Affordable home

417
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
Profession of all ages

418
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
Younger fish tend to live

419
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
Higher up the platform

420
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
Time After Time Love was Finding

421
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Lots of fun

422
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
There were so many

423
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
I started thinking like

424
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
What is this mean

425
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Biologic

426
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,975
Like okay so we're seeing a lot of juvenile fish

427
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,839
But how important are these platforms really in terms of the overall ecosystem

428
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:41,215
The bottom of that love and his team looked at one particular species of rockfish

429
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Boccaccio

430
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
Yeah I got a big mouth that's what it means

431
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
Italian boccaccio

432
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Means big mouth

433
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,663
The boccaccio are heavily fished around Santa Barbara

434
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,223
Around this time the stock was so depleted

435
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
Did the government close the fishery

436
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,111
But would love to the survey of seven different oil platforms

437
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,439
Victor Solis baby book got you and then we were talking

438
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
A lot of

439
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,767
About 450 thousand

440
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,839
Put that number in context love called up a scientist

441
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
The national Marine

442
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
Fisheries service

443
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,703
Who is responsible for counting all the boccaccio on the bus

444
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
Coast

445
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
Name is Alex

446
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
So I said Alex

447
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,847
We estimated that

448
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,151
There were 450000

449
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
Baby boccaccio

450
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
At the 7 plus

451
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Is that important

452
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
Cuz you don't like maybe it's not

453
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
I didn't know

454
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
So he had a model

455
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Betty Hughes

456
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
So he plugged it in and he came back

457
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
Couple weeks later and he said

458
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
Well

459
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,351
That's 20%

460
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
Cabal the baby will catch you on the entire Passage

461
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,447
Rapid7 platform

462
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,519
And babies are particularly important

463
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
To rebuilding the overall population

464
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
I'm going like

465
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,151
You know what that seems like those platforms

466
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
Important

467
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
For rebuilding

468
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
That particular

469
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Species

470
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,855
Still as Love's results were coming in

471
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
A lot of people were skeptical

472
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,487
Like maybe the rigs were just luring fish away from natural habitat

473
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Lymphostatic

474
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
Totally valid

475
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
Concerned

476
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
Does happen

477
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
A lot of artists

478
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,959
But after years of studying these oil platforms details

479
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
Continent that at least for some species

480
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
Betta fish

481
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,847
What platforms are giving the overall population of boost

482
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,663
Preponderance of evidence

483
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,943
Is that for

484
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:31,039
8 or 10 or maybe 12 species of rocks

485
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Fish

486
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
There are more of them in California

487
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
Because of all these platforms

488
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,231
Then would be here if the platforms

489
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
You're not here

490
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,071
And some scientist would go even further

491
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:48,703
A few years ago someone else tried to calculate just how biologically productive the platforms were

492
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,287
The most productive habitats are places like rainforest

493
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
Coral reef

494
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
But when the scientist ran the numbers

495
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,895
He found

496
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,223
That these platforms are the most productive

497
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
Habitats

498
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
In the world ocean

499
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Anywhere

500
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,879
Now we we should take that with a grain of salt

501
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
Tons of habitats that scientists haven't

502
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
Studied in this way

503
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
But the point is

504
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,791
These are fully functioning

505
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
They contain all the animals

506
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,655
That you would expect

507
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
Tusayan

508
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,215
A myriad of Nach

509
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
Which banks

510
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
The question

511
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,847
Is it in the interests of the people of California

512
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
To blow up

513
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
A fully functioning rave

514
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
And destroy it

515
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
In 2010

516
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,319
The California legislature decided it was

517
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,879
Any past ad to 503

518
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,183
A bill known as rigs to reefs

519
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
Oil companies

520
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,279
To leave an oil platform in place

521
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,839
If it could be shown to have a net benefit

522
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
On the marine environment

523
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,215
The oil companies would still need to plug the wells and Lop off the top

524
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
The platforms that boats could travel over it

525
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,103
But they would be allowed to leave some of the structure in place

526
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
So far though

527
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,919
No one is made use of this pill

528
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:07,039
And the future of California's Offshore platforms is still very much up in the air

529
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:11,647
A lot of environmentalists aren't sold on the idea of turning Riggs

530
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
Winter wreaths

531
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
They have concerns about liability

532
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
Potential for future leaks

533
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,351
The original lease agreements specify that the platform's orbit

534
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,399
Fully removed when the oil ran out

535
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,751
There wasn't a loophole that said they could stay if they turned into beautiful fish habitat

536
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
To me it's breaking a promise

537
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
This is Carla Frisk again

538
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,615
From Goodwill promise was

539
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
These would go away

540
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
And now they don't want them to go away

541
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
Tell

542
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,599
Community don't worry we're going to clean up our garbage after we're gone and then

543
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,255
And even if you love fish and I really do love fish

544
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
Her frustration is understandable

545
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:56,703
Environmental activist in Santa Barbara have had to deal with oil in their backyard for the last 50 years

546
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:03,103
In 2015 an oil pipeline a few miles north of Santa Barbara started leaking right into the ocean

547
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,223
It was a horrible reminder of the 69 spill and the dangers of living with oil in

548
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
Structure

549
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:14,623
And now the oil companies are saying hey these giant structures in the ocean that cause you all these problems

550
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,976
They're actually good for the environment look at the research their habitat

551
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
It's not

552
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:27,168
Carla is not convinced the oil executive support rigs to reefs because of their concern for the rockfish

553
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,728
My feeling is that they're motivated by saving money

554
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,032
Save a whole lot of money by not pulling nose out

555
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
The rig

556
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,616
Is off Santa Barbara or massive

557
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Infrastructure

558
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,456
Some of the largest oil Platforms in the world

559
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,016
Philippe removing them would be extremely

560
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,600
Difficult and avoiding those costs could save the oil companies

561
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
Millions of dollars

562
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,720
Under the 2010 rigs to reefs spell those savings will be

563
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,000
Split with a state

564
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,632
What environmental groups don't love signing off on a policy that feels like a handout

565
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Did the oil in this

566
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
Especially because environmental groups are currently fighting

567
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
New offshore oil development

568
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:09,664
The Trump Administration is indicated that they want to issue new offshore oil and gas leases off California

569
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,504
California has resisted the plan but environmental groups worry that

570
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,904
If the cost of decommissioning go down and the oil companies can argue that these structures are actually good for wildlife

571
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,744
They could have an easier time building new oil platforms

572
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:28,352
Do offshore oil drilling is the worst case scenario that all

573
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
Not just

574
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
Because of the risk of future spills

575
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,848
Because if you want to stop the worst impacts of climate change we're going to have to start leaving fossil fuels in the ground

576
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,712
Milton love agrees that climate change is one of the biggest threats to the world's oceans

577
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
And so I asked him

578
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
What he thinks about the fact

579
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
But the oil industry

580
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,112
Probably likes his research

581
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,672
I have tended to avoid dealing

582
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,792
With the oil industry to the extent I can but obviously they read my

583
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
My papers

584
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
They like it

585
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,168
I guess I mean it

586
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,192
CEO comment

587
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
Go like this is great stuff

588
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
I love your stuff

589
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,336
Thank you thank you thank I'm not ready

590
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:15,968
But his findings have definitely helped oil companies make their argument

591
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Stent

592
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
That

593
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
My findings

594
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
Bolster

595
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
The oil companies

596
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
Dispositions

597
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,256
That's just what happens with facts

598
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
The facts

599
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,656
Of Milton loves research don't mean that oil infrastructure is

600
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Is good for wildlife

601
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,216
That usually is

602
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,008
I just mean that

603
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,080
A few instances off the southern California coast

604
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,408
Oil platforms have become useful habitat

605
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,456
For a few different species

606
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
A fish

607
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,832
He's not in favor of building new offshore oil platform

608
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,392
Or even building lots of new artificial reefs

609
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,184
But in this situation

610
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
The artificial Reef

611
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
Is already there

612
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,072
My view is once you put something in the ocean and it becomes

613
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
Habitat for animals

614
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
I don't think you should pull it out

615
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,240
Cuz like why should we punish those animals just cuz they have The Misfortune of

616
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,312
Settling out on a piece of Steel rather than on the rock

617
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:18,176
After all Rockfish are just looking for a little structure in LA

618
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,992
They don't care if it's a rocky outcrop

619
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
Worship rack

620
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
Orion oil pump

621
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:40,448
Social things to Kristen Hislop of the environmental defense center who also spoke to us for this

622
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
And also a big thank you

623
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
Did Janet Bridgers

624
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
From Earth alert

625
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,360
Kindly letting us use audio from her interview

626
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,384
Bed bug bombs

627
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
Coming up

628
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,784
Taking what we learn from offshore oil platforms

629
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
In applying it

630
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,856
Offshore wind farms

631
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,680
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sand

632
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:17,568
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

633
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:22,944
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is in another room and we're all hearing.

634
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,248
Voice technology talk to us

635
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,552
It is a creation of Sonic trash

636
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,368
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

637
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,952
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

638
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,000
To make them more human

639
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
Turn the living room lights on

640
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Okay

641
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
Dim the living room lights to 50%

642
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
Okay

643
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:52,640
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

644
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,456
Makes for a much more natural experience

645
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,504
Turn the living room lights on

646
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
Dim the living room lights to 50

647
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,368
2%

648
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:09,024
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

649
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,560
About how are sounds gay

650
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
Is impacting our health

651
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,400
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

652
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,472
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

653
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
Right here

654
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
NPR

655
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
Think about doing

656
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Astoria

657
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Like this

658
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
We talked about The Accidental benefits

659
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,480
Of human putting stuff in the ocean

660
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,504
Is that you could

661
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,808
Possibly Come Away with the idea that

662
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,136
This isn't necessarily a good thing all the time that we should just

663
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:39,488
Dumb stuff in the ocean

664
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Report that piece

665
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,048
To address this issue

666
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
Head on

667
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,376
A little nervous

668
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
About

669
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
With the peace you know you could kind of

670
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,240
Draw the wrong conclusion of like take the conclusion of

671
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
The peace like

672
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
It too far

673
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
Yeah if you start to think

674
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
A fish like

675
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
Together around

676
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Stuff then let's just

677
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,272
What are the water and the crazy thing is

678
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
We have done this

679
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
We have built artificial reefs

680
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,904
A lot in the past and made a people have

681
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,232
Thrown all kinds of things into the ocean thinking that

682
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,024
This is going to be beneficial there has been

683
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
Old washing machine

684
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,096
Subway cars

685
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:20,704
They even sunk in Old aircraft carrier once off the Florida Panhandle

686
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,728
Became known as the

687
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,264
The great carrier Reef

688
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
Clever

689
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,896
And the results are mixed often will you put

690
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:35,296
Structure into the water it does attract fish

691
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Support these

692
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,976
Sorts of projects artificial reefing are far fisherman because concentrates all the fish in one place

693
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,560
Play some music to catch and so an argument against artificial reefs is that

694
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,608
They lead to Arkin exacerbate

695
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
Overfishing

696
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:56,032
And that's totally a real concern is also one of the more egregious examples of a misguided

697
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
Artificial reefing attempt

698
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
That I came across

699
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:03,200
What happened in the 1970s were people dumped half a million

700
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,808
Tires automobile tires into the ocean off Fort Lauderdale

701
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,368
Ostensibly you know in the NFL to create

702
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,904
An artificial Reef

703
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,720
That seems like the worst possible substrate

704
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:18,816
To build a wreath upon

705
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,656
Completely and it was an abject failure it's like a 30-year

706
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:27,520
30 acre Dead Zone around there now it end and not only that but like

707
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:33,920
Delta Tires Leach stuff that was detrimental to a natural coral reef fish having come through the worst

708
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,736
Case scenario of taking this idea and going

709
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,760
Too far with it

710
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,112
So the lesson is that we should not dress till the ocean with our stuff

711
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,720
Absolutely not I do not take that weapon away from the store anyway

712
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,304
But we are going to put cumin in

713
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,328
The structure into the ocean

714
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,424
As humans were going to put things out in the marine environment we're building

715
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,520
Breakwater's around Harbors we're building bridges were building

716
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:05,664
A lot of oil platforms moving the future probably going to be building a lot of renewable energy

717
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,968
Twin platform for offshore

718
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
Wind

719
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,760
So this is Jeremy

720
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:14,880
Place he's a professor of marine biology at Cal Poly Pomona

721
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,280
That ran the numbers and Quantified how biologically productive the California oil rigs are if you remember that from the story

722
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
And Jeremy's

723
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,168
Argument is basically that you know with all of this infrastructure we should be thinking about

724
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,704
The impact it will have

725
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,104
On the marine environment and seeing if there are ways that we could design the structure before it goes in the wall

726
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,664
Water so that it has a chance

727
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,944
To become

728
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
Beneficial habit

729
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,040
So in the oil platform Astoria it was at

730
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Total accent

731
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,880
Peking rapes but he saying that maybe

732
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:50,720
We can actually do some of this intentionally or maybe even do it better

733
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
With some intent

734
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,352
Think about how we could design human infrastructure

735
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,888
To maximize its habitat

736
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,984
Annie's particularly focus on the question of offshore wind

737
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,288
Which to me is this release date Apple because

738
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
Unlike oil platforms which are

739
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:10,176
Problematic when it comes to climate change offshore wind

740
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,248
Is this climate solution in this potentially

741
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,296
Important kind of solution out

742
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,624
Yeah we know that we're going to need to build a lot of these structures

743
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,720
The coming decades like if we want to avoid the worst case scenarios when I

744
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
Comes the

745
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,280
Climate change we're going to need some

746
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
Offshore wind

747
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,376
On and hopefully now these Offshore platforms

748
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:34,752
Start can be put into designing them and then once they're put out there we can study them and understand

749
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,592
You know the positive and negative that's going on and try to revise those overtime and

750
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,640
I'm and do the best we can

751
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,456
I would all the stuff for putting out into the marine environment

752
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,248
So is this happening anywhere yet

753
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
Does anyone

754
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,320
Actually designing wind platforms

755
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,112
With biological life

756
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
Priority

757
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,952
Yeah we're kind of at the beginning of this

758
00:30:54,208 --> 00:31:00,096
But the place right now in the world with the most offshore wind is the North Sea in Europe

759
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
And

760
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,192
There are a lot of wind turbines there that are just

761
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,008
They're basically just attached to the seabed by a

762
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
Single pole

763
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:13,152
Doesn't have a lot of complexity that structure and one of the things that's really

764
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,432
Great about

765
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:19,296
Offshore oil platforms as if they've got some of that structural complexity that fish

766
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,344
Penta light show in the North

767
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,488
See one thing that people are doing is starting to think about like how can we add a little bit of structural complexity

768
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
2DS

769
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Wind turbine

770
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:36,448
And you're up in the North Sea they're doing things to increase the complexity on a down at the base.

771
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,288
There's opportunities to create more complex habitats surrounding it with

772
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
Cory rocker

773
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
Different structures

774
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,504
To try to improve the habitat for fish living down there but you know off California that situation is actually really

775
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,904
Difference the ocean floor is as you go through out to sea on California drops off a really quickly and gets a really.

776
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,440
And so

777
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:01,280
Offshore wind turbines in California if they do come

778
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
Are actually going to need to be designed to

779
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
Float

780
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,168
There's a whole set of new challenges in terms of deploying

781
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,728
Is floating structures but a lot of them

782
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,776
Artist going to be underwater

783
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
Is very similar

784
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,128
Sort of structure to the top part

785
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,688
Underwater of these offshore oil platforms

786
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,248
Kind of where we're at right now is trying to

787
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,064
Studied official living on these offshore oil platform

788
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,368
It's kind of a proxy what you would expect

789
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,952
The fish are going to experience living off these floating wind platforms

790
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,608
So Jeremy is hoping that his research can inform the design of the structures if and when offshore wind becomes

791
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Cereality

792
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,960
In California but you know

793
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,288
He's at he's a marine biologist is obviously focused on fish

794
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
There are

795
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:51,712
Huge engineering challenges and end design challenges with offshore wind and solar

796
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,248
MultiCare about

797
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,112
Fish is not necessary is not necessarily be the easiest

798
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
I think the

799
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,720
The economic and Engineering challenges

800
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,256
Are pretty great

801
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
With these structures

802
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
So

803
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:11,680
Initially at least it's probably hard to come in and say well then let's think about how he's going to be good for the fish

804
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,496
Ultimately that I think that's what we should be doing

805
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,312
At the end of the day we still we shouldn't get

806
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,128
Too carried away with these with these ideas or

807
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:26,528
Think that we can design perfect habitats and at the expense of natural ones I think that you know

808
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,136
Anytime a piece of infrastructure into the water it's going to be

809
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:37,536
Disruptive on some level and then that's always that's always true and we always need to be thinking about how to mitigate

810
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,096
The negative impacts that a big

811
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:44,448
Piece of human infrastructure is going to have it with offshore wind

812
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,264
Nothing that you are obviously very concerned about is

813
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
Is seabird

814
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,360
Buy the whole other set of of design challenges you how do you

815
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,176
How do you build these structures in a way where

816
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
They don't disrupt

817
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
Seabird habitat

818
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
But I think

819
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,808
The first step is like how do we mitigate

820
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:05,184
Disruption and damage and then you can start thinking about what are ways in which we could

821
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
Maybe actually have

822
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Small benefits

823
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Right

824
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,792
Designed to never replace

825
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
The concept of conservation

826
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:15,168
Total Innovation and design and impact is on should go hand-in-hand

827
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,728
And even though we can make a nice habitat

828
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,776
On the bottom of a platform

829
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,568
It doesn't mean that we shouldn't be

830
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Protecting

831
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
The natural

832
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Cinebarre

833
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
Just as much as we always share

834
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
You know like

835
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
Replace it.

836
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:32,832
Completely there's no but nothing you're going to design is is better than

837
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:37,696
What's in leaving nature alone exactly right completely end

838
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,232
Some of the most interesting

839
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,792
Work that's being done

840
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,632
In terms of artificial reefs that I think people do support is

841
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:52,288
Assisting about habitat restoration you know a place where we've done a lot of damage with some other kind of development is there a way

842
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,824
That we can intervene

843
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,152
Again when did some kind of design solution

844
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:02,528
But for the purposes of of trying to rehabilitate something that was already there

845
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
Which policies in which

846
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,088
We don't disrupt Greece

847
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:20,192

860

For example they learn that

861
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
It has to be rough enough

862
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,872
Attached

863
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,152
Smooth enough

864
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:05,504
It's not a good location for other organisms like sponges in algae

865
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,064
That can take over and crowd out the coral

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

897
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,272
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

898
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,624

899
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,976
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

900
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,280
Actually if I'm being honest

901
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,328
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

902
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:35,008
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

903
