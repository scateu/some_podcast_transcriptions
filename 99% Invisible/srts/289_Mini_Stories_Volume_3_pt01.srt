51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,392
Denise

52
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
Hi my name is Denise Boniface

53
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:11,072
Am I own Optimus diving in Rocky Mountain House Alberta Canada

54
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:15,936
Yasso Denise is from Alberta Canada where she owns scuba diving

55
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Anthony

56
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,288
In Alberta as you may know is not a

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,664
So is your scuba diving

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,968
And Alberto you're doing it

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,296
Clear cold air dark there murky

60
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
It's kind of creepy to

61
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
So there's this one leg called

62
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:43,328
Trisha surrounded by mountains it's right in in a mountain valley

63
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
Very very remote

64
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,936
If you find the right spot on the lake

65
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,264
And I've about 30 feet down heel

66
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
You find a ship

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,384
It doesn't really look like except it looks like

68
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,992
Iowa Lumber that's all broken up and

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
Laying there

70
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,856
And then there's a lot of refrigeration coils

71
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
What are the refrigeration costs for

72
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
We're going to get to that

73
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
Okay for now so

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,584
You make your way down sort of through this murky Darkness

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
Like pile of

76
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:21,216
Lumber and debris 868

77
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:27,872
Hey girl and gets excited

78
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,224
It's pitch-dark but if you shine a light on it

79
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
Read it

80
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
And Denise

81
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
House Reddit operations how to cut a secret world project involving

82
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:48,096
Special built January to April 1943 with a prototype

83
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
More information contact with Canadian parks

84
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
Westchester

85
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
Wow

86
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
So there's like a hyperlink

87
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
In the bottom of a lake www.

88
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,760
What is a QR code

89
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,856
Yeah it's okay so there's so many things about this pack that I love I love that it's

90
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
The bottom of the lake Isle of

91
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:17,280
The part where it says for more info contact the Canadian Park service because it's cuz you could just

92
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
Stumble across this wild

93
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,143
Like strolling at the bottom of a Canadian lake

94
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
Actually I asked Denise that and she was like yeah you you could because there's a lot of people to tighten this leg

95
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,383
But of course the most intriguing part of the plaque

96
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
Is the part about the sea

97
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
Secret World War

98
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
To project

99
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
Involving the use of ice

100
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
In shipping

101
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
So what was it

102
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135
So okay so in the early

103
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
19/4

104
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
During World War II

105
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,743
German submarines

106
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
U-boats

107
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
As they were called

108
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
Or basically wreaking

109
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,399
Havoc on Allied ships in the Atlantic

110
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
Ocean just

111
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Thinking then left and right

112
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,799
And So eventually this person named Admiral mountbatten

113
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
Goes to Winston Churchill and he's like

114
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
We have to do something about this

115
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,223
And I think I know what the solution is

116
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
A giant Unsinkable

117
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,111
Aircraft carrier sized ship

118
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Made of ice

119
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,559
And actually turtle is intrigued like it sounds like one of those

120
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:27,935
Farfetch'd ideas that the kind of gets flooded during times of War but never actually gets billed

121
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Except for this

122
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,007
Really did get built or at least

123
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
A prototype of it

124
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,615
God built and that is the Shipwreck

125
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
At the bottom of

126
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Patricia Lake

127
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
And that's what

128
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
The plaque commemorates

129
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Wow

130
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
So what in the world made

131
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,831
Admiral mountbatten

132
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
Think that an unsinkable ship

133
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,183
Should be made of ice

134
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Yeah

135
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
Sole

136
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
What the hell

137
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
Reply so that was a big

138
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,239
They were actively looking for alternatives

139
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,103
And then the second thing is that they they hopes that this ice ship would be

140
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
So dense

141
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
And it would basically be induced

142
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,503
And what made them think that ice would be indestructible because it doesn't

143
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Seem like that

144
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Bright

145
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,367
Oh it actually it wasn't just play nice

146
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,439
If they weren't they're going to build these ships out of a mixture of

147
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,231
Of ice and Sawdust

148
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Kampai

149
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,607
Named after its inventor a guy named Jeffrey

150
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
Sophie mix

151
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
Serve water and wood chips together and then

152
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,775
Frozen and maybe ice

153
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
Really really strong

154
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,127
And so this guy Jeffrey Pike he

155
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,175
He invented not only by creeper

156
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,503
Came up with the idea of building a ship out of it

157
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
And then he got that idea

158
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
To Admiral mountbatten

159
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,415
So the ships will be built from blocks of

160
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,231
I treat and then there would be sleepy pipes

161
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
With coolant running through the hole

162
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Keep it up

163
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
So that's that's the refrigerator

164
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
Are quails a Denisa the bottom

165
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
Anti crease really was

166
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Dislike

167
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
Credibly strong and then

168
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
Mixture then there's this

169
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,407
Amazing anecdote in the story where Admiral mountbatten

170
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,479
Who is not the inventor of high-grade but

171
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
She's like the main kind of

172
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,575
Evangelist for this idea and he was so

173
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
Hype about it that he brings

174
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
A piece of pie feet to a meeting

175
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,511
This is a meeting in which they were trying to convince

176
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,839
The Americans or the British were trying to convince the Americans to

177
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
To get on board this

178
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
This crazy ice ship

179
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Plan

180
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:41,055
So he brings a block of Pie Face the meeting along with a regular block of ice

181
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,383
And at some point he does this demonstration where he

182
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,687
Shakes out his revolver and he shoots

183
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
The regular ice

184
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
And it's

185
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
Splinters into a thousand little pieces

186
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
And then he

187
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
He shoots The Patriot

188
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
And the bullet bounces off the pykrete and actually sort of ricochets into the leg of one of his car

189
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
Successful actually

190
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:13,055
Play take Claritin total success and and they're all like thumbs up like Greenlight Full Speed Ahead

191
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:19,455
And yeah they did they decide to go forward with this crazy plan Winston Churchill signs off on it I'm not sure what

192
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
What all Americans

193
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
Sign off on it but they

194
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
American said we'll help you

195
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:28,159
You do this and then I guess at some point they also got Canadians involved because they

196
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
They end up building

197
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
This prototype on this little late

198
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
In Alberta

199
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Mike Patricia

200
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
I named it project

201
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Habakkuk

202
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
After a Bible

203
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
And I think the verses

204
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,007
Pretty interesting Cemetery today cuz

205
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,847
Behold ye among the Nations and look

206
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
And wonder marvelous

207
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,199
For I am working a work in your days

208
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,991
Which you will not believe

209
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:58,879
He told to you Bible verse

210
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:04,255
We are building a crazy thing thing

211
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,839
And habakkuk apparently was the name of the Hebrew

212
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Prophet witch

213
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
I certainly never knew

214
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:16,031
Prototype itself was built by Canadian conscientious objectors

215
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,127
Didn't know what they were building and who had opted

216
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
For alternative service jobs

217
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
They were like giving this

218
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,295
Job and not really told that it actually was

219
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
Abortion before the war

220
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,303
In just a few months they built a prototype of this ship but it ended up being harder to build and then more expensive

221
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,887
Then they thought and by the time the Prototype was ready

222
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,263
The Warhead kind of moved on like they were figuring out how to build the atomic bomb

223
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
They figured out how to mask

224
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,103
Produce smaller aircraft carriers

225
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,991
And in the end they basically Scott the project and ultimately let it sink into the bottom

226
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
Aflac Patricia and

227
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
As we know you can

228
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
See it there today

229
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,743
The coolest thing about diving the habitat is being able to stay that you don't

230
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,559
Like its it is cool to Diamond that's nice

231
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,911
But today but too many times it's not that interesting

232
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,199
Yes apparently like if you build a ship out of ice if I just sort of like

233
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
Turns into nothing

234
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,039
The bottom of the ocean

235
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
Once

236
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
You've seen enough

237
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,927
That's fine that's awesome

238
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,423
Special thanks to Debbie Schneiderman who sent in the tip

239
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
Project habakkuk

240
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,287
Jesse send it in response to the mini Stories episode that we did last year

241
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
So if you also have a mini

242
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Suggestion

243
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
We do read them

244
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663

Next up producer Emmett Fitzgerald

247
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
All right

248
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Are you ready

249
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
Yeah you should just start

250
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,463
I don't know if you're going to do

251
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,791
This is a story about a ruin

252
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Probably

253
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
The most

254
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,679
Famous Bruin maybe Roman Colosseum

255
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Aerocool

256
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Nyurban

257
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
I've never been

258
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:27,359
I've also never been but you can you can picture

259
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
In a white

260
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Columns

261
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
Kind of Dusty

262
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,367
Denuded of all life and it just looks like a classic ruin

263
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:45,023
White and brown hawk

264
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
I think that's like yeah that's part of it image we have of ruins but I was on Twitter the other day and I found this kind of amazing thread

265
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,263
Read the future all these paintings from the 19th century

266
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,823
The Coliseum is totally green

267
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
It's like this

268
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,919
This greenhouse covered in Vines

269
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,295
Plants and plant life and it was a thread put together by this guy named Paul Cooper

270
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
Cheese Annapolis

271
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:14,719
Standard PhD researcher at the University of East Anglia and he studies the history of ruin

272
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:21,375
And he says that you know it until the middle of the nineteenth Century the Coliseum was totally overrun with plants

273
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Shrubs and Vines

274
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,471
Growing everywhere and then like always

275
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,799
Artists and Poets were right about the Colosseum is this

276
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Verdant

277
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,895
Greenhouse Charles Dickens

278
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,735
Arches overrun with green

279
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:43,135
And in 1850s this British botanist a man named Richard Deacon decides to do

280
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
Botanical survey of the Coliseum

281
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,743
Cataloging all of the plant

282
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Growing on them

283
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,631
What will he find a grave

284
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,447
Are you doing, growing around on the crumbling ruins

285
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,799
So that's that Paul Cooper that's the total fertility the twitters right exactly

286
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
And he told me about all the

287
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
The different plants

288
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
This guy Richard

289
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
Confound 56 varieties of grass

290
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,479
Cypress Hills Harley-Davidson

291
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,295
Incredible variety

292
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
What comes out of Dickens book

293
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
Is this incredibly poetic description of

294
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,463
Scrolling landscape

295
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
But

296
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,815
Variety

297
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
Describes how it sits down

298
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:30,495
Cool and in the lower case of the Coliseum but the dryer and woman on on the top light

299
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,823
Microclimate

300
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,895
Steffes biodome of overflowing life

301
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
Specifically the some of the plants

302
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,295
I was so rather that they did not see occur anywhere else in Western Europe

303
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
And so

304
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,879
Deacon sits down and tries to start of workout

305
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:53,279
How these plants ended up in this one spot in this like iconic cultural spot is but it is sort of a botanical

306
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,399
He comes up with the hypothesis

307
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Let me

308
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,727
These clowns must have been brought into the Colosseum

309
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,031
On on the phone or even the stomach

310
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,847
Of the animals the Romans brought into the arena to fight

311
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
Brahmin Friday

312
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
Gladiators May brought in

313
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,575
Giraffes and other kinds of African Wildlife for a ceremonial hunts inside the coliseum in the theory was

314
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
She has plans to traveling on the backs of

315
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,207
Host of other animals that move around that we've moved around the world

316
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
The bat might be there.

317
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
The cause of

318
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
5 what brought

319
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
These plants are the call

320
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
But so great

321
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
It's a little hard to

322
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,775
It's a cool it's a cool story

323
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
And

324
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Paula Cooper

325
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Really likes

326
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,503
Animal hunts

327
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,831
Proving humans can reach the level of civilization

328
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,135
Complete Dominion

329
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:56,511
Triumph of the wild and destructive nature of the natural world

330
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,351
But what's the Buried and in the fern and Gatsby's animals

331
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,679
What is natural seeds to ultimately going to

332
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,031
Innovate and climb over the household magnificent ruin

333
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
So how did it happen that

334
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
This

335
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
Inadvertent

336
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
Microclimate

337
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
Almost Greenhouse

338
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,015
Become the dusty dry ruin that we think of today

339
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,927
So in 1870 Italy gets unified under a secular democratic government

340
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:29,791
Take control of the city of Rome which I previously been in the hands of of the papacy

341
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,839
And this new government is really trying to say

342
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
Create a set of rational scientific modern Italian identity but they see that is really rooted in this ancient

343
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
Roman history

344
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,335
Until they care a lot about these old ruins like

345
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:47,711
The Coliseum and projecting a certain Italian this to these buildings represent

346
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,247
And the plants don't

347
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,623
4

348
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,927
The ruins

349
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Hyundai

350
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,655
And even if the time there's some real pushback from scientist from the Botanical Community who say you know stop this is this like

351
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,727
Special micro ecosystem filled with all these

352
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
Totally unique

353
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Plant species

354
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Italian

355
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
Buff list and countess

356
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
Amazon TEAS test

357
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,479
Poetically

358
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
Archaeological cupidity

359
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
Oculus go

360
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Staples

361
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,671
What's the time

362
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
Electronics

363
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
You got into the

364
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,119
The ruling party

365
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,959
The ruin was completely stripped and excavated

366
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
I completely cleaned witches

367
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,591
Unless you unfortunately that the state we find in today

368
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
Socially about whatever you think is

369
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:53,503
Proper thing to preserve I mean do you preserve it is true

370
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,551
The Vines were destroying the room in

371
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,439
But what is the cost of removing all the vines

372
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
And

373
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
What is the

374
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:08,351
History represented in the natural history of the things that are there

375
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
Cooper says that when he sees these

376
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,447
These beautiful paintings of the Colosseum

377
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
These rare plants travel there are potentially on the back

378
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
Interesting questions about

379
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
About what state

380
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,967
We should preserver ruining is it just

381
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:28,063
The rocks that the only thing that we care about our stories

382
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,135
Embedded potentially within other aspects of

383
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
What's there that

384
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Tallinn

385
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Parts of the history

386
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,023
Yeah it does make me sad to think that we've lost

387
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
The Romantic potential

388
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Abyss

389
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,655
Site of this incredible ruins overgrown with Greenery

390
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,799
Buried stories hidden in these different layers of History

391
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:54,943
I don't like the floor growing up to take you to ruin can tell a huge part of the story

392
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
So

393
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,295
Talking to pollen and then you have seen the Twitter thread that he

394
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,135
Together and then later turn into an article at a really just made me think about

395
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,183
Historical preservation in Ark

396
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,487
Archaeological preservation really

397
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
What gets

398
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,815
To be a part of what lives on and what

399
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
We choose not to leave

400
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
But doesn't make the cut

401
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,911
Who's in the spaces

402
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Always plants

403
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,983
In the story of the built world is not just

404
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,543
The things we build its all the stuff around it and it

405
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,847
It could be that natural flora and fauna

406
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,151
Effects

407
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,247
And there are still some plants in the coliseum in NC

408
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Make decisions about what

409
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,903
The pick

410
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
The space and so it's smooth

411
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
Even there even more kind of

412
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Outliers

413
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
So then the rest of the

414
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Adult environment

415
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,607
Little bit of greenery in a gray

416
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Concrete world

417
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,855
So a while back nine ipi's digital director Kolstad started researching

418
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Story about

419
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Sackcloth

420
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Dresses

421
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
The type of DIY clothing

422
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
From upcycle of flour

423
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
And feed sacks

424
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,607
And we considered it for a full episode for a while but current had a connection to this

425
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
That made it even better

426
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
As a mini story

427
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,007
Homemade tack cloth apparel group really popular during the Great Depression

428
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,615
But as I was looking into it I thought the idea seems familiar somehow

429
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:32,991
So I called it this is story and I know to see if maybe she had told me about them when I was a bit younger

430
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
Okay

431
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
So

432
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
Can you

433
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Tell us briefly

434
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
Who you are and what you do

435
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:44,511
I'm Sally Gregory CrossFit I'm a professor at the University of Minnesota

436
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,911
Where I teach courses on science in American culture

437
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
So my mom was born in Michigan during World War II

438
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,519
And her dad worked in Detroit at the time

439
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:00,383
My father was shipped overseas

440
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,759
So I call people from Michigan she refers to the shape

441
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,551
Of Michigan as looking like I

442
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
Gloved hand

443
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:15,231
And refers to it as the Fillmore the where it is in the hand right if they're trying to tell you where they are from

444
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,535
Expensive toilet there hand in Lake Point to part of that

445
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
Unlike other places in America

446
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,631
People in Michigan

447
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
To deal with shortages

448
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
In the late 1920s

449
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
Going to World War II

450
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:30,847
When I was a little girl my grandmother did most of the spelling for all of us

451
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:35,967
And so the fabric that she used for

452
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,551
But she would pick out by going to the local General Store

453
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,903
My great-grandmother would buy sacks of flour and then reuse those fat

454
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,743
And the flower stalks became on the fabric store

455
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,047
These dresses

456
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
Any other guy picture

457
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
Socks

458
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,423
Butthole rice or something which are

459
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
Terrible burlap

460
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:02,847
Style socks like what was the fabric like finely woven because it was

461
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
Need to hold flour

462
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,199
All cotton fabric

463
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:15,647
These days we think of flower is being something that comes in these smaller 5 or 10 lb bag

464
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
Made a paper

465
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,720
Back then it was a different story

466
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
So did the flower companies know

467
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,984
That people were using their flower socks

468
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,776
An upscaling them

469
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
As dresses

470
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,360
Yeah I've only started to figure this out over time

471
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
And they start to adjust their designs accordingly it's actually you think that would wash back out so you can have this clean white

472
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,600
White cloth and others went the other direction with it and they design these pattern

473
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,696
25 flour sacks with dancers are jockeys are bunnies are

474
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:54,304
Flowers are other interesting things in my mom's grandmother would sit through those options and

475
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,840
Bring home pay rent from the store

476
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,632
Cheap learn quickly

477
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
I didn't like

478
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,312
So I think she avoided pink Fabric or pink flowers on fabric

479
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,360
People that time also turn sax

480
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,664
Quilts curtains even diapers

481
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
Informers reused

482
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,248
Livestock feed bags to

483
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,040
Matt Patrick was rougher

484
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
But it still work for things like tile

485
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,648
Experience

486
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:24,000
Eating a piece of that

487
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Apparently my

488
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:30,656
Great-grandfather had a feedbag Hebron like great-grandmother meet him for doing really dirty work

489
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,704
Like to dirty even for work

490
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,776
Helping out cows in labor

491
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:43,456
Are you really didn't want to wear even your ordinary work clothes because it was really a pretty bloody mess

492
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Wow

493
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,272
So you could buy

494
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Seed by a sack

495
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,624
Of feed for the cows

496
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
And then

497
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
That's

498
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
That's pretty crazy

499
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,840
That's what I recall

500
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:06,496
Tow companies across caught on to the sack fabric Trend and they realize they could boost their sales with nicer cotton and

501
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,800
Depression worse or the fashionable patterns

502
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080
Along the way

503
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,616
And some manufacturers

504
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,432
Even sponsored National sack cloth dress making copy

505
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,856
She actually said

506
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,952
This quote that I really liked that it was part of the fabric of life

507
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,792
Is living in rural America

508
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
Ultimately these designs they evolved

509
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:38,240
Beyond just being Look fashion

510
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,776
I think is really fast

511
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,128
I so want to go to a fabric store and buy velvet

512
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
Are wool or linen

513
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,576
Was going to the General Store pick out your fabric

514
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
Because no matter what

515
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720
Even if you're wearing

516
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,512
Crestmont Ave cycling

517
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,864
Do you want to look at you want to express yourself

518
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,144
Stuck at Universal thing

519
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
In some cases they fight about you

520
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
Bring him home

521
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,264
And I'm breathing the same family get out

522
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,616
Because of wearing the same patterns of Cyclops you could actually tell who is from what family by

523
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:21,760
Buy another pattern that they were wearing like a Tartan like I killed for something

524
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
So cool

525
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,344
This is been really great I love talking about this

526
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
I love the fact

527
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,392
My mom's a historian

528
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
That is just so interested in these things

529
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,744

She was like okay you can you can cut any part of this you want that you've got to keep

538
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
She knows what she's doing

539
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
Alright thanks so much

When do the end of the show

543
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
You may have noticed

544
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
A new production credit

545
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
Since we started using

546
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
All original music

547
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,784
How did your voice on here why don't you actually introduce yourself and what you do with show

548

I'm Sean real and I'm the composer for Adderall the music

549
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:37,280
Until you have a Mini Storages that use your first money for it so it's my first

550
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,096
Radio story ever so there we go

00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,656
Okay well congratulations so it's what's your

552
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:47,264
So it's the late 1800s and people are just starting to consume recorded music

553
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,824
In the process of recording at this time is

554
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,128
Kind of hectic and I like to imagine

555
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,688
A lot of fun but maybe

556
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
Maybe more hectic so

557
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:01,600
Before they use microphones and Studio sound was captured by these big horns

558
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,928
Which were made of like mainly brass or copper

559
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,720
And these recording horns

560
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,512
Would collect and focus

561
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,792
Sound Vibrations

562
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,632
Into this little diaphragm in the diaphragm would vibrate a stylus

563
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,936
They cut a Groove into a wax disc

564
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,776
Should I be picturing these recording horns pretty much like

565
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
Phonograph

566
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,872
I don't fashion photography that plays out to one of these

567
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,432
Yeah it's like the same thing it's

568
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
OK Google

569
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
Side part of images

570
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Same backwards

571
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:35,392
The forwards for the problem with this process was that these recording horns were limited

572
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,464
In what sound frequencies they'd respond to

573
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
So certain instruments like

574
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:44,096
Tubas and French horns were which were also made of brass

575
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,144
I'll get picked up much louder

576
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
10 string instruments

577
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Guitars

578
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,728
Violence

579
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
So now it is

580
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,360
We record every instrument on its own track and do a lot of leveling after-the-fact but

581
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:00,736
Back then they had to record whole orchestras with just one or sometimes

582
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
2

583
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,112
If they were really fancy of these like thing recording horns in a single room

584
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,696
And then they just make copies of the disc that they recorded on there was no editing

585
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,024
If there was too much French horn or if an opera singer like

586
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,584
And blew out the recording what their falsetto

587
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
You'd rather just go away and you do it again

588
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,192
So in order to get a balanced mix

589
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,496
I'm Different instruments and voices

590
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,544
Sound Engineers would arrange

591
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
Musicians

592
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
All around us

593
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
Studio add berries

594
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Distance

595
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
From the recording

596
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,712
Sometimes they do have

597
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
Louder instruments like french horns

598
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:40,160
Pointed at the back wall away from the recording horn and the musicians would be watching their conductor like anime

599
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:48,352
And they put pianos on top of platform so that you know like the mallets and chords that are inside would be lined up

600
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
With the recording horn

601
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
And this one's on my face

602
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,984
They'd sometimes put a singer like on a little

603
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Trolley

604
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
So that

605
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
An assistant coach

606
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,128
Wheel them closer to the horn for quieter vocal passages

607
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,688
And will them away during loud ones

608
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:09,600
Chaotic is like a Rube Goldberg recording of an orchestra

609
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,672
But the string instruments were the hardest to record

610
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,256
And because of that like stand up bass parts were often just

611
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
Play it on tuba instead

612
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,840
And a lot of Engineers

613
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
Didn't want to deal with

614
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
Recording violin

615
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:28,032
Very few recordings with violins on them before a certain time is that true

616
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,360
Well there were actually a fair amount of recordings of viola

617
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
But

618
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
He was part because of the engineers going through all the

619
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,224
Was troubled see these elaborate session

620
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,528
But also because of this

621
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,184
Okay so can you describe what you're holding

622
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,768
I'm holding Astro violin witch

623
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
My bandmate founded

624
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,584
Does novelty music shop and it's

625
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
It's got like

626
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
The neck

627
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
And

628
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,240
Like head and Bridge of a violin and the strings

629
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:02,080
But instead of like a body it's just got this like

630
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,640
Wooden rod and then

631
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
Dislike

632
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Huge horn

633
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
Yeah it's coming out of it

634
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:14,112
A violin with the body that has the

635
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:19,488
Thinking that resonate that goes up against your neck when you play a violin that's all gone and then instead

636
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Is this

637
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
Bisley a trumpet

638
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,936
Sitting on your pointed folded back into itself in the sound comes out of the end of the of the trumpet

639
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,240
Just like how recording was like

640
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
The gramophone back

641
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,056
Backwards this is also the same concept

642
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Of the gramophone

643
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,872
Vibrating of the strings

644
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:40,224
Goes into this diaphragm that's down here by the bridge

645
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,528
And it vibrates the sound

646
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
Which cats

647
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,576
Projected out

648
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
By the horn

649
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
Wow that's amazing

650
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
It looks really

651
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
It's like

652
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:54,816
It would be the centerpiece of a steampunk Orchestra basically yeah there are there are

653
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,352
Steampunk bands

654
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,888
Bat that uses

655
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,472
I would love to

656
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
That's awesome

657
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
In a way

658
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,744
In its native state like in this room it kind of sounds like

659
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:29,376
Like an old recording of a violin because it's going through that diaphragm and Hornet has a little bit of a

660
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,656
Electro-acoustic

661
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
Sort of seeming processing

662
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,776
Yeah that's part of it is that like the reason why recording sound that weighs

663
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,800
Because that's what

664
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,336
The old recording horns were like

665
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,104
Able to pay

666
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,432
Pick up and so what this was doing was actually

667
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Amplifying

668
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
The frequencies that

669
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
Like the recording horns

670
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,832
Right toe is sore design

671
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,624
To speak to

672
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,744
The horn that is doing the recording in some ways like it's the it's the analog to match on the other side of it

673
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
To make it even better.

674
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,096
Another thing that it did was it actually like

675
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
The horn

676
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:05,984
It made the sound more directional because all of these musicians had to like

677
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,056
Funnel their sounds like into this like one

678
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,640
Christa corn in the corner of the room it was really helpful

679
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:18,528
When you can have a violin that would point it sound directly at the horn rather than like just radiating out into the room which is like

680
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,064
What the resident body usual

681
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,416
Every little while it was a big deal on the recording industry

682
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:30,816
These designs replied all kinds of instruments Pro guitars Joe cello through mandolin Stroh ukulele

683
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,888
Please and actually a lot of instruments that

684
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,216
Like weren't under the Stroh name but there was just a lot of

685
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,520
Different instruments like from different companies that

686
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
Utilize this design

687
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,848
Instro is the brand name

688
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,176
Lasko is the name of the person who invented the first

689
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,040
John Matthias Augustus Stroh

690
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:56,160
And so were they all manufactured by the company that was destroyed company or is it just a design that was

691
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
Excuse by anybody

692
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,488
Astro violin company in them

693
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,280
They kept manufacturing them even pass

694
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:05,120
Astros death in 1914 his his son picked up

695
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:10,496
Where you left off whenever a lot of articles that were speculating about where it fit in

696
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:15,616
To the broader world of music I like this one in strand Magazine from 1902 that I found

697
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
I was pushing

698
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:22,784
Hard that these instruments were the future

699
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,832
But what is a great importance

700
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,368
Is an entire absence of

701
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,720
This is a point that's so Lopez will value highly

702
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
Immediately it is finished

703
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:40,192
And it will produce marvelous tone and quality of sound

704
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,520
The original violin has been a cherished item

705
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,312
The spirit of invention

706
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,360
Respect no one's prejudices

707
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,664
Amazon actually phone up that all

708
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,712
Fighting underneath with Chara

709
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,576
Kind of a relative to the straw violin

710
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,672
It's okay I see you have one but what would happen to these instruments in the in the larger world

711
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,232
Soho round 1925

712
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:07,328
Electric microphone technology made its way into recording studios

713
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,632
Broader ranges of instruments

714
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,936
Became more possible to capture

715
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
Soba spot of items

716
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
Events no longer like

717
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
You know made the same practice

718
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:22,944
Soda straw violin company slow production and then finally shut down in 1942

719
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:28,320
Can you tell I'm sad about it

720
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,696
And a lot of people write about them is kind of like the silly flash-in-the-pan thing but

721
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,560
We're a really valuable tool for the beginnings of the recording industry in

722
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,584
Without them

723
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,400
There are a lot of Records where violins

724
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,448
Wouldn't have been is present probably

725
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
Studios or I wouldn't have bothered

726
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,312
To record them at all

727
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,384
So after they were necessary because Recording Technology

728
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
Advance

729
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
Did they just come fizzle out as an instrument

730
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
Are there actually still around

731
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:02,880
You can find them and why do you send folk music from Romania Myanmar

732
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:08,000
Shakira yeah destroy violin player is part of her 2010-2011 tour

733
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,304
Resonator guitars

734
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,632
You know those ones with like the partly metal bodies and they got kind of like

735
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,936
Nice designs

736
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,728
So those are the same technology

737
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,824
And one of the inventors of the resonator guitar

738
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
Visited the stroll Factory

739
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
Like in its heyday

740
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,688
And there are a number of articles

741
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Say that

742
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,736
Eustis designs off

743
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
What he saw there

744
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:36,160
So it's still lives on to this day and what is it that you mean you said you're a little sad about it but why are you sad what is it

745
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,696
To do for you what do you enjoy it

746
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,512
I think what I feel sad about is that okay

747
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,584
It's so different than a violin and like

748
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,376
The Strand magazine art

749
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
This is

750
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,728
Like better than the violin and of course you know like

751
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
Violins

752
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,520
Around headband

753
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,544
Prolong timer like

754
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,872
Know better than

755
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:59,456
How many sexy kind of a little bit more limited range by definition

756
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Senna violin

757
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,016
But it has a really kind of

758
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,296
There's something nice

759
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,112
That sound it's a different kind of range of

760
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,416
I just think that like

761
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
It's wonderful to have like

762
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,816
Cool well thanks

763
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,120
Sprinter distance to Bistro Vineland

764
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
Thank you Roman

765
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,776
We're going to take a quick break and I'll catch you up

766
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:27,104
A couple of notable stories in the history of flag redesign

767
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
Catalyzed by the TED Talk

768
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
I gave a couple

769
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:40,160
Between the beeps bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made

770
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
Sound

771
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,304
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

772
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,192
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is in another room and we're all hearing.

773
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
Technology talk to us

774
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,288
It is a creation of Sonic trash

775
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,104
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

776
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,688
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

777
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,736
To make them more human

778
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,832
Turn the living room lights on

779
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
Okay

780
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,416
Dim the living room lights to 50

781
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
80%

782
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Okay

783
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,376
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

784
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,192
Makes for a much more natural experience

785
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
Turn the living room lights on

786
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,824
Dim the living room lights to 50

787
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,104
Resent

788
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:37,760
We're presenting to special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

790
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,832
Is impacting our health

791
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,136

IPic

795
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,608
We need to talk about something

796
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,168
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

797
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:01,568
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

798
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:07,200
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

799
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,480
And you don't know why

800
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,784
Then it may be time to seek help

801
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,856

Flat pocket

805
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,376
So in March of 2015 I did a main stage TED Talk

806
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,144
Talk where I talk to

807
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
About the designer flags and

808
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,984
Mini city flags around the country were

809
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,264
Particularly awful

810
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,800
And I performed it live

811
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
Collider podcast

812
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
And

813
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
I used the voice of

814
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,176
Icelandair extraordinaire Ted k

815
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
Explain his by Design Prince of

816
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,504
Is total blast

817
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:47,136
And what's great is that since then there have been over a hundred flag we designs in the US

818
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,208
It's been fun to watch people engage with their civic symbol

819
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
The new way

820
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,536
Burlington Vermont had an open call flag

821
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,560
Aqua design contest

822
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,096
To replace their coat of arms Style

823
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:01,216
And the competition Was Won by twin 12 year old brothers Owen and Lucas Marcus

824
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,240
It's a white

825
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,056
Green and white zigzag stripe on a blue field

826
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
Very

827
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
Congrats guys

828
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:11,712
A particular note in the flag redesign world is the flag of Pocatello Idaho

829
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,272
Pocatello was voted the worst city

830
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,808
Flag of North America by the members

831
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
North America

832
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
What's the West Coast

833
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,904
And it was kind of the punchline

834
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
APA TED Talk

835
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,720
And after they heard about the talk

836
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,744
Invited me up

837
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
The Pocatello to Spur their flag

838
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,376
And it couldn't have been nicer and more gracious

839
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,912
But a fantastic time there

840
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:36,288
Breakfast with the mayor CBS Sunday Morning came to Pocatello to do in national news piece about their redesign

841
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
I think

842
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Even though I

843
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,360
I was having a little fun with them

844
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,664
The city came away from the experience

845
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,712
Really excited and enjoy the attention

846
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
And best of all

847
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,272
After a year-long effort

848
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,856
I got a new beautiful flag the new flag is called mountains left

849
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
And it has three red

850
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,464
Symbolizing three local Mountains on a field of blue

Series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

902
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,968
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

Might cost you your life

907
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:03,744
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

908
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,840
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

909
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:11,424
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

910
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
A dad

911
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,800
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

912
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:21,152
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main got to know how to do that kind of

913
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,176
I think

914
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:28,576
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

915
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,904
Was found dead in my private gym

916
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,232
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

917
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:39,584
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

918
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,912
Now I need to clear my name

919
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:48,288
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

920
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,312
To find them
