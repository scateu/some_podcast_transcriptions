Roman Mars

21
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,776
We've a little different episode for you today but we have to stop

22
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
The first is an update to the purple Hotel story that was episode number 58 reported by Gwen

23
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,712
Urban sound

24
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,040
Significant changes since we reported that story

25
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,832
So are we one. Day you on that

26
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,928
The first short story that I performed on the radio

27
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,024
Nkw in San Francisco very very early in the morning

28
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,864
But never released it as podcast so I thought I'd share that one with you today

29
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
Here we go

30
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,056
Almond Brown Stroger

31
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
Is an Undertaker

32
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
Of all things

33
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,736
Kansas City Missouri get its first telephone exchange in 1878

34
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,552
Telephone service is good for local business

35
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,856
The funeral business is no exception

36
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
But at some point

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,208
Almond Brown Stroger of Kansas City

38
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:10,048
Notice that he wasn't getting as many calls from potential customers

39
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
He got really suspicious

40
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,960
A friend of the family died and he wasn't even called about performing the funeral services

41
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
The Story Goes

42
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
In the story is

43
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,360
Really hard to verify but I'm going to go with it cuz I really like it

44
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
The Story Goes

45
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,688
After some poking around

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,992
Stroger discovered that the wife

47
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,040
Arrival Undertaker in the area

48
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,576
What's an operator

49
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
The local telephone come

50
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,696
At the time were connected manually

51
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,792
Buy female operators patching lines together on a gigantic punch board

52
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:47,680
Pick up the receiver asking for the local Undertaker in general or even Stroger in particular

53
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
In this case

54
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,800
The unscrupulous operator would only connect to call

55
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
To her husband

56
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
Undertaking business

57
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
Not this Rodgers

58
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
In Stroger

59
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Figured it out

60
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,416
If you were allman-brown Stroger Kansas City Undertaker there are few ways you can go when you discover something like this

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
Number one

62
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,024
Number one for a reason cuz it makes the most sense

63
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,400
You can contact the local telephone company and alert them about the dishonest operator in their employ

64
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,192
Maybe even get her fire

65
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,032
Number to you can take her and her husband to civil court

66
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,336
Sue for damages or something

67
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,896
Borders only option number three

68
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:35,296
You can invent an automatic telephone switching system that allows people to dial each other directly eliminating any need for

69
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
Telephone switchboard operator and thereby completely revolutionising the entire telephone system forever

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Almond Brown Stroger

71
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
The Undertaker

72
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
When with option number three

73
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:57,056
He wasn't the first to come up with the idea but his contact was the first automatic switcher that worked for more than a handful of phones with Anna

74
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
He was awarded a patent in 1891

75
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:07,808
Of course he didn't know how to make the thing he was Undertaker if I haven't stress that enough already

76
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,136
His nephew and some business partners to help develop a working prototype

77
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
It cost more

78
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
It took longer than anyone anticipated

79
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
They finally got it working

80
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,607
And I finally got a chance to try it out in the real world

81
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:26,495
LaPorte Indiana became the first place to have automatic operator free telephone dialing

82
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,335
In a speech at the unveiling of the Laporte telephone exchange

83
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
The cantankerous Brodeur

84
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
Address the issue of the hello girls

85
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,271
Operators who would lose their jobs because of his automated switch

86
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Quote

87
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:45,695
I'm off until the telephone girls will be angry with me for robbing them of their occupation

88
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
In reply

89
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,071
I say that all things will adjust themselves to the New Order

90
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
Water will find its level

91
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,263
Telephone replace the messenger boy at this machine now this place is the telephone girl

92
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,591
Improvements will continue to the end of time

93
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
Strike where they met

94
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,575
The Bell Telephone Company eventually acquired the technology in 1916

95
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,135
In the strowger switch as it was called

96
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,951
Became standard equipment throughout the 20th century

97
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:37,919
So I'm next I'm going to play you episode number 58 again it's called Purple Rain about the purple Hotel

98
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:43,551
Reported by Quinn Maxon and then we can have a really really significant you know it for 5 minutes update

99
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,647
About what happened to the hotel since this was first reported

100
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
So stay tuned for that

101
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,279
This is 99% invisible

102
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
I'm Roman Mars

103
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
The hotel on the very prominent corner of Touhy and Kilbourn Avenue in Lincolnwood Illinois used to be the tap

104
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
China's most famous building

105
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,199
The first Hyatt Hotel in all of Chicagoland

106
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
Premier accommodation

107
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Top Notch rest

108
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
It was Swank

109
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
Roberta Flack stayed there Barry Manilow stayed there Perry Como Michael Jordan stay there on his first night

110
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,279
Find in Chicago every 13 year old boy in the area

111
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
Had his bar mitzvah there

112
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
Hotel was built in 1960

113
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
And it looks

114
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
So if you're wondering how much potentially anachronistic Lounge music I'm going to cram into this episode

115
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
So it's going to be a

116
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Then

117
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
Slowly over time

118
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,415
It became Lincoln Woods most infamous building

119
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
Changed hands

120
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
Got CD and rundown

121
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,863
It was the home of the Midwest fetish fair and Marketplace convention

122
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:06,751
There were drug-fueled sex parties attended by Shady Chicago politicians later convicted of things like

123
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Torsion

124
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
And of course

125
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,359
There was the convicted mobster Allen Dorfman

126
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,663
Who was gunned down in the parking lot

127
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,503
But that's not why everyone in the area knows the building

128
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
If you know nothing of its history it's still

129
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
Pretty hard to miss

130
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
Because

131
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
It's

132
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,231
Really really

133
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Purple

134
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,143
Growing up nearby I always thought it was really really

135
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Ugly

136
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471
Lots of people dead

137
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
Lots of people didn't

138
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
But everyone had an opinion about it

139
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,919
Brooklyn Max infl talking to you now by the way noted SAS public radio host

140
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
You can't resist it,

141
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
She has a secret

142
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
About the purple Hotel

143
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
My father

144
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
Designed it

145
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,767
My name is John Maxey I'm a retired architect and

146
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,815
Former professor at

147
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
UIC

148
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,399
I designed a lot of

149
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Just a building

150
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
Don't interrupt

151
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
I don't have time for the long by odesza

152
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,151
Okay I designed a lot of apartment buildings

153
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
In Chicago

154
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,247
We're here to talk about the purple Hotel

155
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,599
I need you say I designed my name is Jonas. I'm an architect I designed to

156
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Purple

157
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,439
My name is John mexeye I'm an architect

158
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,487
And I was the designer of the purple

159
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Finally

160
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,119
Now you have to understand that when I say the building is purple

161
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,191
I don't mean the kind of purple of saying Iris

162
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Score a plum

163
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
It's purple as an lavender

164
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,383
Lavender purple glazed brick all over pretty much the entire thing

165
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,455
Which needless to say makes it stand out

166
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
Depending on how you look at it

167
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
Like a prized Jewel

168
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
Or sore thumb

169
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
What are the few buildings if you see it once

170
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
You know it

171
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,463
You single forever you can't feel

172
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,839
It is so purple that after it changed hands the new owners renamed it

173
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
The

174
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Purple

175
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Hotel

176
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,215
WBEZ architecture critic

177
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
Wee Bey

178
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,055
I think that it's worth looking at

179
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
Absent the break the brick I like

180
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,943
But I wish you could eat a little Plum last-second filter it out so you don't see

181
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
The Brick

182
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,247
At least in one trip

183
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,319
And really see how the building hold yourself together structure

184
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,439
Good the way that John was able to put the support to the outside of the hotel

185
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:38,559
Get larger floor plates in the middle

186
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,631
And then I get a little mix of green space in the way back

187
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:47,263
So the buildings can I stick together with a lot of good things going on there

188
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
The thing that everybody notices first

189
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
Including architects

190
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Wood beads

191
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,807
I mean I think that if anybody saying that it's not the color that they're lying

192
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
Because you can't really look

193
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Purple

194
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
So it's the only purple building

195
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
Around but then

196
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,375
You know after that initial wave of color hits you you notice really what a great modern a structure that has

197
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Structure

198
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Express tan

199
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,495
Side which is also not something you see everyday anymore

200
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
I think it's a wonder

201
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:26,175
That was Jackie cool founding principle of the architectural firm coo and Associates

202
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
Will get back to her in a minute

203
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:32,063
The first the story of why and how the building got to be so

204
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
Purple

205
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
My dad

206
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
John Mack sign

207
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,207
It was commissioned by the pritzkers

208
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,767
The Benedict family in Chicago

209
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
And it was

210
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
The first Hyatt Hotel

211
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
In the Midwest

212
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
It was called

213
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Hiatus

214
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
Have nothing to do with it

215
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,055
The purple by the way the purple came

216
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:57,663
Because one of the pritzkers A and the big man among the

217
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
Fiskars in the family

218
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
Ask

219
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Color

220
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
Play style I want to use

221
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
And I wanted to use Gray

222
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
Adhesive that's doll

223
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,695
I like something brighter

224
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,255
So I made a mistake of showing him

225
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
The samples

226
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
Books

227
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,119
Having gun in sub

228
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
3540

229
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
Color samples

230
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,239
It sure enough

231
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
Deepika purple

232
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,335
And you don't argue with a n pritzker

233
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,319
My father tells me the story but I suspect differently

234
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,647
He's always gravitated toward bold color choices

235
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:45,535
Our current argument is over bright orange balconies on a building that we always passed he loves them

236
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
And I hate them

237
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,191
When I was growing up his favorite color was blue a color that to me is suspicious

238
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Sisley clothes

239
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
To purple

240
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,543
In fact every house we ever lived in

241
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,359
Brick bungalow summer house in the woods

242
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Suburban Barn shaped house

243
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,967
Mustard colored siding all had bright

244
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
Blue front doors

245
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
That my father painted

246
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,367
My elementary school bus driver used to call me Blue Door

247
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
Upon interrogation

248
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,487
Father coughed up is strange Hungarian logic

249
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
In the near East

250
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,095
That ultimately I come from

251
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,423
The blue color on the doors blue and green

252
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,495
Is to keep the evil spirits away

253
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,543
So that's a reason

254
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,079
I always suspected

255
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
The

256
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
Entrance to the fair

257
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
Houses

258
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,455
Blue to keep the evil spirits

259
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
If it did

260
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Do you think it worked

261
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
Hotel

262
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,135
So you don't think the purple kept away the evil eye from the hotel

263
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Not really

264
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
Because

265
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,279
And that was a murder in the hotel actually there were two

266
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
But I digress

267
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,143
The beauty of that building is the exposed

268
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
Concrete stain

269
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
How to color inside

270
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,287
Pulled out of the structure

271
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Showing

272
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
This

273
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
It's like a human being

274
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
The skeleton will be on the exterior

275
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Partially

276
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,527
That would be weird right now that's that's the

277
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,831
The building is that column set

278
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
Hose.

279
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
The slap site

280
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
Slightly pulled out

281
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
It's a Building B

282
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,023
Reveals its structure

283
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,351
And that is architectural e

284
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
The interesting thing about

285
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Dudley lullaby

286
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
It could be green

287
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Okay

288
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,871
It would be the same good or bad built

289
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
So as an architect I have to ask you

290
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,039
This is a perfect example of

291
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,623
What the what the difference between what the public sees

292
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
And what the Arctic

293
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Absolute

294
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
Because the public sees purple brick

295
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,839
The architect is sitting here saying the purple is so

296
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Unimportant

297
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
In the scheme of the building

298
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
It means nothing

299
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,519
It's just such a tiny thing but to the public that's all it is

300
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,335
That's right because the public is ignorant

301
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,199
Truly ignorant

302
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
Well you can't really argue with him there

303
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,319
But in our defense and I count myself is

304
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
One of the public in the scenario

305
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:24,767
It's really really purple white how far the purple Hotel fell from its original Glory.

306
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:29,375
Dilapidation the murderer the drug-fueled sex parties and a demolition order

307
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,167
It was not torn down

308
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
Time passed

309
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
Economy fell to pieces

310
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,775
Mid-century architecture

311
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
Slowly came back into Vogue

312
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
Mad Men was on TV

313
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
Purple brick was kind of retro cool however dim was starting to shine on the building and its future

314
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,927
Then the purple Hotel was nominated for landmark status a place on the historic registry

315
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:59,583
There was talk of finding a buyer talk of renovation and then while I was searching and interviewing for this

316
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
Dairy story

317
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
Purple Hotel

318
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Went up

319
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,751
For auction there was a lot of Pomp and Circumstance in the beginning of

320
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,823
You know the auctioneer yelling

321
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Saying

322
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
Are you ready

323
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
Booming voice

324
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
And then

325
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Really

326
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
There was only one bidder so

327
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:29,791
And that bitter was Jake Weiss of Weiss properties in Skokie which happens to be right next to Lincolnwood

328
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
He bought the purple Hotel

329
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:36,447
And why why is a shrewd businessman with a Keen Eye and good instincts

330
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
This particular purchase

331
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Was also

332
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,383
A labor of love when you have some of that really is just not realizing of the value and its potential

333
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,759
That is such a prime piece of property it bothers you you know it is part of your neighbors Carter community

334
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,599
And it's something that you really want to see be an asset to the community instead of a blight

335
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
Here comes the love part

336
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,487
Separately from that when my and more importantly I think

337
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,047
We almost lived at the purple hotel for a period of time

338
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
Maya

339
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,167
When my grandfather passed away and my father was saying the traditional Thai Dish

340
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
That's the Jewish prayer for the Dead

341
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:13,311
There was no synagogue anywhere in close proximity to where he lived at the time

342
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,383
And because we're Orthodox when I drive on the Sabbath

343
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,199
That was a little bit prohibitive to say the kaddish

344
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
There's a very

345
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:28,159
Convenient show right down the block so I'm

346
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,463
Every single shop is 4 a year

347
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,767
How we would move into the purple Hotel

348
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,863
Had to accommodate my father's responsibility to say the kaddish for his father

349
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,703
So we lived there for about a year every single weekend

350
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,799
And you know me and my sister at the hotel was our playground

351
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,687
And the architect Weiss has chosen to redesign the purple hotel and bring it back to its original luster

352
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,503
Is Jackie COO of Jackie Cooper and Associates

353
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Also

354
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,343
Former student of my father the original architect

355
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,879
John Maxon

356
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,999
We're looking into is more of a historic

357
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
Restoration of the building

358
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,703
Especially since we have some of the old drawings the original drawings from the 60s

359
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:17,311
And there are a lot of pieces that are still left in the building such as this wonderful

360
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:23,711
Monumental Terrazzo stair with this wood wall behind it I mean you can really see it as a

361
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
Kind of

362
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,623
You know late 50s early 60s kind of Mad Men era

363
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,415
Pan Am sort of

364
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
Hotel

365
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
That really could

366
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,071
Be very current in today's Hospitality environment

367
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,167
That culture today especially in the hospitality Market

368
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:49,567
For some reason purple is a predominant color not necessarily the color of the break but in order marketing I mean you'll look at the

369
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:54,175
The neon lights and the color of the key fob cards and the

370
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,735
Brochures that get printed for some reason

371
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,295
Purple is popping and I'm not quite sure why

372
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,159
Have any of your buildings

373
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Had

374
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
This kind of

375
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,255
History this kind of life cycle

376
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
But you know

377
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
None of them

378
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,703
The same way that a person they go through life and you might go through different Cycles yourself and

379
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,031
Everybody goes through different rebellious x +

380
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,871
Ups and downs I think the same holds true for

381
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:28,479
A property like this that really was a character of itself the building was

382
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,319
Really a product of the environment around it at any given time and

383
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,903
And I feel certain extent the fact that the building did change

384
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
With

385
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
The

386
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,511
Decades and the environment around it

387
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,071
It really is in the building's character

388
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:51,007
And while it's true that this character is building this structure of Nine Lives such empty at The Bowman

389
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,847
Surrounded by board traffic and an empty parking lot

390
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,639
It may just be crouching

391
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:01,247
Gathering is mustard ready to spring back to life arresting that traffic

392
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Filling that parking lot

393
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,831
And spreading like a proud peacock

394
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,879
A purple one

395
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,071
I'd like to thank Redman tail for National Wrecking Company

396
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
For doing all that

397
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Andis company

398
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
To make this a reality

399
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,639
Girl baby

400
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
So

401
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:36,319
It turns out that after all of the gargantuan efforts to save the

402
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
Purple Hotel

403
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
It would have cost

404
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:45,279
40 some million dollars

405
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
Prohibitive

406
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,423
So despite so much Goodwill on the part of so many people

407
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,727
Who wanted to see it survive

408
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
The purple Hotel

409
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
Was torn down

410
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,943
Or I should say is in the process of being torn down

411
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:07,295
Repeat the process of tearing the purple Hotel down began with some ceremony

412
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,879
What everybody can start finding a c we're going to get started

413
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:17,535
On August 27th 2013 the parking lot of the purple Hotel was filled with local dignitaries from Lynn

414
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Lincolnwood Illinois

415
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
Even the mayor was there

416
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
So much for being here

417
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,727
So on the day of the demolition

418
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
It was really

419
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
Really beautiful they had a huge white tent

420
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,151
They had purple flowers they had purple napkins

421
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,967
They gave my dad a purple brick

422
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:42,367
With a plaque on it I mean it was just really really beautifully done and it was a loving tribute

423
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
To the building

424
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,743
At the same time it was a little bit like going to synagogue

425
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,791
Because Lincolnwood

426
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Is a

427
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,959
Predominantly Jewish suburb or at least it was and so all the people who have such strong feelings about the build

428
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,775
Largely we're Jewish

429
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,847
Okay good morning good morning everyone

430
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,663
Thank you all for coming to my bar mitzvah today

431
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,271
But this wasn't exactly a bar mitzvah when John Max I took the stage

432
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:15,391
He said it was a little more like another rite of passage

433
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
So you don't turn around

434
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,512
Which by the way cannot be avoided

435
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Curious Thing That

436
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,400
Architect has invited

437
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,960
Cutting down of his building

438
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:35,360
The typical moment a piece of architecture and a piece of Journalism coincide is when the building is first constructed

439
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,176
This is like riding the biography of a person

440
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,480
What year she is born

441
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:44,064
The real story of how the structure influences the environment

442
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
Peligrosa

443
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,136
Miss fortune changes

444
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
And even

445
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,440
How it dies

446
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,280
Though this wasn't really the end of the purple hotel anyway the wrecking ball took up

447
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,096
Couple of whacks at the building and then they stopped

448
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,632
5 months

449
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,656
To tear it down

450
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,728
Because 75% of it needs to be recycled

451
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,520
As a matter of law

452
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
Brick by purple brick

453
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
They're taking it down

454
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:11,200
So the brakes would just get thrown into a big pile and shipped off to wherever they get recycled

455
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,016
Is there wasn't such a high demand for them

456
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
It turns out

457
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,368
That everybody and their brother wants a purple brick

458
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,440
I was married at that hotel

459
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,000
I lost my virginity at that hotel

460
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:30,400
I used to go to that hotel every weekend with my parents that played in the pool at that hotel I heard Roberta Flack

461
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Quebec Motel

462
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,776
Everybody has a memory associated with it until everybody wants a brick and

463
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,616
I can't even tell you how many people have asked me for a brick

464
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,664
Not the least of which I might add

465
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,040
Was you so badly I'm going to get you at least it's

466
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
It's not a brick

467
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,112
As long as it has some part 1

468
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,440
It will have the iconic purple glaze on it

469
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:01,376
99% invisible was produced this week by Gwen Max ice and Greenspan and me Roman Mars

470
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:06,240
We are brothers 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco

471
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,312
In the American Institute of Architects in San Francisco

472
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:16,992
Between the beeps bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made

473
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
Sound

474
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:24,416
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis talking to me in my

475
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:29,024
Wife isn't another room in a kid is in another room and we're all hearing that voice

476
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,816
Technology talk to us

477
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,120
It is a creation of Sonic trash

478
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:39,776
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

479
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
To make them more human

480
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
Turn the living room lights on

481
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Okay

482
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,760
Dim the living room lights to 50%

483
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Okay

484
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:58,208
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

485
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,024
Makes for a much more natural experience

486
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
Turn the living room lights on

487
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
Dim the living room lights to 50

488
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
2%

489
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:15,872
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sounds

490
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,664
Escape is impacting our health

491
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,224

A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

517
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,808
The body genius is a dark

518
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
Comic mystery

519
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:04,160
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

520
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,696
We're looking the part

521
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,232
Might cost you your life

522
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:12,608
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

523
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:16,960
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

524
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,288
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

525
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
Adad

526
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,664
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

527
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,016
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that.

528
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:36,416
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an actor

529
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,696
The movie called Immortal cop

530
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:44,096
Was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

531
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,376
Even worse

532
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:49,728
The cops think that I had something to do with it now

533
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,776
I need to clear my name

534
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:58,176
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
