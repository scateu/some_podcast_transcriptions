I'm Roman Mars

The most famous architect in American history even if you don't think you know anything at all about architecture

24
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,056
I bet you can take a guess

25
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,848
And I bet your guess would be

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
Right

27
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:26,272
Frank Lloyd Wright Frank Lloyd Wright perhaps the greatest architect of the 20th century

28
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,832
Has been called the Pacesetter of modern-day architect

29
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
One of the most extraordinary men of all time for interview

30
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,304
Sam new ideas in the field of architecture

31
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:44,704
Frank Lloyd Wright left a legacy of some of the most iconic and gorgeous buildings in the United

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
States

33
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,544
Like the spiraling Guggenheim Museum in New York

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,384
The falling water house in Pennsylvania which straddles a waterfall

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,688
And the futuristic Marin Civic Center

36
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,504
Which is the background for Gattaca which is an awesome movie

37
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,296
And that is producer Avery trufelman

38
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
By the end of his career

39
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:05,440
Wright was on a level of celebrity usually reserved for actors and rock stars

40
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
Use a household name

41
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,768
And he was on late night talk shows

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,864
Some quarters of denounce right as an impractical Visionary in the Panthers win

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
Yeah

44
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704
How how do you feel about sex

45
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,776
Mr. right

46
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,664
The right wasn't just known for being a genius architect

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,968
He made headlines because he was a character

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,808
You up and wear this outfit that included up flowy cape in the Hat

49
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
Kane

50
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:37,440
He wrote manifestos launched insulted other Architects and loudly critique politicians

51
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
Religion and Society

52
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,792
Declared himself the greatest architect who ever lived

53
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,328
He was unashamed

54
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,056
I chose honest arrogance

55
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
And Frank Lloyd Wright had this

56
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
Wildly scandalous

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
Private life

58
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
That works against him properties

59
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
Finally divorced

60
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,832
The raw material for big

61
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
Spicy headlines

62
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,184
Frank Lloyd Wright was a darling of The Sensational press

63
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,792
But this bombastic character ultimately change the field of architecture

64
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,608
And introduced a new philosophy of

65
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
F building

66
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,960
Mini of Rights iconic and famous structures were completed

67
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
For the Marines

68
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,872
His most significant contribution to our everyday lives

69
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
With something much more modest

70
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
Small sturdy inexpensive

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
And most importantly

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,344
Very beautiful house design with the American working class in mine

73
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
And it all started

74
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
With a journalist

75
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
From Milwaukee

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,072
1934a Milwaukee Journal reporter

77
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Herbert Jacobs

78
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
Was assigned to take a drive over to Spring Green

79
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
In Central Wisconsin

80
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Who told to write about

81
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Taliesin

82
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
Frank Lloyd Wright's home and

83
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,872
Jacob's didn't really know anything about architecture

84
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,480
And at that particular time he wasn't really interested in learning anything about it

85
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,552
Because Herbert Jacobs had other things on his mind

86
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,112
And that November of 1934

87
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
His wife was very very pregnant

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
The night before his reporting trip

89
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
He brought her to the hospital

90
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
He stayed up with her until dawn

91
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,375
The nurse is a shared Herbert that he could go in his reporting to

92
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
Paper that missing a birth

93
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
And so

94
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
She set out that morning alone

95
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
Larry IDE

96
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
Completely unprepared

97
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:34,431
He drove 120 miles to the chill gray Wisconsin Countryside for his assignment

98
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
To meet with Frank Lloyd Wright

99
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,831
Wright was 67 in 1934

100
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
Couldn't have cared less about his appointment

101
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,439
With Herbert Jacobs of the Milwaukee Journal

102
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Actually

103
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Write forgot all about it

104
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,071
Which wasn't unusual he was known to blow off journalists

105
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,887
When Jacobs arrives at Frank Lloyd Wright's compound

106
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,703
Sound completely distracted by thoughts of his wife and their baby

107
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,031
He learned that the architect was actually on his way out the door

108
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
They got to talk for just over 10 minutes

109
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,127
4 right left abruptly saying

110
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,919
Some of the boys will talk to you now

111
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
The boys

112
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
Where Frank Lloyd Wright

113
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
Princesses

114
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,063
They've come to him from all over the world

115
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,159
And they're part of a fellowship program that right established at his home and Studio

116
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
ICampus he called

117
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Tallahassee

118
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,559
Al Welch word meaning shining brow

119
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:27,167
Welsh because it was built on land settled by his family were farmers from Wales

120
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,519
But The Shining brow also has to do with rights building philosophy

121
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,383
So Taliesin actually is built on the brow just like your

122
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
Brow of your head

123
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
The main Taliesin building

124
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,015
Curls around the side of a hill almost like a

125
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,599
The crown you felt that you should never build on top of a hill

126
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,439
Because I've destroyed the Integrity of the hill this is Floyd Hamblin

127
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
Is an architect

128
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Taliesin

129
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
Also

130
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,839
Part of the faculty of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture and

131
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
Starting as an apprentice

132
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Back in

133
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
1980

134
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
7

135
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,287
Hamblen works and lives at Taliesin full-time

136
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,687
Kieron Frank Lloyd Wright's family land or right used to play as a boy

137
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,247
Where are we we are this is

138
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
Just outside of Spring Green Wisconsin

139
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
It's a very beautiful green

140
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
Valley with Rolling Hills

141
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
So he spent

142
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
A lot of his

143
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
His Summers

144
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,535
Is very familiar

145
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
With

146
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
The landscape

147
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
And this connection

148
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
With the outdoors

149
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,959
Was really formative for right

150
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:38,079
He thought that architecture should help people live harmoniously with their environment

151
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Rather than

152
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
Shield them from it

153
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
The house

154
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
To become part of nature if it was made with local materials and had big windows and was oriented for

155
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
Just the right amount of sunlight

156
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
The Orion

157
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
The house

158
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
Just wright

159
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
So that you've taken

160
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
Advantage of

161
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
What Nature has to offer

162
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
You're living with

163
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
Nature rather than trying to fight

164
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Against it

165
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,655
You know living on the brow of the Hill not on top of it

166
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
It's all folded into a concept

167
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Frank Lloyd Wright

168
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
Called organic architecture

169
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,591
You wanted to spread this gospel to the Next Generation

170
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
Which is why he returned to the valley he knew as a boy

171
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
Established

172
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
The Taliesin Fellowship

173
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,831
Fellowship with the thing that the Milwaukee Journal wanted Herbert Jacobs to cover a news article

174
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:25,183
When Jacobs drove into Taliesin that morning in 1934

175
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
The fellowship had been going on for two years

176
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,303
It was hard for the public to wrap their minds around it

177
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
Including this NBC announcer

178
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,359
Peking is Frank Lloyd Wright

179
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,175
Apprentices are called

180
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,503
Mr. right as the fingers of my hand

181
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,855
The apprentices had to pay $1,100 a year to attend the Taliesin Fellowship

182
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,903
Nearly 20 grand today

183
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,719
And it wasn't like an accredited institution or anything

184
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
Students had to do a lot of grunt work

185
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,815
Baling hay farming fields

186
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
What's and making me off

187
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,911
But they got to learn Frank Lloyd Wright philosophy of architecture

188
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,703
And live with them and work with them

189
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,543
Even though often times has meant serving as an unpaid labor for

190
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,359
When Jacobs was getting his tour of Taliesin

191
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
He described the apprentices as

192
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
Rather long hair

193
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
Smiling and polite young men

194
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,551
Who tried their best to explain to him what Organic Market

195
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Texture means

196
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
Organic architecture is

197
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,463
Architecture of its time and of its place

198
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
You're not trying to make it look like something

199
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
But it's not

200
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,863
Write thought that there should be no wallpaper to cover things up

201
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
Paint no plaster

202
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
Would should look like what

203
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,727
Stone should look like Stone

204
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Concrete

205
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
Should look like concrete

206
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
When Frank Lloyd Wright

207
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:51,967
Worked with plywood he like to leave the edge of the plywood exposed so that you saw those

208
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Players and they are

209
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
And that's became part of the

210
00:08:55,295 --> 00:09:01,439
Almost Florida Mentor detail which was different from freely traditional European style

211
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Architecture

212
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
Withrow Coco gold ornaments

213
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
Parlors full of knick knack

214
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
Just think of Victorian houses

215
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
Stuffed with lots

216
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Tiny rooms

217
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Covered in bright

218
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
Paint them Lacy curtains

219
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,823
This idea of organic architecture wasn't just a break from these traditions

220
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,407
Who's a break from new trends in modern architecture 2

221
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,063
Cities all over the world we're building huge boxy glass and steel structures designed to be hyper

222
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
Sleep machines for living and working

223
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,207
Wright explains that these were simply not comfortable for human animal

224
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,279
I like goldfish and a globe

225
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
And these houses that are so classified as they know how they're not sensible its attributes of privilege Center

226
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,239
An abusive material

227
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:51,103
Frank Lloyd Wright took the traditional old materials and put them into Sleek modern forms

228
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,175
Is organic architecture was a new style

229
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,967
Born in the United States

230
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
An organic architecture

231
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
New sense

232
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
What constitutes

233
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,879
Humanity under harmonious condition

234
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,999
A harmonious place in which to live in a harmonious way to live in it

235
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
But Frank Lloyd Wright didn't

236
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
Playing this Grand philosophy

237
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
To the journalist Herbert Jacobs

238
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
Because right wasn't there

239
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,007
The apprentices did the best I could but again

240
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,311
Jacob's was very distracted

241
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,871
And was only thinking of his wife in the hospital

242
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,455
He thanked the two young man who showed him around Taliesin

243
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
And got back in his car

244
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
Jacob's Ladder Road

245
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Finally

246
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,087
I started back to Milwaukee

247
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,903
Learning on the way to a telephone call to the hospital

248
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,487
That I had become a father at about 11 that morning

249
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
At the very moment

250
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
When I was interviewing right

251
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
Herbert Jacobs

252
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
His wife Catherine

253
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
And their new daughter

254
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,959
Live in Milwaukee for 2 more years

255
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,775
News reporter salary of $20 a week

256
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
This was in the mid-30s

257
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
The Great Depression

258
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:59,711
So when Herbert Jacobs was offered a slightly higher paying job for the paper in the state capital of Madison

259
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
The family moved by the way

260
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,647
How many got the Madison I couldn't find anything within our price range in a newspaper man's price range it was

261
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207
I would we figured would be nice to live in

262
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,767
This is the voice of Herbert Jacobs himself

263
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,583
From a 1956 NBC interview

264
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,423
We can Catherine move to Madison NC any houses they like

265
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
Or that they can afford

266
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
Do something for us

267
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,223
Jacob's didn't really remember much about his first visit to Taliesin 2 years ago

268
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,271
Any murmured something along the lines of

269
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,295
Very interesting

270
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,855
Which his wife's cousin took as a yes

271
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:42,207
But he made an appointment for us to go out there and we went along with that idea

272
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
On the way out we were

273
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
My wife and I were trying to think

274
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
What is it that weaken

275
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
Talus great man

276
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
Architecture

277
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
Rich Brian

278
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
Hercules

279
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
Grease Monkey

280
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,199
In the past when Frank Lloyd Wright had designed private homes they had not

281
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
Ben for people

282
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
Like Herbert and Katherine Jacob

283
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,087
Write a design gorgeous wide homes

284
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
Broad roof

285
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Expensive living rooms

286
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
Wealthy people

287
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
The constructions were masterpiece

288
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
It works

289
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Anywhere expensive

290
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
Show me put it as a sort of challenge

291
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,959
What the country needs is a decent $5,000 house can you build one

292
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,287
In today's money $5,000 is about $85,000

293
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,127
That's a pretty reasonably priced house in most real estate market

294
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,647
Millwright had long wanted to make a more democratic form of housing

295
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Even earlier

296
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,535
Given playing around with inexpensive methods of building and other structures

297
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,119
I need a lot of Concepts that had been scheming around urban planning

298
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
But now

299
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,983
Write have a chance to make some of his Concepts a reality

300
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
She had the Willing clients

301
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
And he had time on his

302
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,663
In 1936 he was in a bit of a slump in his career

303
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
People

304
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
Ford fancy big new homes

305
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
Again it was The Depression

306
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,087
And a number of big projects have been cancelled

307
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,415
And also right had already been practicing for decades

308
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,487
He was slowly getting written off as a has-been

309
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,303
And then in comes this young open-minded couple

310
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
Wright could tell them his philosophy

311
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
And teach them how to live well

312
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
A good architect

313
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,519
Do you really want a $5,000 house

314
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,359
She said most people want a $10,000 house for 5,000

315
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,431
Are you willing to give up the things that you have to give up

316
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,247
Mr. Wright made a list of the things that the Jacobs

317
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
Have to do without

318
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,087
They really wanted a $5,000 house

319
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
Tile bathrooms

320
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,975
Extra trim finishing things like that

321
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,559
We didn't know anything about it we said sure that's okay with us

322
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,399
Herbert and Katherine Jacob's didn't know it at the time

323
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
But that modest little house that

324
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
Frank Lloyd Wright was to build for them

325
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Would be

326
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,311
The most practical expression

327
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Of his ideology

328
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,943
The Jacobs would own the first house in a movement that right called

329
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
Usonia

330
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,807
The house that Herbert Jacobs built was the first of the

331
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,047
Usonia was Frank Lloyd Wright's name for the United States

332
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
North America

333
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,399
In Wright's vision usonia would be a country

334
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Full of malice

335
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
Well made

336
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
Beautiful

337
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,287
Comfortable little houses that the working-class could afford

338
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
These usonian homes

339
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
Would inspire

340
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
Educate and write believed

341
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,199
Create a new culture

342
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
For all Americans

343
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,343
I believe now people are going to know what constitutes good Ark

344
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
A texture

345
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,927
And of course good living has to go with it

346
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
Good Conduct also

347
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
Good dressing to

348
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
Because you wouldn't dress

349
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,655
And I loved and vogelweh and a quiet and beautiful room

350
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,471
All is good things

351
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,543
Independent Wireless one on the other

352
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
I know that something would we call culture

353
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,943
It's only natural girls who can attend coach

354
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,551
Write believe the way to build a better American culture was not on Mass

355
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,111
Not in apartment buildings are cookie-cutter developed

356
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
It was to be catered to the individual

357
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
Kosher not for the crowd

358
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,255
Cultures and individual

359
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
And that's what our forefathers

360
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,215
Band-Aid that individual is

361
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Sovereign

362
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,079
Which two Frank Lloyd Wright meant that the masses should be unmasked

363
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
It should spread out

364
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,687
Away from the city

365
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
Is that

366
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Thing of the past

367
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,063
There was a time during the Middle Ages

368
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
When

369
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,415
Said it was the only source of culture

370
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,487
There's no way of acquiring

371
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,327
This thing we call culture except by direct contact

372
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:10,751
That wasn't true anymore people were connected to culture through radio and telephones and Automobiles

373
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
They have

374
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
Transportation speed

375
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
Listening

376
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
This

377
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
Cherry wood

378
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
Using now

379
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,551
It's no longer essential for people to crowd together anyway

380
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
That was Frank Lloyd Wright's vision for America

381
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
I would start to become reality

382
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,975
In 1936

383
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
But the Jacobs

384
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,815
What she called usonia 1

385
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
Jacob's house was

386
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
One of the first ones built there was this

387
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,727
Put yourself wide open Farmland when it was built out here

388
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,263
This is Bill Martinelli

389
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
Manager of usonia 1

390
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,407
It's in a Suburban Street outside of Madison now lined with little suburban houses

391
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:54,271
But you Sonia one really stands out even if you don't know what it is and you're just driving by

392
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
Because I'm a street

393
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,135
It almost looks like a beautiful wooden wall

394
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
The house trailer

395
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Back on the road

396
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,559
Well when you get inside her if we go around back you'll see that whole back in the house all glass

397
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:11,935
It's all open to the back and he only did that intentionally the kind of close it off to the street and then

398
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
Open it up to the back

399
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,871
As right site the point of the house would love to have a big facade to show off your neighbors with a useless

400
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,175
Wasteful patch of lawn in the front

401
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
Cinegrand entryway

402
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
No

403
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
The house

404
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Should be built for residents

405
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
Not on lockers

406
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,647
Also from the street you can see that there's no garage

407
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,207
Car is parked under a wooden awning

408
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
Just a little flat roof with no sidewalk

409
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
This is the carport

410
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
A term that Frank Lloyd Wright coins

411
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
Well this is the

412
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
Carport of the houses

413
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Considered the first

414
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,543
Named cardboard it was a term that right came up

415
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,127
This was one of the many tiny ways right calf cost down

416
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,199
And also the carport was an education in lifestyle

417
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,295
Without a garage that Jacobs wouldn't have space to store their junk

418
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,391
We have to Simply minimize their possessions and toss what they didn't need

419
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
The carport isn't purely utilitarian

420
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,255
The woodwork on the carport roof

421
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
Has this lovely geometric pattern

422
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Who is like these boys

423
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
Kind of stripes

424
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:18,751
Funny when I get mad heard about the carport and like seeing pictures of it I didn't expect it to be so

425
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
Beautiful in like

426
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
Really nice

427
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
Is house the more you look around more

428
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
Moore UCLA

429
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,479
But the ceiling here than carport you would expect that

430
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,783
Get inside the sea the same thing

431
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,367
Usonia 1 is full of small elegant details

432
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
Sure

433
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Warm in here

434
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
Although

435
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Sun

436
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
Every like the brick in the wall

437
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,471
Here I kind of gets drawn in

438
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
And inside it's pretty much one room

439
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
And loud

440
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Cat

441
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,359
Space is all open no walls

442
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,663
Between the living room dining room kitchen

443
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,783
That's kind of innovative for the time the kitchen is an Alcove at Jason's the living / dining set

444
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Face with no door

445
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
It's a very

446
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
Very tiny area

447
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
This is this is the kitchen

448
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,999
It's just a little bit wider than the length of my arms I think

449
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
But eat football

450
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
8 foot square rug

451
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
Is a small hallway width

452
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
Tiny bedroom

453
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,471
Mostly the one main room is the focus

454
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
That's where you're supposed to eat relax

455
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Read

456
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
Live all together

457
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,615
Again Herbert Jacob

458
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,223
Advocate of the open-plan and housing

459
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,551
Bee removal of a boxes within boxes

460
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
Sort of thing

461
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
You don't have

462
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
The

463
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
Temptation is to

464
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,839
Be together much more

465
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
And it was cost-saving to not have many walls

466
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:55,007
Usonian house is full of these clever less expensive solution

467
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Like the lights on the ceiling

468
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
So that's just

469
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,127
Steel Channel with the wires just

470
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,455
Land in there and then Bears sockets for bulbs

471
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
Let's consider the first

472
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,295
Track lighting another first

473
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
To the house

474
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,855
And now you see track lighting everywhere

475
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,159
Where do you see lights or bulbs

476
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
Fix to a single beam

477
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
That's a usonian invention

478
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,839
Other Innovations usonia popularized include the use of flat roof

479
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
Built-in furniture

480
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
Heated floor

481
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
Herbert Jacobs

482
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,471
Love those heated floors

483
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
No very general

484
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,823
But at that time there were

485
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,383
No floor he did residency

486
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
All of these Innovations Were Meant to help the

487
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
The family LivWell

488
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
Frugally

489
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,295
They saved money while they lived in the house

490
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,831
And they're also save costs

491
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
In the construction of the house

492
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,951
But right you some other cost-saving measure that we're kind of

493
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Cheating

494
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,047
Like he stole some bricks from another building of his

495
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
But he was constructing nearby

496
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
Well right didn't steal the bricks himself

497
00:20:53,887 --> 00:21:00,031
He sent a bunch of his apprentices over to Racine Wisconsin where his design for the Johnson wax building was under

498
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Construction

499
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,127
He told the apprentices to grab as many bricks if they could

500
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,407
And bring them back to Madison

501
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,199
If you're familiar with the

502
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
Johnson wax building

503
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
The corners are curved

504
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
So you can see

505
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
Some of these bricks are

506
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,952
Convex or concave while those

507
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
Like Corner brick

508
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,816
Another way right cap cost down was by taken

509
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Huge

510
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
Pay cut himself

511
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,496
Do I paid was for $5,500 which included Mr rights for you $450

512
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032
By hook or by crook

513
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,056
Brighten it

514
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,872
He met his challenge of building a beautiful house

515
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,920
At Herbert and Katherine could afford

516
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,224
I mean it wasn't perfect

517
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,528
The total adjustment for the family

518
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
In the house have problems

519
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,416
Rain drainage and little things were missing like initially right forgot to put

520
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
Screens in the window

521
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,256
Which one of the kinds of complaints right got a lot

522
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:56,864
He mostly focused on Aesthetics and principles of building rather than practicality

523
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
And ultimately

524
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
The Jacob's house was

525
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Small

526
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,264
At the Herbert and Katherine had two more children

527
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,312
They couldn't fit into the house anymore

528
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,896
I'm so after 6 years of living in usonia 1

529
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,456
The Jacobs family would move off to the countryside

530
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,040
We're Frank Lloyd Wright wood design them a second usonian house

531
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,392
But Herbert Jacobs thought of their first home very fondly

532
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,184
Living in that house was

533
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
Fantastic

534
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,912
Mister Wright thought so too. Everybody should live in a house

535
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
Design by humans

536
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,264
Dishes and clothes

537
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,568
Designed by him and all the furniture

538
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,616
He did design a lot of his furniture

539
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,944
And at least one case he did design a dress for the wife of

540
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
This was all about changing culture

541
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,064
One home at a time

542
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,880
Frank Lloyd Wright wanted to redesign America

543
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,160
And by that token

544
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
Americans

545
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,512
Good design he thought would make a Kinder more beautiful

546
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,048
More enlightened country

547
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
You don't need a guy

548
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,264
You'll know a 1939 right hand Built usonian Homes all over the country

549
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,080
Including houses in Alabama California

550
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,360
Illinois Michigan

551
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
In Virginia

552
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
But he wanted to build more

553
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,808
Do you want to have a central Factory that made prefabricated usonian parts

554
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
Modifiable for each

555
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,904
Client depending on their need for space inside canda

556
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,464
And originally the whole idea was

557
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Ollie's

558
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
Walls would be

559
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
Manufactured in

560
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Factory

561
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,912
That never really happened this is all site-built

562
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,496
Frank Lloyd Wright's Factory for usonian homes never came to

563
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
And

564
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:44,896
It became increasingly clear to write that the $5,000 price tag for usonian homes

565
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,456
Wasn't feasible after the Depression

566
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:52,832
Also writes career picked up shortly after usonia 1 he started getting bigger commissions

567
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
The ones we all know him

568
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,392
Like falling water

569
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:00,768
I'm on the right house is nothing has been more widely publicized

570
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,656
Right worked on usonian homes up until near the very end of his life

571
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
But it was a group of his Apprentice

572
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,008
Harry on his vision

573
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,544
By building

574
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
Haier community

575
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
Usonian houses

576
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,664
Turn right on usonia Road

577
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,736
Dog next after the break

578
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,784
A trip to usonia New York

579
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,600
To see what became of Frank Lloyd Wright's vision

580
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,672
And how these little houses have affected the ways we live

581
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:40,448
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made

582
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
Sound

583
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:47,872
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife

584
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:52,480
Wife is another remedy for all hearing. Voice

585
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,272
Technology talk to us

586
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,576
It is a creation of Sonic trash

587
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,392
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

588
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,976
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

589
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,024
To make them more human

590
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Turn the living room lights on

591
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Okay

592
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
Dim the living room lights to 50

593
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
80%

594
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
Okay

595
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:21,664
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

596
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,480
Makes for a much more natural experience

597
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,528
Turn the living room lights on

598
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
Dim the living room lights to 50

599
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
Resent

600
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:38,048
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

601
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
About how are sounds gay

602
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
Is impacting our health

603
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,424
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

604
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,496
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

605
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,544
Right here on the 99.

606
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,712
Future of Architecture is the future of the human race

607
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
Jordan 1

608
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
FC manager has a future

609
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
It is

610
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
Architecture

611
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,464
Betty's architect Frank Lloyd Wright

612
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,304
Who never shied away from making Grand statements about architect

613
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
Or himself

614
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:17,216
Hey I've been accused of saying I was the greatest architect in the world and if I had said so

615
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,520
I don't think it would be very

616
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
Aragon

617
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,176
Wright believed that the buildings we live in affect the kinds of people we become

618
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
The pace we have

619
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,736
The Comfort we seek

620
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,832
He said that he could rebuild the entire culture of the United States

621
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,136
He claimed that he could change the nation

622
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,184
By changing its architecture

623
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,464
I didn't say that

624
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
And it's true

625
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,840
Amazing but I could do for this country

626
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,144
And a big part of his plan

627
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
Is philosophy

628
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
Proposed building system

629
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
Was called

630
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,032
Usonia

631
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,824
Carrigan is Avery trufelman

632
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,104
Rights ideas

633
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,968
It's about living in harmony with nature using organic materials in a modern way

634
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
And creating

635
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:05,600
Affordable Democratic housing had inspired a new generation of Architects

636
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
So much so

637
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,720
That they would go on to found an entire community

638
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,512
Based on right in principle

639
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,584
Turn right on usonia Road

640
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,424
Nestled in leafy Hills near Pleasantville New York

641
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,216
About an hour north of Manhattan

642
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,520
The little village called usonia

643
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,080
All the homes have low flat roof

644
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,384
They're tucked away into the trees

645
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,944
So you can hardly see them on my summer days

646
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,016
It almost looks like some sort of Star Wars planet

647
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,808
Fit for Suburban Ewoks

648
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,136
There's no big welcome sign no gift shop for leaflet

649
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
In the middle of a community

650
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,208
There is black

651
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,000
Usonia homes

652
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:50,400
The Cooperative was founded in 1944 by idealistic young families to pursue the dream of owning a modern affordable

653
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,704
Home in the country following World War II

654
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,080
The Cooperative was started by a couple of right disciples with studied at Frank Lloyd Wright School Taliesin

655
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,384
Was notably a man named David Henkin

656
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
And although right would be involved with the project

657
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
It was hanging who died today

658
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
As the black size

659
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,576
This land was acquired in December 1946

660
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,136
An April 1947 Frank Lloyd Wright

661
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,416
Supervising architect

662
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,952
Set the unique site plan

663
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,304
A site plan put 40 some houses on circular properties

664
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
Without fences

665
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,144
So that the property boundaries would flow into each other

666
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,240
Homes wouldn't be on little square box with white picket fences

667
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:32,640
David Hinton and his family look for other similarly minded people who could come and join their community in investing

668
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,456
Among those idealistic young people

669
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,992
Was Roland reisley

670
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,064
He and his wife had just been married in 1950

671
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,624
We had no money we had no children we

672
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
We're both only children

673
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440
We wanted to

674
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
Play Darude Sandstorm a family

675
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
And we heard

676
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,560
From a friend

677
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
That does a

678
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,888
Community in Northern Westchester

679
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,936
Building affordable homes

680
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
Supervised by Frank Lloyd Wright

681
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,288
This building project had a communal mortgage

682
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,336
They would pay for the houses together

683
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,640
On land they all owned

684
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Chicago Opera

685
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,688
Let's take a look

686
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Curious

687
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,528
I wake him up here and they were already

688
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,320
Henry 11 homes that were

689
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,392
Nearest nearing completion or beginning to be occupied

690
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:21,792
We were welcomed with open arms and the enthusiasm of the people who are here and talking about their project was in Fair

691
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
Directions to wework

692
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,376
We decided that will join the community

693
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,448
But it wasn't all a big romantic adventure

694
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
It was a real risk

695
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
First of all

696
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
Fish with radical

697
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,128
Nothing these days it's called mid-century modern

698
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,432
But the architecture then was Radical

699
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:45,088
Meaning these homes were so strange looking to the larger world that the people who chose to live in them we're seeing a

700
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
Is radical

701
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,904
And in some ways they were

702
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,208
Some of them were Lefty Jews from the Bronx

703
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,768
Socialist ideals about land ownership

704
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,328
The true cooperatives that we were

705
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
What is radical

706
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:01,216
Operators in the sense that no one owns their house

707
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
Also this was a Financial Risk

708
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
Since the houses were not as cheap as they were supposed to be

709
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,896
They supposed $5,000 cost

710
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,200
But turned out it was not a realistic number

711
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:16,320
During and after World War materials and labor became more expensive

712
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,880
The building of usonian homes involved

713
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:23,232
Special skills and custom fixtures and the house has ended up being double or

714
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,512
Triple their price estimate

715
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,328
Please house was over twenty Grand

716
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,376
But the members of usonia

717
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,912
Would not be deterred

718
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,496
We were determined to go forward with this we were all very optimistic

719
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,336
Here we come occasionally the city's house under construction

720
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,128
You got to come and see you in the same to you

721
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,736
When Rowland and his wife signed up for the community

722
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:48,576
They thought they'd work with one of the Taliesin graduates to design their house

723
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:53,440
Not the master himself we didn't dream of a project Frank Lloyd Wright's I mean really

724
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,024
Who who is 31st

725
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,864
But Frank Lloyd Wright did in fact want to design Rowlands

726
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:07,776
They met up in New York and they exchanged letters and ideas about the plans on Roland went out to see right at Taliesin

727
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:13,920
Who is the real person you could talk to him you could exchange a joke I mean people people don't don't see him that way

728
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,456
But they're there was

729
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,992
Roland was 26

730
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,040
Wright was 83

731
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,832
Come on rolling sit down

732
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,392
You're my client I'm your architect

733
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,464
I'll redesign your house as many times as I have to

734
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,768
Until I was satisfied all of your needs

735
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,072
You have to speak up if you don't you'll take what you got

736
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:37,472
Roland's house would be one of three and usonia New York that Frank Lloyd wright-designed himself

737
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
About five years after the rise lease moved in

738
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
When will when is wife

739
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
Kids

740
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,384
Frank Lloyd Wright added an extension to their house

741
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,408
In fact

742
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,224
Roland is the last living owner of a

743
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,528
Frank Lloyd Wright usonian home

744
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
Dealt specially for him

745
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
And he still lives in it

746
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
I came to realize

747
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,976
After 7 years living here

748
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,328
It did not been a day in my life when I didn't see something beautiful

749
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,936
Even the terrible days that occur in every life

750
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,264
The house is completely usonian

751
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
With simple carport

752
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:18,944
And Sumptuous wooden walls that almost glow and one big main room in a tiny kitchen

753
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:25,088
It almost feels like you're outside because it has these big glass windows with long roof overhangs

754
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,368
To draw the eye out

755
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,440
Towards the thick forest of trees just outside

756
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,976
I think that it has

757
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
Had an effect on me

758
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
I'm anyways

759
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,144
The neuroscientist say that that kind of sense

760
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,448
Reduces stress and that is

761
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,240
Good for your good for your love

762
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,616
And maybe good physical health to I'm 92 years old I'm pretty good shape for 92

763
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
Also

764
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,200
Hardly I mean

765
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,760
Who knows I'd like to attribute that

766
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,296
To experience

767
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
Beauty around me

768
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,904
For most of my life which is car tomorrow

769
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,488
Is Rowland season

770
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:09,888
Frank Lloyd Wright's idea that better architecture could create a better way of life has been entirely true

771
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,216
We could depend on each other if there was a problem or need

772
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:19,872
The kids will know all that wealthy adults by their first name used to say that children growing up here at 5th

773
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
The answer to Uncle zhenya Sonia

774
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,224
The first 40 Years of usonia New York

775
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,296
Only 12 of the 48 houses changed hands

776
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
6 of those two Next Generation

777
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
Members of the community

778
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
There are only two divorces

779
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,488
I have the job they could they couldn't decide who get the house

780
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:40,352
But life started to move at different Paces for people living in usonia

781
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,168
Suddenly they weren't all new young families

782
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,264
Are all groups of people in different phases with different needs

783
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:53,152
And when it was time for homes to change hands perspective buyers were thrown off by The Cooperative nature of the village

784
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,248
In the first Decades of usonia members didn't own their homes

785
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
We decided

786
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
Very relaxing

787
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
2

788
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,136
Grants title to the individual home sites

789
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
To each member

790
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,208
While retaining all of our

791
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Common land

792
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,256
As a cooperative

793
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,328
And that made a big difference that suddenly paperwork

794
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Wellington

795
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,472
If you're not Roland reisley and your house Wasn't custom-built for You by Frank Lloyd Wright himself

796
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,544
Usonia houses can be a bit of an adjustment

797
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,128
Today most of the homes in usonia New York have been expanded

798
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,480
Any and all new additions have been built in a usonian style

799
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,784
Using local materials flat roofs

800
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
Big glass windows and radiant Sensibility

801
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,136
They have to be built that way

802
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:40,768
While the outsides are not Landmark they are governed by the board of usonia the insides are not at all

803
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,608
This is Evan Kingsley he's one of the newcomers to usonia

804
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,168
Relatively he's been there since 2003

805
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:53,568
But I think for the most part those of us who have chosen to move here are really sensitive to the aesthetic of the interior

806
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,456
But there's one specific part of the Interior that has changed in a lot of the usonian home

807
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
We've completely redone the kitchen

808
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:07,648
As was the case in most usonian homes the kitchen in Evans home was this little alcove

809
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,720
Very efficient in very very telling

810
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:15,328
Right never realize that the whole family might actually want to hang out in the kitchen

811
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,168
Nowadays it's as much a place to gather at the living room or the dining room

812
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,032
Evan is added new tiling and appliances and expanded his kitchen

813
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:29,920
But not by much

814
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,968
10in they are that's all that we gain

815
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,736
I'm doing that

816
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,368
There are a smattering of usonian homes throughout the United States

817
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,184
Some design by write-in some by his apprentices

818
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,744
But all following the same basic principles

819
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,536
And like Evan kingsley's home

820
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:49,120
Many of these other usonian houses are hard to modify

821
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:54,240
Because they're often governed by Boards were trying to preserve them as historic pieces of architecture

822
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
And also

823
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,896
Donors themselves want to make sure they keep within the principles of the house

824
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
If you don't have cabinets

825
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,456
Up at the top

826
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,784
They weren't put there in a few could Adam

827
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
Violate the principles

828
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,816
That's Betty and John Moore

829
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
They live in Wisconsin

830
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,632
In the house called Jacobs

831
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
Is 2

832
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:26,496
It's the second usonian house that right designed for that journalist Herbert Jacobs

833
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,056
Yeah well you want to make sure that

834
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
You

835
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,920
Can adapt to the house because it's not going to reject teeth

836
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
Yuan

837
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Much

838
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,320
Like most usonian homes Jacobs to add a carport

839
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,368
Big windows and open plan

840
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,928
In concrete floors with a heating system in it

841
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,976
The floor is nice and cool now

842
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,560
But the weather is nice and warm

843
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:55,680
I mostly wanted to play that clip because I love how Betty and John actually complete each other sentences

844
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:01,312
Betty and John's house needed a lot of attention which is why it was on the market for 4 and 1/2 years

845
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
Before they bought it

846
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,128
Everybody wanted to look at it

847
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,176
It's a curiosity but nobody wanted to live here

848
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,504
If they're really not for everyone

849
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,088
The reason they sit on the market sometimes for so long

850
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
That's because

851
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,392
People consider them

852
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,696
A difficult living

853
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:24,096
That's John eifler an architect in Chicago who has restored a number of Wright houses including usonia 1

854
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,680
In order to preserve them you sometimes have to modify

855
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,496
In order to make them more lovable

856
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:36,128
But even experts like eifler have a tough time keeping track of how many usonian homes exist

857
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,688
So how many are there I don't know

858
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:45,344
I've heard numbers ranging from 27 to 140

859
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:50,208
It all depends on your definition of what an authentic usonian house is

860
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,000
You could consider usonia

861
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,304
Period in Frank Lloyd Wright's life

862
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,912
Period in American architectural history which would include the houses by the apprentices

863
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,728
Or just a general architectural style

864
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
Depending on your definition

865
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,592
The number of usonian houses continues to grow

866
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,128
In 2013

867
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,920
A new usonian house was

868
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
On the campus

869
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,224
Florida Southern College

870
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:17,344
It was a design of Rights from 1939 but constructed 74 years later

871
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,136
All according to rights

872
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
Plans and Principe

873
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:26,304
Usonia certainly never came to pass in the way that Frank Lloyd Wright originally envisioned

874
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,376
With every American living in an affordable car

875
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Custom home

876
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
In fact

877
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:34,752
Elements of the usonian home ever evolved into something else

878
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
Entirely

879
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:40,128
So it is kind of true the boat that usonia directly influence the development of the Rancho

880
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,664
Without a doubt

881
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
I think so

882
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:47,040
Ranch style houses are all over the country

883
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
And nearly every suburb

884
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,368
They are horizontal

885
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
Close to the ground

886
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
One story

887
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,464
They have an open floor plan

888
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
Few walls

889
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,048
So it's not hard to see the similarities to

890
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
Dystonia

891
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,888
Ranch homes are generally less inspired

892
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,936
I don't have the elegant details

893
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,704
Lemonade with

894
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
Standard materials

895
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:12,128
Right might not have been pleased the concepts of usonia I got absorbed into

896
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,456
Essentially the epitome of cookie cutters Suburban housing

897
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,480
At least

898
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:22,880
These houses really were affordable for the middle class unlike all the usonian houses after usonia 1

899
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
Afterwards

900
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,464
American suburbs were full

901
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Aranto

902
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,048
There weren't that many variation

903
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,328
After the war

904
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,120
And

905
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:33,888
Dave

906
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,192
Suburban ranch home was pretty much

907
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
I mean that

908
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
Humongous mansion

909
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
Or something that everyone was

910
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
Living in

911
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,968
Ranch homes in Suburbia I was a very prevalent

912
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
1000

913
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:54,112
Frank Lloyd Wright died in 1959 at age 89

914
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,696
3 years after finishing Roland reisley house in New York

915
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:02,048
He died having created an american-style for Home Building

916
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,864
In which natural wood bricks

917
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,888
