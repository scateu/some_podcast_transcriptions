00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,208
In 1999 a nature documentary about wolves

Call

33
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
Wolves

34
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
Came out in IMAX theater

35
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,864
Miss alpha female is searching for a damn sight

36
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,680
It isn't merely a personal choice

37
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
But her decision will be

38
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Determine the disk

39
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:51,104
Film documents the reintroduction of wolves Across the Western United States

40
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
That's pretty Sir Edmund Fitzgerald

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
And it has everything you want in an eighth

00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736

Wolf puppy

48
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,840
The film was designed to combat

49
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:17,216
The misinformation campaigns of the ranching and hunting love is

50
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,544
Which portray wolves typically is vicious

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
Killers

52
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,872
Fit only for elimination

53
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
That's Chris Palmer

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
One of the film's producer

55
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,784
Team to rehabilitate the Wolves image

56
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,600
By showcasing the relationships within a pack

57
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,208
Rather than just a bunch of scenes of wolves are ripping Caribou to shreds

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,560
They wanted to show the animals working together to raise a litter of

59
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
On gold

60
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,400
Was to show

61
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
Close-ups

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
All the Wolfpack

63
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,752
Interacting in complex

64
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
Subtle

65
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
Waze

66
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,664
Filming the intimate lines of wild wolves is

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Virtually impossible

68
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Because they do not

69
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
Tolerate the presence of people

70
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,368
Still they filmed inside a wolf

71
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,904
And in the Finish movie

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,464
Viewers are let into this private moment

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
As wolf pup

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
Cozy up

75
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
Against their mother's belly

76
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,888
Because newborn pops have no way to regulate their own temperature

77
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
Their mother's body

78
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
The only thing that keep

79
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,800
When the sun came out Palmer went to some screening

80
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
Where audience members could ask question

81
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,408
And often wonder screening

82
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,504
Someone in the audience asked me how do you film The Amazing shot

83
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
Of the mother wolf

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
And it's

85
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
Did

86
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
Palmer's heart sing

87
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,464
Because the truth about that intimate scene in The Wolf Pen

88
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
Wasn't pretty

89
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Cover your ears

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
We rented

91
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
Captive wolves

92
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
We rented captive wolves

93
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,032
The shots of the puppies in the den were not filmed in the wild

94
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,104
Instead the film crew had gone to a game farm

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,152
Where the Wolves were more used to humans

96
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,224
And built an artificial Den with cameras inside

97
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
I was suddenly

98
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Bearing

99
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
Stockley

100
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,904
As an ethical dilemma for myself did I tell

101
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,024
The truth and answer truthfully that for betraying our trade secrets in filmmaking

102
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,887
Did I continue to lie and pretend of the captive wolves

103
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,471
In fact what we want when they want

104
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Homer decided to

105
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
To come clean

106
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,079
And when I did this I could

107
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,639
Feel the audience's disappointment

108
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
And this moment was a bit of a turning point for him

109
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,783
Up to that point I think I kind of assumed but why would they care

110
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,415
But they do cat people do cat when people watch documentaries especially science space documentaries

111
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:51,071
They are assuming they are seeing the truth they are seeing things that are authentic and Jen

112
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
Inuits and truthful

113
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,167
And when they find out that is not the case

114
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
They get very upset

115
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,799
Of course there's some level of allusion in all films

116
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
You're editing footage to form an area

117
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,431
We do this and Radio 2

118
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,783
But Illusions in Nature Documentaries exist on a spectrum

119
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,367
In some cases these allusions help tell the truth

120
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
About animals

121
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,183
But in others

122
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
Not so much

123
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,535
On the far end of that truth Spectrum you know

124
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
Over toward the straight-up false and

125
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
Is a film called White wilderness

126
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
I still remember watching

127
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
Willis as a child about 11 years old

128
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,127
It was a documentary produced by Disney in 1958 about the high Arctic

129
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
Land of many Mysteries

130
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:43,039
It's a strange fact that the largest Legends seem to collect around the smallest creatures

131
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,367
One of these is a nasty little rodent called the Lenox

132
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:53,791
In one scene of herd of tiny Lemmings approaches a rocky Cliff along the ocean

133
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,863
Reach the final precipice

134
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,655
This is the last chance to turn back

135
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,239
The little fur balls Pier over the edge

136
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,055
And then they go

137
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
Epsom salt

138
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,151
Show me Arctic sea is dotted with tiny bobbing.

139
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
It's dramatic stuff

140
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Except

141
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,063
This entire sequence was staged

142
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
The producers

143
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
Went the Arctic

144
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
Bagged up a bunch of lemon

145
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,511
And flew them to this Cliff along a river in Alberta

146
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,839
And they put them on a turntable That You Don't See in the film

147
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,911
Elladan and they threw them off the cliff side into the water

148
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
And films it

149
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,263
And Lemmings don't actually hurl themselves off cliffs

150
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,919
Some lemon species do experienced dramatic fluctuations in population size bleeding to some creative 19th century

151
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,223
Three hypotheses about what might be going on

152
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,551
But the idea of a mass lemming suicide ritual

153
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
Is entirely apocryphal

154
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,159
White Wilderness didn't invent

155
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
The lemming suicide

156
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,999
But it certainly helped to spread it

157
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
The film was seen by millions of people

158
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
I even won the Oscar

159
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
4 best documentary

160
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,215
Everybody is learned that from that film and it be misled by Sophie

161
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
What we put in these films is important

162
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
And that means

163
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
So important they are

164
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
Made

165
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:18,015
Not only entertaining lie but made I'm accurately and an ethically because they do have an impact

166
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,623
The lemming scene is an especially egregious example of dishonest film

167
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,463
But smaller acts of deception happen all the time

168
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,791
And after his experience with the wolf documentary

169
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,351
Chris Palmer started looking into this stuff

170
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
He found filmmakers learning sharks

171
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447
Closer to the camera by dumping bug

172
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
It's a fish guts into the ocean

173
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,079
And a producer using CGI to edit a sea otter into a shot

174
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:48,479
Homer is particularly bothered by filmmakers that harass animals to try to get them to do something exciting

175
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,319
He thinks all this happens because of a race 4 rating

176
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:57,951
And when you focus so so much on Resler that you inevitably

177
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,743
A move toward pregnant

178
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
That are highly sensational

179
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:08,191
And overly dramatic a lot of Palmer's criticisms have to do with the visual side

180
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,591
I feel making but any conversation about the accuracy of Nature Documentaries inevitably ends up on the topic of sound

181
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
That's because in most Wildlife films The Sounds you hear were not recorded while the cameras were rolling

182
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,831
Which makes sense if you think about how different the two technologies are

183
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,695
Most filmmakers use really long telephoto lenses

184
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
The phone animals from a safe distance

185
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,583
But there's no Sonic equivalent of a zoom lens

186
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
For good audio

187
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,703
You need to get a microphone really close to the source of the sound

188
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:46,079
Which can be difficult or dangerous to try and pull off all the cameras are rolling

189
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,383
You can't just walk up to a lion

190
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
Clip a lapel mic on its main

191
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
And so many of the subtle movement sounds a chimpanzee rustling through leaves or a hippos

192
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
Squelching in the Moc

193
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,415
They don't come from animals at all

194
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
They're made by Foley artist

195
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
30 Oz is job is to

196
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Basically

197
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Home

198
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,583
Lula

199
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
Movements

200
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Queer film

201
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Essentially

202
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:15,007
This is Richard Hinton windowless room

203
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
Watching television

204
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Making

205
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
Weird Science Reynolds

206
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,199
Clinton performs in a studio with trap doors in the floor

207
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
And underneath the floor you have

208
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
6 pics

209
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
HBO with a different material

210
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,671
Foley artist spend so much time playing around in these pits

211
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
That they call each other pitmon

212
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:39,327
Is this one gravel once filled with sand ones.

213
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
I want kind of desk and grass

214
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
Elements of solid science lab

215
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,239
Which pet is mic'd up for high-quality sound

216
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,335
Hinton watches a silent version of the scene on an HD screen

217
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,407
And he tries to match the movement of the animal

218
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,967
Usually on on Sat On The Floor

219
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Cross-legged

220
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
And I'm kind of blunt

221
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
So I can control my weight

222
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
I need my wife

223
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
I'm putting into the movement

224
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
He starts with the feet

225
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,999
As the animals move he tries to match their football

226
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Boss with his hands

227
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,863
When you're feeling animals usually use your hands rubbing your feet

228
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
Because you have no control

229
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
If its Hooves out

230
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,335
You know use the tips of my fingers and I'll really driving into the surface so you getting a heart attack

231
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,247
If it's something like a lion then I'll use the flash my fingers

232
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
And you get a mole Patty

233
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:35,647
And I kind of stealthy kind of stoking kind of whites to it

234
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,511
Hinton has been doing Foley for years

235
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
And it's worked on many big nature

236
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
Including planet Earth 2

237
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,727
With all that practice he says he can often get it right in just a single take

238
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
I've been doing it long enough now to know

239
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
You know that point

240
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
Chase is about to go from a stool

241
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
Swiss print

242
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
Because of its shoulder move

243
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,503
Adjust the weight pins his back

244
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
You know the more of this stuff

245
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,135
But you do you stop picking up on these little visual Clues

246
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
The wild life gives you

247
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
In terms of what it's about to do with its Behavior

248
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,559
So many Wildlife films focus on the exact

249
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,863
Same cast of Marque species

250
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Elephants

251
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,679
Leopards crocodiles

252
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,031
But hidden rarely comes across footage of an animal he's never fully before

253
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
When you first come across something you haven't done

254
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,735
You do spend a couple minutes just just watching the pussies three saying right okay well how is this thing moving

255
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
How

256
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
Yeah it wants its rhythm

257
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,855
Hazard shoulders working in relationship

258
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Sweet Street

259
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,647
For more

260
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:44,767
It sounds as a giant storage area full of materials he's hoarded over the years

261
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Sheets of metal pieces

262
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Rubber

263
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Different types

264
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Rope

265
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
Wetsuits

266
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,703
He takes out a couple of items to

267
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
In front of me right now I have

268
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
Some hot wings

269
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
Which was actually just provoke gloves

270
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,455
Interesting if he's the fingertips

271
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
You get back wings

272
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
Detroit the movie

273
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Reasonable

274
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
London

275
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
You got pigeon wings

276
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,023
To mimic the sound of an animal walking on snow

277
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,327
Continues has a bag of dried

278
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Custard

279
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
When he squeezes the bag

280
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
You got that fresh snow

281
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Crunch

282
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,151
Sometimes he brings in natural materials from the outdoors

283
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
The studio has a big Garden

284
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
And in the summer Peyton will harvest different plants

285
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
How to use

286
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Set recordings

287
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
The Winter though can be more challenge

288
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,695
What will quite often do is we'll use small tape

289
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,791
Here I have a combination of Sunoco syringe type

290
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
Smok V8 chest tight

291
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
It's like it was kind of leaf canopy

292
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Work

293
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
Something like a baboon or chimp

294
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
I'm a question about

295
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
Foley artists share techniques

296
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,855
And some tricks have become so ubiquitous

297
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,951
That they've actually changed our understanding of the way nature sounds

298
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,279
I mean this is the thing we've been thankful you're not restricted so long

299
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,375
People actually are used to listening to is how we fight Easter

300
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,239
Which is kind of weird some people expect what we do brazas and what nature money

301
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
Actually there in real life

302
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
For example

303
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Elephant feet

304
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:39,455
We expect to hear a big booming sound when a massive elephant foot hits the ground

305
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,783
But that's not what elephants actually sound like

306
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
Have you told anybody that works around Dallas

307
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,695
They will tell you that elephants make pretty much no sound at all when they walk

308
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
Because the Departed

309
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,535
Sodalite section of that foot is just one big

310
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Foxy plushie

311
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
So

312
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
They're incredibly efficient

313
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
Distributing the whites as they walk

314
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,031
But Hinton says that if you had no sound at all it would just

315
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Fuel

316
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Weird

317
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,639
It's very uncomfortable to see a foot

318
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
The song Enough

319
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
Telescreen in hit floor and O'Hara sign for

320
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,527
Hinton tries to find a middle ground

321
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,855
Between accuracy and giving people the sound they expect

322
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:24,511
But he says the main goal of Foley is just to provide a little bit of that movement sound need

323
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
The help the film

324
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,839
Slow movement sounds at one thing

325
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:33,983
But then there's the distinctive vocal sounds an animal makes you know a lion's roar a cuckoo birds

326
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
Cuckoo anything that you would

327
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,103
Termites vocalisation is a growler grunt

328
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,431
Scream a rule the bad Cole

329
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
It's okay to be as real as we can get it

330
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
But just because it's

331
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,111
Your it doesn't mean that you're hearing the exact same individual animal

332
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
But you're seeing on the screen

333
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:57,023
Unless you can see David Attenborough in kneeling next to an orangutan

334
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,095
Chances are the sounds that orangutan is making

335
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
Come from a different orangutan all together

336
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:10,079
Mini sound Studios have massive carefully catalog libraries of animal recordings that sound editors will use

337
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
To match the specific behaviors seen on screen and sometimes filmmakers will hire sound recordist to go out

338
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
Out and find sounds to fit their film

339
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
Recordists like Chris Watts

340
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,903
My name's Chris Watson and I'm a sound recordist

341
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,719
Watson usually gets a storyboard from the filmmaker

342
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,559
And it's his job to go and find sounds that match different scenes

343
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
He's working on a lion seeking

344
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,935
Watson will find a pride he wants to record

345
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,983
And carefully study their

346
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
And then realizing

347
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,615
You know when they're off hunting or when they're gone to another location

348
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
You lanco Radio Moscow

349
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
Two phones

350
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
Close by where you saw them

351
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,295
I usually very long cables

352
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
Anaheim

353
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,623
Conceal or disguise microphone

354
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,487
Near the source of the sound Ben Watson climbs into a hiding place

355
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
A safe distance away

356
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
And weights

357
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,607
He might take you two days but then it eventually

358
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
Stop Pride

359
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,983
3 for females in 9/10 it doesn't Cubs

360
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
Will come by today

361
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Place

362
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
I'm just laying down watching TV microphone

363
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Stop vocalizing

364
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,807
Watson takes big predators like these very seriously

365
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,927
He has all kinds of techniques for getting close up sound without getting too close

366
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,743
Do you want to use a really long boom

367
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,559
Take it as microphone near achita resting beneath

368
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
The tree and I

369
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,911
Over by an hour or very slowly

370
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
Lowered

371
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
The boom down

372
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
Choosing a bow

373
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,055
3 ft to this animals

374
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Had

375
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
Havana recorded

376
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Remarkable

377
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Close up

378
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
Purring sound

379
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
Which wasn't even notable

380
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:58,111
But we were 1012 Yalta way

381
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:09,375
What's an ulcer record lots of ambient sounds and then he sends it all to the editors who carefully piece together an Acura

382
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Soundscape

383
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:15,263
In the final product it looks like the vocalizations are coming from the animals on screen

384
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,639
When you can though Watson does try to record sound while the cameras are rolling

385
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
Synchronous sound is not impossible

386
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Pieces

387
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,527
And I can bring a special kind of realism

388
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
The film

389
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,599
In the BBC documentary the life of bird

390
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,903
The director asked him to make up a bunch of

391
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
Trees and bushes

392
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,999
I swear he new song birds like the sing at dawn

393
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
And it worked

394
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
The bird showed up right on cue

395
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,655
And saying right into his tiny microphones as they film

396
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,447
Amelie morning like

397
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
I see the bugs

398
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,775
Brass is exhaled from the song

399
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,735
Recording synchronous sound is much easier with Bluebird than say

400
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
Polar bears

401
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,063
But Watson which has it happened more

402
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,671
He says that in general producers prioritize sites above say

403
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,023
I'll spend millions of dollars sending camera people all over the world

404
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
To get that special shot

405
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
And then just

406
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,143
Worry about finding the right sound later on

407
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:19,007
Sometimes though recording the sound separately can actually enhance the accuracy

408
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
Of the soundtrack

409
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,359
In the BBC documentary life in the undergrowth

410
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:29,503
The filmmakers wanted to Showcase this bizarre behavior of the Alcon blue butterfly

411
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,087
Wood ants mistake these caterpillars for their own larvae

412
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,391
And carry them underground to the end colony

413
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,231
Once inside the caterpillars do something remarkable

414
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,351
Next regulate an internal organ things about 300

415
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,239
I had to look up stridulate to

416
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,127
It means to make a shrill Sound by rubbing the legs wings or other parts of the body to

417
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
In this case it's the caterpillars attempt

418
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,503
Dominica hungry baby

419
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
This sound

420
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Stimulates

421
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Then

422
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
Feed the cats

423
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Capella

424
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
So it's cross

425
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
Species communication

426
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Which is actually

427
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,023
Something very special in the first

428
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,839
The filmmakers would destroy the antonym

429
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
That's if they tried to film this in the wild

430
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,447
So they established a colony inside a film set

431
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,263
And filled it with tiny Periscope cameras

432
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
And the capsule the sound

433
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
Chris Watson use what's called

434
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,639
A particle velocity micro

435
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
Screen record extremely quiet sound

436
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,807
About to go into a BBC Radio Studio very very very

437
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
Quiet place

438
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,159
Bahadis like somebody's cast

439
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Phyllis

440
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
We shouldn't place

441
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
On

442
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,303
Particle velocity microphone

443
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
About the size of a

444
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,375
It might be like it P

445
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,423
Lots of diamonds have a butterfly

446
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
River sounds place on Sauk

447
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,823
And eventually produce this vibration which are recorded

448
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,455
One of the most astonishing

449
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,015
Sounds abysa Behavior

450
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,039
If a witness

451
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,831
It would have been impossible

452
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
To record it under

453
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
Wild conditions

454
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
Pausing videos impossible

455
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
Film The behavior

456
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
Idlewild condition

457
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,863
Was Chris Watts in the sound recordist and Richard Hinton the Foley artist

458
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,191
Work to give us accurate and satisfying sounds

459
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
Albeit in different ways

460
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,055
What Watson says there's something inherently artificial

461
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
In the process

462
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
Cast of making nature sounds

463
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
Nature Documentaries

464
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,479
Are are not reality

465
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
It's the creation of an illusion

466
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
Like any other

467
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
Pics of entertainment

468
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
But a lot of viewers get upset

469
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,719
When they find out that their favorite nature.

470
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
Isn't total

471
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Real

472
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,887
Richard Hinton the Foley artist says he gets reactions like this all the time

473
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,935
And I when I tell people what I do

474
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
For living

475
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,031
Pizza Rizza fascinates you do they want to punch me in the face

476
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,591
Don't punch Richard hit in the face

477
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
I cannot stress this enough people

478
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
Discovering all the work that goes into the final product should not

479
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
Cornish it

480
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,295
Nature Documentaries are still movies

481
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,855
And they need a little movie Magic

482
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,391
Just like any other film

483
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,792
Chris Palmer the filmmaker from the beginning of the story says the most important thing is that the movie Magic

484
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
Is being used to tell the truth

485
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:29,216
He actually thinks that renting wolves like he did to show viewers how they behave in their dens

486
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,008
Was probably fine

487
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,104
Palmer says if he had to do it over he'd likely do it the same way

488
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:40,224
But make it clear to the audience somehow that the scene was not recorded in the wild

489
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:45,600
Homer thinks a lot of documentary filmmakers are doing their best to bring us accurate representation

490
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
Animals in the wild

491
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,440
But he does see one big problem

492
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,488
Even some of the best work out there

493
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
Fails to acknowledge human impact

494
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
Axon ecosystem

495
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,656
Which is giving the impression that we don't have any environmental challenges

496
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
Homer says that a lot of Nature Documentaries.

497
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,080
These days show animals as if they live in some magical fantasy world

498
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,152
Completely divorced from Human civilization

499
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,432
There's no shots

500
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,456
What's the nearby City

501
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,016
Where the coal mine that's encroaching on habitat

502
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:18,624
Either you watch the shows you think it was nothing wrong with the world nothing wrong

503
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,184
Which is its own form of deception

504
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,232
When you make a film about

505
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,024
About the natural world

506
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,888
To admit any mention of the environmental challenges faced by that natural world

507
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,168
Is misleading

508
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,752
But Palmer still believes in the power of good filmmaker

509
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,848
He thinks that if we want to sell big environmental challenges like species

510
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,384
Extinction and climate change

511
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,688
We need compelling true story

512
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,712
About nature

513
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,016
And to tell a true story

514
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
Sometimes you need

515
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
A little fakery

516
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:57,024
99percentinvisible was produced this week by init Fitzgerald with Sharif Youssef

517
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Delaney Hall

00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
Avery trufelman

519
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,608
And me Roman Mars

520
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:05,472
Katie mingle is our senior editor Kurt Kolstad is the digital director and Taryn Mazza

521
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
Is the baroness

522
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,800
All the music was composed by Sean real

523
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,896
We are product of 91.7 kalw in San Francisco and produce

524
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
On radio row

525
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
And beautiful

526
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
Downtown

527
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
Oakland California

528
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:24,416
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

529
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,976
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

530
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
If

531
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:32,608
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

532
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:38,496
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another

533
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,288
Technology talk to us

534
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
It is a creation of Sonic trash

535
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,664
That's Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

536
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,040
Studies how we can improve our interactions with technology to make them more human

537
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
Turn the living room lights on

538
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
Okay

539
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
Dim the living room lights

540
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
50%

541
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
Okay

542
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:07,680
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

543
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,496
Makes for a much more natural experience

544
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,544
Turn the living room lights on

545
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
Dim the living room lights to 50

546
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
Percent

547
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,344
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

548
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,136
Landscape is impacting our health

549
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,696
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

550
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,512
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

551
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Right here

552
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,816
NPI fate

553
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,168
We need to talk about something

554
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:45,568
