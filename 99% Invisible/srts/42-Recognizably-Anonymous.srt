I'm running more

26
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
Hello

27
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,808
We are Anonymous over the years

28
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
We have been watching you

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,648
First off we should describe what anonymous

30
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,488
It's not an organization it is a non organization

31
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,792
What sort of ever-changing Band of individual

32
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,608
Sometimes described as hackers or hacktivists

33
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
Store free expression zealots

34
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:19,520
So are just internet troublemakers you can't even call him a group I tend to call them

35
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
We are anonymous

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,664
And for someone who writes extensively about Brands and brand identity

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,784
Rob Walker became intrigued

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
Magazine and

39
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,904
Because this non group called anonymous

40
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
Somehow created its own

41
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:44,352
Visual identity it was so compelling and immediately recognizable which is a task that corporations are political camp

42
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,912
I think spend millions and millions of dollars

43
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
To achieve

44
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,776
And these people seem to have done something very effective

45
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:57,664
Without any organization or any budget for even any

46
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,760
There are two basic images used for anonymous

47
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,320
What is a logo headless figure in a suit

48
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
Juxtaposed against

49
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
Kind of world map

50
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
Very

51
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
Blatantly derive

52
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
From the United Nations

53
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Globe

54
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
With a?

55
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
The other major visual image is a mess

56
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
Are there is a sort of stylized vicinage based on Guy Fawkes although no one real

57
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
Recognize

58
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Guy Fawkes

59
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,992
Is the mask worn by the protagonist in The Graphic novel and then movie

60
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
V for Vendetta

61
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,344
The original mask design was by the artist David Lloyd

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,928
And it comes in handy when you're trying to stay Anonymous in the real world

63
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,488
And it is sort of bleached over into

64
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
Adjust Street protest

65
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,888
Street protests liking non-affiliated Occupy Wall Street movie

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
Anonymous has its roots in the anonymous postings on these / B / message board on 4chan.org

67
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,480
I would openly discourage your listeners from visiting the / B / message board

68
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Yeah

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
Some things you just

70
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
Can't unsee

71
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
See it's really

72
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,256
Pretty harsh together as a kind of movement when they decide to take on the Church of Scientology

73
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,071
There was an embarrassing video of Tom Cruise

74
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:24,447
That people were posting and people representing the Church of Scientology were taking it down

75
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,383
Anonymous had a problem with that

76
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,711
Because of their kind of General free expression

77
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,343
Point of view and decided that they would band together and keep reposting that video and then

78
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,439
That sort of escalated into what else can we do

79
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,767
To basically cause problems for the Church of Scientology

80
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,839
It was an ominous YouTube video producer

81
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
Buy a small subset of a

82
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
We're more unified voice

83
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
Spaghetti for

84
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,007
I was absolutely blown away by this

85
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,567
It's directed to the Church of Scientology

86
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,871
It's not directed To The World At Large

87
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Attention

88
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Scientology

89
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
We are anonymous

90
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
And here's what we have

91
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Say

92
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
And we're coming after you

93
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,623
And we recognize you as a formidable opponent

94
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
But we're going to take you down

95
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
And the visuals

96
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
It's just sort of rolling

97
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,815
Clouds over buildings

98
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
And this is kind of ominous

99
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,703
Music playing in the background and the voiceover

100
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Is this

101
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
Robot voice

102
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
Which turned out to be an online AT&T tech

103
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
But it sounds really

104
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
There are a few notable moments

105
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Send turns off

106
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,503
The phrase in the video but the first one to grab Rob's attention

107
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,063
We are Anonymous and we're going to do this

108
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
For the good of your own followers for the good of mankind and for our own amusement ind4

109
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
Enjoyment

110
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
It just sort of like

111
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:58,143
Really encapsulates this like we're righteous and we just sort of feel like doing this right now cuz we

112
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
We find it fun

113
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,727
Which is really kind of a scary combination

114
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Of ideas

115
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,335
The video ends with what has become the anonymous tagline

116
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:12,479
And parts of this tagline I learned had been kind of floating around on 4chan at slash

117
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
Splash board

118
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
We are anonymous

119
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
We Are Legion

120
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
We do not forgive

121
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
We do not forget

122
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
Expect us

123
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
Expect this is so like

124
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,047
You know you just almost immediately want to serve freeze up with

125
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
Your keyboard and look over your shoulder

126
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
If they're there

127
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:37,823
Around the same time as this video the apprehension headless suit man in front of the UN flag logo was created

128
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,663
Again using elements that have been floating around these / B / board

129
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
For quite some time

130
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
Elsa created a website

131
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
And all this because

132
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,319
A media Savvy member of anonymous

133
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Warn the others

134
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
But if they didn't brand themselves

135
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Someone else

136
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
Would do it for the

137
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,999
You need some kind of a solid identity

138
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
Setopress

139
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
Because they're going to they're going to come up with their own

140
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
If you don't and you want to control that message

141
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,751
Rob Walker got the inside story of the early days of anonymous from Greg house

142
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
Who is part of the

143
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Early planners

144
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Various

145
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Anonymous actions

146
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
You could say Direct

147
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
The action

148
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
But you know what

149
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
Anonymous everyone knows that you

150
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
You can only make suggestions that if they're good enough

151
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
Don't do it

152
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Ignored in the process

153
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Of being

154
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
Bombastic

155
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
They could tour

156
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Scientology

157
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
They sort of accidentally created

158
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,095
Ominous

159
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,679
Self-image that is simultaneously scary but also very

160
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
So this video that they did took off

161
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,567
Currently it has over four and a half million views

162
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,359
And it decided the next logical

163
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
.

164
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Was Street protein

165
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,759
We decided right then and there that that's what we're going to ask everyone to do we're going to send the internet

166
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Outside

167
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,831
People are leaving their mother's basement

168
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,415
Sort of legal stuff

169
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Church of Scientology

170
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,023
Is really going after 9

171
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
We're going to need to cover our faces

172
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
So we need to

173
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,191
What Mass do we use

174
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,239
He means the V for Vendetta mask

175
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
That's kind of

176
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,567
A Batman mask

177
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,687
Floating that night was old school masquerade masks

178
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,783
Where you would actually hold the little stick and hold it up

179
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,111
And then they got really pragmatic about their choice

180
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
We called around 2

181
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
Comic book shops and cost

182
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,255
Shoe shops in most of the major cities of the world from

183
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Paris

184
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
To London

185
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
New York everywhere

186
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
And we ask

187
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
What do they cost

188
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
And it won't be found

189
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,055
Nearly every costume and comic book shop on the

190
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
Planet

191
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Hadoop

192
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,895
The Guy Fawkes mask

193
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
For 6

194
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
The $10

195
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Sitting on your local currency

196
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
I know it was you

197
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,575
It was okay

198
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
It

199
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,975
Every city in the world not only do we like it but it's the right choice

200
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
Basically up shot is

201
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
Enough people went along with the

202
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
The day after

203
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
Scientology

204
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Photos

205
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Videos

206
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
People wearing this

207
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
All over the

208
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
And

209
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
It just caught fire

210
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
A powerful thing

211
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
Sort of sot

212
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,039
Another quality of the V for Vendetta mask is that

213
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Has its own

214
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,135
Twisted version of a Mona Lisa smile

215
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
That you can

216
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
And quite figure out if he's laughing

217
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
Or mean

218
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:40,095
Or laughing at you in a mean way having fun and Menace

219
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,959
You know it's not really that surprising that those two ideas

220
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,543
It is a statement of anonymity of personal privacy

221
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
But it's also a statement

222
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
Of

223
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,151
Wild freedom of expression

224
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
And

225
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
Absolutely

226
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
Through a combination of Mirth

227
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,159
I asked Rob Walker why he thinks he's too images

228
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,487
The Headless suit man and the V for Vendetta mask work

229
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
He gives two basic reasons

230
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
One is that they're just

231
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Graphically

232
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Pleasing

233
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,191
People up is like what is your empirical proof that this is

234
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
Is good

235
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
I don't really have any empirical

236
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
What I have is

237
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
I look at it and I say that's awesome

238
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,223
And the second reason is that the two symbols are easy to manipulate

239
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
Very

240
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Simple graphics

241
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Program

242
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
You can put

243
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
The Guy Fawkes mask

244
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
Over the Hedge

245
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,463
Why are you can manipulate these things in any number of ways

246
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
Which is

247
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
A strategy that

248
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,303
Traditional

249
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
Say corporate brand

250
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Or political

251
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Wouldn't

252
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
Maybe not be so into

253
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,287
But in this case there was no creative brief there was no set of brand

254
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
And standards

255
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,383
People just seem to intuitively know that you can

256
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,687
Play around with these things

257
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Hand drawn the

258
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Power of the

259
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
But make them your own

260
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
And in the making them your own

261
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
You're doing it in a way

262
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
That rebounds back to the original images

263
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,583
And that's just like the message board meme culture that

264
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
Anonymous to begin with

265
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,191
You can make the images your own and be one of them

266
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,287
Are use it for your own purposes and have nothing to do with Anonymous at all

267
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,847
No one will know the difference

268
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,151
Annies icons and anonymous

269
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
Will live on

270
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:39,903

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

283
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
The bunny genius is a dark

284
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Comic mystery

285
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,367
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

286
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
We're looking the part

287
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
Might cost you your life

288
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:50,559
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

289
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,911
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

290
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,263
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

291
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,615
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

292
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,919
Actually if I'm being honest

293
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,319
I'm one of the main guy's you know how to do that kind of thing a few days ago Wesley Stern

294
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,647
Actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

295
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,975
Was found dead in my private gym

296
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:25,375
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had some

297
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
Nothing to do with it now

298
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:34,079
I need to clear my name somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do what

299
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
Whatever it takes to find them
