67
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
Size matter

68
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288

00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
I'm him

80
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,664

Cell

113
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,879
There has been a few of these lawyers over the years will try to be funny

114
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,439
You know a lot of personal injury lawyers sometimes

115
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
In order to cast them

116
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511

117
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,559
Will do some sort of

118
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Nominally

119
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Comic scenarios

120
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,935
How can you tell when a lawyer is lying

121
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
When is lips are moving

122
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,775
That is funny and lawyer jokes are gray

123
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,175

124
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199

137
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
Actual execution

138
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
Fairly obscure creative idea

139
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
I'm so delighted

140
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,503
To see somebody say

141
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
I got something to sell

142
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
I think you should buy it call now

143
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
You know honestly it's honest

144
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,487
No sometimes of dubious legality because the ads themselves

145
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
Frequently

146
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
Skirt

147
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
The legality of

148
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Solicitation

149
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Different jurisdictions

150
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Have different rules

151
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:35,519
This is what I was talking about in the beginning rules regarding what you can and can't say in an ad

152
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,847
Who can appear in your ad and what they are allowed to say about you

153
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
All that is regulated

154
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,479
To try to release your degrees by each individual State Bar Association

155
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
And state supreme court

156
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Because

157
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,575
As proven by history

158
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,159
Lawyers will tell themselves exactly as loudly

159
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,767
As they're allowed to

160
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,119
Back in the 19 century you see ads for attorneys on the front page of newspaper

161
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
Alongside ads for doctors in

162
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
Saddle and Harness manufacturer

163
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:10,847
But in 1908 the American Bar Association putting new rules

164
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
Saying all instances of

165
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,687
Self laudation that's what they called it

166
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:21,087
Self laudation Define the traditions and lower the tone of our high calling and our

167
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
Intolerable

168
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,415
Business cards were okay

169
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,487
That band lasted about 70 years

170
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
And then in 1976

171
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,095
The lock Clinic of Bates and Osteen

172
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,191
Ran one little classified in the Arizona Republic saying

173
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:41,567
Do you need a lawyer Legal Services at very reasonable fees divorce adoption bankruptcy with you

174
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,895
And in short the Arizona bar got mad

175
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
Suspended the two lawyers

176
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
Dayton Osteen

177
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
Healed all the way to the USA

178
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Supreme Court

179
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,575
And in the now infamous

180
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
Bates vs. State Bar of Arizona

181
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,719
The Court ruled that lawyers have the same freedom of speech as everybody else

182
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
Gobble gobble

183
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
Lawyers can advertise then all hell

184
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
Hell broke Luce

185
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,007
This is Elizabeth tarbert the ethics counsel for the

186
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
The Florida bar

187
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
She runs the department that regulates

188
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
Lawyer advertising there

189
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,383
There was kind of a wild wild west

190
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
Situation where lawyers were

191
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
Advertising anyway they wanted

192
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
Because I want regular

193
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Where there had been.

194
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
Flatout prohibition

195
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,391
So Florida actually

196
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Had

197
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
A couple of different

198
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,487
Blue Ribbon commission and they adopt

199
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
Did the first set of

200
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
Rules and because

201
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Art leadership

202
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Very concerned about

203
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Statements

204
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
Lawyers for making Anna Roberts

205
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,031
Elizabeth Herbert wasn't with the bar back then so she doesn't know what those ads look like

206
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
But an attorney I talk to you names

207
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Steve Miller

208
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,967
Nose look at when I first started practicing that he's a divorce lawyer with offices in Florida and Mass

209
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,015
Massachusetts I work for a woman

210
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
In Florida

211
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
Doing personal energy work

212
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
And she was one of

213
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
I want sushi was one of the first on TV but

214
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
She did a lot of TV advertising

215
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
And her add when something like this

216
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
Here car crash

217
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
You hear a car crash

218
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,007
See hear the sirens and then they threw a doll

219
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
Baby doll

220
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
Into the picture

221
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
Which

222
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,455
I'll never forget I won't say her name

223
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:29,855
But it it was just the worst thing that I ever see everyday and so I'm sure that had something to do with the bar

224
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
Come in and say and look

225
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,791
You can't you can't do music you can't do dramatizations can't have your clients come on 2K

226
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Can't do that

227
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
It actually goes way beyond that

228
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
Florida has some of the

229
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
Strictest guidelines in the country for these ads

230
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,007
For instance testimonials if a lawyer

231
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
Writes the testimonial him or herself that would be Miss

232
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
Bleeding that's not.

233
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Experience

234
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,967
If it's not the person's actual experience with a lawyer or not

235
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
Qualified to judge

236
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,135
Think of how many lawyer commercials you've seen that used

237
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Testimonial

238
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
Assurance company

239
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Kept asking me to hurry up

240
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Sign a release

241
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
I was thinking

242
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
What's the rush

243
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
Of course

244
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,655
Horse some of them are written by the attorney

245
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
Were there advertising consult

246
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,263
Often time the actual client doesn't even appear in the ass

247
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,591
I'm Jason Smith he is not Jason Smith

248
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,151
He's an actor performing a testimonial

249
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
Which is also prohibited in Florida

250
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:32,063
Nor are you allowed in Florida to have actors playing authority figures like cops and judges

251
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
Saying how great the lawyer is

252
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,255
Nor are you allowed to have actual cops and judges saying how great the lawyer is people inherently respond to it

253
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
Here is whether they're real or not

254
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
So we prohibit their use

255
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,423
Does Robert Vaughn fall under that category

256
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
I wouldn't consider Robert Vaughn and Authority fee

257
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,823
But he would fall within the probation in the same rollabouts

258
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
Using the voice or images

259
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
Again

260
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:01,503
Kind of pervasive in other states tell the insurance companies you mean business

261
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,807
Tell them you hired Jacoby and Meyers

262
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:10,207
They go after your rights piece by piece by piece until justice has been served

263
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,703
Elizabeth Herbert says the rules are meant to protect the public

264
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,055
That people should pick a lawyer based on what she calls objective selection criteria

265
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,359
Other than Fancy Pants promises and sound effects

266
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
If you break the rules the penalties

267
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,735
Are not really that dramatic

268
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
The worst that might happen is

269
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,831
Then you'll get what's known as a public reprimand

270
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,439
Bar sent out a press release so your reputation is kind of marred

271
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:48,095
But it's not like you're going to be disbarred

272
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,631
A few other states

273
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
Iowa

274
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
And

275
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:58,591
Texas weirdly given that it's home to one of the Hammers

276
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
Massachusetts and Connecticut are still

277
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Pretty wild Westie

278
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
And if you are National firm

279
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
Operating in a bunch of jurisdiction

280
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,415
You have to comply with multiple sets of rules

281
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
That's what Lucian Pera has to be

282
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,023
He's a lawyer with Adams and Reese in Memphis

283
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,863
And among other things he advises Nationwide firms on their

284
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,959
And sometimes he'll be looking over the disclaimer rules for example

285
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Going to be like

286
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:31,871
State I said you got to say this but stay busy if I say what state I said state is going to say why can't say exactly that

287
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
So I got to

288
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Weave it together somehow

289
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
It is a morass

290
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
It does what it's I think in my opinion

291
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Intended to do which is

292
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Guitars

293
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
Lawyer advertise

294
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
To some degree

295
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,463
Now lucian's State Tennessee is pretty loose

296
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:51,583
In fact it's been widely reported as late as the state where you'll see lawyer ads featuring space aliens

297
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
Giant robots

298
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,911
And both dogs and cars

299
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,775
That can talk

300
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
Talking cars

301
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,919
And even now more than 35 years later

302
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
Lucien says there's a cohort of lawyers

303
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
Who will see an ad like that

304
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
And say

305
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,927
Look watch Bates vs. State Bar of Arizona have brought there are many lawyers today

306
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Many

307
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Lawyer stay

308
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
You feel that

309
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Much that was

310
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
Was that is wrong with

311
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,351
Profession today if not all that is wrong

312
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Fashion today

313
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
Play dates from

314
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
That lawyer advertising

315
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,727
Turned us

316
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
From a

317
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Professional

318
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Business

319
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
And they just think it's

320
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Unified

321
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
For lawyers to be on television

322
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
Pitching their services

323
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Generally

324
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
Much less talk

325
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
And the dog

326
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Orale

327
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,903
They just think that demeans the profession

328
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,975
And you don't have to look too far down the road in Tennessee to find one of those lawyers

329
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
Namely Matt Hardin

330
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
My personal injury attorney in Nashville with his own practice

331
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
I'm sorry I've got a big bunch on this

332
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
The first half of its about the history of

333
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
History of advertising

334
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,847
Last year he and the Tennessee Association for justice

335
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
A group of plaintiffs lawyer

336
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,455
Filed two petitions to the state supreme court

337
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,527
Asking them to change the advertising rules in Tennessee

338
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
So that they

339
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,855
Essentially look more like the ones in Florida

340
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,695
Is a public comment. Some First Amendment Advocates got involved

341
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
And ultimately

342
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
The courts at now

343
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
But man is determinism

344
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
To keep trying

345
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,143
And I asked him in and so do you think Bates was

346
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:36,031
The sort of the beginning of the end like the the big bang that created the downfall of

347
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,335
The sort of stature of lawyers

348
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,383
I do I mean if you look in the

349
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,943
You know what our history in the 50s and 60s

350
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
Do you have

351
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
Lawyers being seen as a

352
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
Proponents

353
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
The Justice League

354
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,623
You have things as far back is like to Kill a Mockingbird

355
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
But those

356
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,951
What I would call the Halcyon Days of

357
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
A positive public perception

358
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Attorney seem to be long gone

359
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
What most people see

360
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,607
Unfortunately is this unsavory

361
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
Advertising

362
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
The lawyers

363
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Matt Everett

364
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
But might you know my biggest

365
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
Concerned about this is how it affects

366
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
The jury pool and make people

367
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
So you're just a furry

368
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Easy money

369
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:17,247
That is if people start thinking plaintiff's and their attorneys are just out for easy money they might get cynical about the process

370
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,111
And cynical people become cynical jurors and no one gets a fair trial anymore

371
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
That's

372
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
The calculus

373
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,975
And by the way that's not opposed to advertising writ large

374
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,559
I advertise myself none on TV

375
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
You ever doesn't movie theaters and online his that sound like this

376
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,823
Matt Hardin law your experienced personal injury Law Firm

377
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
Selena

378
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
Very different town

379
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,967
And Visually to these they're just images of gavels and ionic columns

380
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
And Matt

381
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,831
Which makes me wonder if maybe there's not something more basic

382
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
What is objection

383
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
What's to the

384
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
Dog and robot commercial

385
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,719
Is it just that you think the ads aren't

386
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Classy

387
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
No

388
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
I don't think it's up to

389
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Anyone else

390
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
Make a judgment over what

391
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
What the class of an ad is

392
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,423
But do you think they're not

393
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
I don't have it

394
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
That's not really

395
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:18,175
I'm trying to really cuz I think all of us have an affair

396
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Turned off

397
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
I don't I don't think they would do it

398
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
If it didn't work

399
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
You think it works

400
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
Absolutely it does

401
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,255
They do work yes they do work for those that they appeal to

402
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
This

403
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,863
Is Lowell The Hammer Stanley

404
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
They are the mail

405
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
Wow

406
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
That is it's just it's

407
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
Just like watching

408
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
YouTube

409
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,151
I don't think I mentioned Lowell The Hammer Stanley practices in Norfolk Virginia

410
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
He's been a lawyer for more than 30 years

411
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
And

412
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,575
Truthfully I was a little nervous about asking him what the hell was up with his ads

413
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,183
But he answered the question before I even got to it

414
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
Sophisticated

415
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
I'm glad that you know that

416
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,119
If I saw my ass

417
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
You personally

418
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,215
I would never call me really

419
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
The apps do not appeal to me

420
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
They are over the top

421
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
And

422
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,359
Somebody

423
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
But

424
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,711
They are not designed to kill

425
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,759
People like me who

426
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,575
Listen to NPR and watching

427
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
TDS

428
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,183
Their there they are designed to appeal to

429
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
People to walk

430
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Watch

431
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
Shows like them

432
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
A Jerry Springer

433
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,095
Things like that or good and fine

434
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Decent people

435
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
But they are used to

436
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Commercials

437
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Anda

438
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
Stable always going to fight for them

439
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,127
And that's what those ads are designed to

440
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
It sounds a little like a classic

441
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,783
Will it be up

442
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,087
If you are an educated

443
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
Person is

00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,159
PhD or Banker or

445
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
You don't need

446
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
To get your lawyer

447
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
From a from a

448
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
You go to that

449
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Sign for

450
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,911
Hard-working

451
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
A blue collar

452
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Bus driver

453
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
A little league coach

454
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
Somebody was

455
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,591
Who's her and doesn't know where to turn doesn't have a lawyer

456
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,943
I want somebody's going to fight. That's what they're designed

457
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
Who killed

458
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
True

459
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
They're almost

460
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,087
Certainly people in Florida whom Those ads would appeal to

461
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:39,487
And so finally I asked Elizabeth Harbor the Florida bar if I called myself the hammer and screamed

462
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
Pinhead flaming blazing behind me

463
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
Would that

464
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583

There

466
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
I think they're a spy

467
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
That are not objective

468
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
Is required under

469
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
That you Hammer that

470
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
That is subject

471
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,359
Right

472
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
I can't prove that I hammer

473
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,967

Bongs and Charter of our devices

484
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,263
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

485
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
If
