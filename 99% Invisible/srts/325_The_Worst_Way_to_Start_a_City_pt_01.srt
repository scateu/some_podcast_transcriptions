This is 99% invisible

24
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352
I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,008
For most of his life Sam Anderson didn't think about Oklahoma City much at all

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,336
Sam is a journalist he lived in New York City for a long time

27
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,896
In Oklahoma City just wasn't on his radar

28
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688
But then in 2012

29
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
He was assigned to do a story

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
About the Oklahoma City Thunder

31
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,856
The city's new basketball team had just gone to the NBA finals

32
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,696
And they had this amazing Trio of young Stars Kevin Durant

33
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
Russell Westbrook

34
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
And James Harden

35
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,048
They were all really different players

36
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,608
We could really different temperaments and styles

37
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
There was something kind of

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,472
Magical and Unstoppable about the way they played together

39
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:57,504
Suzanne got on a plane and as you was flying to Oklahoma City to meet the guys and to write about their team

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,088
He was reading a book about the history of Oklahoma to get more familiar with

41
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,416
And it was talking about the origin of tornadoes

42
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488
And it was saying that tornadoes are caused

43
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,536
By this Collision

44
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
Three separate

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,632
Very different weather forces

46
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,192
You got kind of dry air coming from the desert you got this

47
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,520
Cold Arctic air coming down from Canada and you got this warm

48
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
Heavy Hot golf

49
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592
Air coming from the south

50
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:28,992
And they all Collide over Oklahoma in a way that those forces don't Collide really anywhere else in the world

51
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,600
At that moment Sam had a realization and he wrote it down in the margin of the book

52
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
Harden Durant

53
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
Westbrook

54
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:41,024
Which was the three big basketball stars in the Thunder who were a similar

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
Trio of

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352
Strangely clashing forces

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,168
That basketball I've never really seen before so

58
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,240
In that little leap like I was noticing

59
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,312
This dematic Echoes between

60
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,712
Things about the history of Oklahoma and things about the basketball team and the kind of civics of the modern

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,528
These kinds of connections everywhere

62
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,136
The history of Oklahoma City started to seem so into woven with the Contemporary life of

63
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
The place and he's fascinating and unexpected ways

64
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
He decided he wanted to write

65
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Hoboken

66
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
Not just about the basketball team but

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
About the city itself from its founding which was

68
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,168
Really very weird event

69
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,192
To the present day

70
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,984
The book is called Boomtown

71
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,872
Is one of my favorite things I've read in the past year I think it'll go down in history as one of the great pieces of narrative nonfiction

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,432
So today we're dedicating entire episode

73
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
To my conversation with Sam

74
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:37,088
There's so many interesting chapters in antidotes in this book but I wanted to focus primarily

75
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Aliens

76
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
Scene founding of Oklahoma City

77
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
In the bed

78
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
That's known

79
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,256
As the land run of 1889

80
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
Understand that story

81
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
If you go back to

82
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,376
Just a little bit further to earlier in the 1800's

83
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
When Oklahoma wasn't even a state yet

84
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,216
Is a place known

85
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
As Indian Territory

86
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,104
The US government was kind of using it as the spot on the Great Plains

87
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
Medical

88
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Force

89
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
Indigenous peoples into

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,224
To make room for

91
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,552
American settlers as they took over the country so

92
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,672
Got dozens of tribes that were forced into their all the Trails of Tears lead to Oklahoma

93
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
So that's what it was in the 1800's

94
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
Then during the Civil War

95
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:21,119
Couple of tribes in Indian Territory made alliances with the South

96
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
Rather than the North

97
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
And as punishment after the war

98
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,007
The federal government strip them of their land

99
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,335
This left an enormous patch of unoccupied space

100
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
Right in the middle of the territory

101
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,431
Roughly half the size of Connecticut

102
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,247
It's a fairly big space

103
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
And

104
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:44,927
Suddenly just had nobody in it and everybody referred to this patch of Indian Territory

105
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:51,327
Has the unassigned lands in 18 60s and 70s white settlers from the surrounding areas like Kansas

106
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:57,215
Texas started making illegal raids into the unassigned lands

107
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,007
The leader of this group

108
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
Known as the Boomers

109
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,895
Was a guy named David Payne

110
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,967
Apparently it's incredibly charismatic

111
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,319
I mean the pictures of him he's quite striking Yeezys

112
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,367
Really intense eyes in this kind of

113
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,671
Beautiful hair he looks like he could be

114
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,095
So you ride around Kansas

115
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,655
And get up on a wagon and

116
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,751
Shout out these speeches to the struggling Farmers about how

117
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,543
There was this patch of America that

118
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:37,919
Belongs to the American people that the government wouldn't let him have it and he managed to convince

119
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:44,063
Many many many people to buy into his vision of Oklahoma's is kind of sacred Holy Land

120
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,879
For white settlers in the middle of Indian Territory

121
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
And this is the beginning of

122
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
The scheme that was the land run which

123
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:57,375
You talk about is being the craziest way that a city could possibly have been born so can you describe

124
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
What are the ground rules

125
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,495
Of the land run and then how did it start Oklahoma City

126
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,079
Yasso modern historians looking back

127
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,175
Basically all agree that this was the worst way you could ever start a city

128
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,783
Even within those confines it went very poorly

129
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,135
So there really were not

130
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,231
Many rules I mean so the government finally says yes all right

131
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
You can have the unassigned lands

132
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
Anybody who wants a piece of it

133
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
So we're going to do

134
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
Come lineup

135
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,215
At the border the unassigned lands this is a 300 mile long

136
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
Circumference

137
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,311
In most places it's not marked

138
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
Where does Marcus like a

139
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
A stack of rocks or creek or something

140
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
So come line up around this border

141
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
April 22nd

142
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
1889

143
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
And at noon

144
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
We will give a signal

145
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
And anybody who want some of this land

146
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
Can Rush In

147
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,559
Wooden Stakes

148
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:03,423
Claim some of this territory if you're out in the country you can have a hundred and sixty Acres

149
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
If you're in what's

150
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,543
Designated a town site you can have a smaller

151
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Patch of that town site

152
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
And that's pretty much it

153
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
Even the basics of this

154
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
Is amazing because

155
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,503
Who decides what Nunez in 1889

156
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
You know I'm saying

157
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
Yeah right right there's not like a standardized atomic

158
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
Clock somewhere

159
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,975
I can set off a digital precise signal

160
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,535
So people had to kind of figure out for themselves

161
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
What noon was

162
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,935
And people came from all over the world to set off like a real movement

163
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Around the globe

164
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
You had people in Europe

165
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Like

166
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:45,407
Coming to the Liverpool and coming to Hamburg to like ship out to get to Oklahoma you had people

167
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,063
Putting classified ads in major newspapers in Chicago New York to let's meet up and form an alliance and

168
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,367
Make a plan and go to Oklahoma and claim some land

169
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:59,743
For the day itself you had something like a hundred thousand people

170
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
Show up to line up

171
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
At the border and make a run

172
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
So noon strikes

173
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,727
Maybe at different times for different people on the 300 mile border

174
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
What what happens next

175
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
So noon strikes

176
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
Quote-unquote noon

177
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,175
In some places there are

178
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,735
Soldiers giving the signal so everyone has to wait

179
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
Up north the soldiers are

180
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,391
Have this long rope that they pulled across part of the border that people are held behind

181
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:34,047
Down south there's a river that people are sitting on their horses like in the middle of the river sort of sinking in quicksand waiting for

182
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
The signal

183
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
And then

184
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,167
In some cases they fired guns in some cases they blue

185
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Bugle

186
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
And they're off

187
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:47,359
And you had you know rich people poor people people riding the

188
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
The family wagon

189
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:55,295
Your people on racehorses that they just bought like the day before you add people riding broken down mules there were people in fights

190
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Physical therapy

191
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
But

192
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,951
And they just burst across the border and start racing in this land is rough it's like

193
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
I'm either of their

194
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,071
Dry creek beds all over there Buffalo wallows were buffalo

195
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
Roll around

196
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
And

197
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,959
Immediately these wagon start hitting these ruts

198
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,543
And just busting a nut Vehicles intended for

199
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
We know rough Riding High Speed so these vehicles are busting apart and people are flying out of them at rolling across the Prairie

200
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
Getting up and running forward

201
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:30,367
It's just wild I mean people shooting guns to speed up their horses and accidentally shooting each other

202
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,927
Horses are dying of exhaustion

203
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,255
I think it's just about the wildest seeing you can imagine

204
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
And this is

205
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
Complicated even more

206
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,055
By the people who really cheated who started way before noon

207
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
And they became known

208
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
A progressively at first

209
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,663
As the Sooners

210
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
And the suitors are still part

211
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,783
The modern-day mythology of Oklahoma even today

212
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,623
Yeah right I mean Boomer and sooner are words that you'll hear

213
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
A lot

214
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
Oklahoma

215
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,511
Carroll College football game it's actually a thing that the crowd yells back and forth

216
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
Boomer Sooner

217
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
Boomer Sooner

218
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,959
Right University of Oklahoma football team is actually called the Sooners it's this identity that Oklahomans really embracing it

219
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:22,847
I know you'll hear that like on ringtones in people's phones and stuff so

220
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,943
Yeah there is a real through-line in the identity of Oklahoma

221
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,295
So the Boomers were the ones who agitated for the opening of the unassigned lands

222
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,855
Sooners were people who

223
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
When

224
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,183
The date of the land run was finally set

225
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
Managed to

226
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Cheat

227
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:45,119
A lot of them happen to be Boomers as well because the Boomers felt particularly entitled

228
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
To this land

229
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Because they're the ones who did the work

230
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:53,567
To get the government to allow them in so they kind of resented all these other people who were just showing up the last minute

231
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
All kinds of ways to

232
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
The cheat I mean there were

233
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
There were stories of like

234
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
Hot air balloonist

235
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,759
Hovering over Oklahoma

236
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,879
Just before noon so that you could just touch down on his favorite spot when the bugle was blown

237
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,975
I mean there were many many many camps of people who were hiding out in this kind of

238
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
Goalies in

239
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
And along creeks

240
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
He's kind of sooner

241
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Champs

242
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,727
But the federal troops would come through and disperse in the weeks leading up to the land run in and they reassemble

243
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,871
William couch who had taken over the Boomer movement

244
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:32,991
Was one of the main cheaters and he was deeply connected the railroads and so he and his

245
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
Businessmen cronies

246
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,159
Actually went in many times is incredible picture of him and one of his associates standing

247
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
In what is now downtown Oklahoma City

248
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,047
I was just then this absolute empty scrubby grass

249
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Prairie

250
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
A month before the land run

251
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,167
Mapping out how they wanted the city to look

252
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
And so

253
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
When the signal is given

254
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
Theoretically should have taken people

255
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:03,199
Maybe an hour plus to get there because it was 15 miles from the closest border

256
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
And yet the moment the bugle blue

257
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,087
You had people including William couches cronies

258
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,903
Leaping out of the bushes jumping out of train cars

259
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
Falling out of trees

260
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,815
This mythological origin story where people just suddenly appear out of the landscape

261
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:25,215
And the soldiers don't know what to do cuz there's so many of them in there just planting tents all over in hammering stakes and William couch and his crew

262
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,871
Have a whole team of surveyors who have all their equipment their chains and poles and everything in there laying outside

263
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
As they have mapped it in the months

264
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Proceeding the land run

265
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Part

266
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,183
The labor of making Oklahoma into a real place after this was adjudicated all of that cheating

267
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Who cheated and who didn't

268
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
Who deserve to keep their land

269
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
2 didn't

270
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
Because they

271
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,167
They settled the land as settlers not as city builders exact

272
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
But you didn't

273
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,775
Account for the things that make a city function they really just

274
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
Flooded out their own land for their own private use

275
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,175
Such a little is such a nice little metaphor in a way for

276
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,759
I don't know the American experiment the American temperament

277
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
Exactly you had

278
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,135
Huge wave of people rushing in

279
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
I mean waves from all sides

280
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,255
And what everyone was thinking about was

281
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
I need to get mine

282
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
Got a

283
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,935
Anchor down in this place so that whatever comes of it I'll have my peace

284
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:32,543
So there was no Central planning there was no foresight whatsoever

285
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
And so

286
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,919
By the end of the day on the site that would become Oklahoma City

287
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
You had

288
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,015
Something like ten thousand settlers

289
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
And they had claimed

290
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
Pretty much every single patch

291
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Of land

292
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,951
I mean they were like it was just like

293
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Tent flaps

294
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
Tent flap almost

295
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
You didn't have

296
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
Any of the negative space

297
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,399
But you really need for a city to work he didn't have

298
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
Streets you didn't have a lease

299
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:06,335
Other than the part of the city that had been mapped out by these cheaters and they managed to sell certificates to own

300
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Phone Lots

301
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
On the land they had plot it out

302
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
But otherwise it was just a giant

303
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,759
Absolute mess they could never

304
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,807
Going forward function as

305
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
A place where humans live

306
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,903
Huge influx of people

307
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:26,303
Clean different parts of the land and this is done day one of the founding of Oklahoma City

308
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
What happens

309
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
That first night

310
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,423
See you this incredible chaotic recipe

311
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
They all managed to

312
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
Claim a spot

313
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
Found some spots you know there's

314
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
There's five separate settlers

315
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,919
Claiming that they were there first so you have all these disputes

316
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,199
All kinds of activity

317
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
When the sun sets at night

318
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,599
You get this kind of General relaxation everybody stops

319
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
Jogging

320
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
4 plots

321
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
Everyone stops their work

322
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
People kind of relax

323
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
And look around

324
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Andres

325
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
And

326
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:03,935
Again because this was so recent we have all these eyewitness accounts we have news accounts that were reporters on the ground

327
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
So we know things like

328
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:12,895
Centipede crawling around everywhere because of course the whole ecosystem has just been shocked

329
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,991
Intuit agitation by this injection of humans into it for no reason

330
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
And

331
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,135
So you have this incredible scene of just tents as far as you can see

332
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
Masses of

333
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,487
Brand new people have never been to this place before most of them

334
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,559
Most of whom have no connection to one another at all

335
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
And

336
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,679
The one story that really stand out from that first night

337
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,007
Sometime around 10 p.m. or midnight

338
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
Accounts vary a little bit

339
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
It's quiet it down

340
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,663
And then a voice suddenly calls out

341
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Silence

342
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
It's a man's voice

343
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,247
Is a realist

344
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,783
Really strong loud

345
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
Low voice

346
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
And what he calls out

347
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,231
Very clear in the night air but also totally inscrutable

348
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
Ojo

349
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
Here's your mule

350
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
Everybody kind of looks around

351
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
Every story about what that means

352
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,823
It might have been a reference to an old Confederate song or maybe the people in the camper

353
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,127
Talking about thing that actually happened that night

354
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,687
There was a guy named Joe with a neighboring lot

355
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
Smule had wandered off

356
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
This guy found it

357
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,599
But what happens is more interesting than whatever started because

358
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,927
Within a few seconds another voice Echoes that one

359
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,999
The dojo here's your mule

360
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
And then somebody else that goes it

361
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
Somebody else

362
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
And soon it turns into this life

363
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
Absolute

364
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,751
Bizarre party

365
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,079
Of everybody in Oklahoma City

366
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:51,199
Shouting so here's your mule over and over and over again

367
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,295
It's just resonating over the whole town site

368
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,879
And they say actually it was so loud that the federal troops

369
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
Who were stationed about a mile away for the night

370
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
Heard it and they started calling it back to

371
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:10,911
MN settlers on the outside of town heard in they started calling it out too and so you just have this cacophony of people shouting Ojo

372
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
Joe here's your mule

373
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:18,591
Some people say that it's spread that night from settler to settler all the way a hundred miles north

374
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,687
Back to the Kansas line where this hold message begun

375
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,991
Was the first night

376
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,087
This is kind of the moment that you cite is when

377
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,671
You that although settlers kind of become a town

378
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
I mean psychologically

379
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
It's hard to put yourself out there but

380
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
It's got to be the craziest day of everyone

381
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
Life

382
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,959
You know they've been through it all kinds of hardship

383
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
Hunger and thirst

384
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,799
Everyone is armed

385
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:53,151
The teeth and everyone's arguing and you don't know if you're getting a good spot or a bad spot

386
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:58,015
Your Wagon broke and you almost broke your arm and you know etcetera Etc

387
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,599
And then suddenly at night you get this bizarre

388
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
Sort of communal

389
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,463
It's almost like a sing-along or something you know

390
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,327
And yeah so all these people who are completely unrelated to one another

391
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,703
Arrived at this new and strange place in this kind of

392
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,239
Tidal wave

393
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
Selfishness

394
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
You know

395
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,895
Or something participating in this

396
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,455
Community Awakening and I

397
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,759
I feel like that must have been this

398
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
Incredibly intense

399
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
Bonding experience

400
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
That started

401
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,183
To help this very strange collection of

402
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
People become

403
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
An actual

404
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Collective

405
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,839
Do we go forward and and become a real City

406
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
A video Joe incident

407
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
On the second day of Oklahoma City's existence

408
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,311
Two different leaders emerged

409
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,591
It was William couch

410
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,431
Who was the de facto leader of the Sooners also known as the cheaters

411
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:04,831
He had plotted and schemed in order to enrich himself by selling landscape gets in this one part of the city

412
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,879
And then there was Angelo Scott

413
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
Put come to Oklahoma during the land run

414
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,999
He was a hyper educated lawyer from Kansas

415
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
Who was this

416
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,911
Very high-minded and decent guy who did not approve of the cheater faction and their lands games

417
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
So he said about trying to create some order

418
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
Chaos

419
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
Loss of this new city

420
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,383
After oh Joe here's your mule after the chaos of that first day

421
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
Everybody wakes up

422
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
Everyone has been able to sleep

423
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,015
And they look around

424
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,295
And they realize

425
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
Oh my gosh this place

426
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Is a mess

427
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
There's no room

428
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,511
To fit in an alley between these

429
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
Private properties

430
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,911
Angela Scott is one of the people who steps up and says well

431
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
Let's figure this out

432
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,055
And he gives actually in the second bells to

433
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:02,943
Three kids and puts them on little horses and sends them riding all around Oklahoma City ringing their bells and saying

434
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,735
Come to a big town meeting

435
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
And

436
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
Thousands of people come

437
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,135
Angela Scott steps up onto the wooden crate

438
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,463
He kind of lays it out for everybody says listen

439
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
Here's Where We Are

440
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,303
Our town is chaos

441
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
We have one faction of people

442
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887
QR

443
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
Trying to impose order on it

444
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,215
By cheating

445
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,591
He says one of the ironies of the places that they could have had

446
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
Absolute peace

447
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
If they had adopted this

448
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:38,527
The cheaters plan for the city but it would have been on the basis of absolute fraud

449
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
How to figure out

450
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Some other way to do it

451
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:45,695
Lewis God helps organize an election in which a Citizens committee comes together

452
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,767
The job of that committee is to go around the whole town

453
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,911
Educating every lot figuring out who can stay and who can go and what land needs to be seized and turned the streets

454
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
Alleys in public spaces

455
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
It's like this ad hoc

456
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,775
On-the-fly town planning

457
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,079
And so they went lot by lot by law

458
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,127
And work their way their Way North

459
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,711
Until they reached the

460
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,759
Southern edge of the cheaters

461
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Part of town

462
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,855
And waiting for them there were

463
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
Men

464
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
Holding Winchester rifles

465
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Who said

466
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
That's fine that you've done that

467
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
Down there

468
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,072
But I think you better leave this part of town alone

469
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,424
This could have been the moment but the city teetered into Civil War

470
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Instead

471
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,264
Angela Scott organized another Mass meeting

472
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
And it came up

473
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
The compromise plan

474
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,152
So in the end they had to do something that was really abhorrent

475
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,224
To someone like Angelo Scott into a lot of people

476
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,528
But it was the only way

477
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,344
Two kind of Stitch the city together without

478
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
Actually breaking into violence

479
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,928
So what they did was

480
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,792
These two different plans the the citizens committee plan down south

481
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,352
And the Boomers plan of North

482
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,960
Part of the problem reconciling them was that they been laid out at slightly different angle

483
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,544
This meant that even if they try to stitch these two parts

484
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
So tell him together

485
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,128
It would be very difficult because the streets

486
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Wouldn't match up

487
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
And so

488
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,248
The compromise they settled on was to build

489
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,528
What they called jog

490
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,088
Which are these kind of diagonal Street

491
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
The connect

492
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
The two different

493
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
Secrets

494
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,232
And Angela Scott called them

495
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,024
The scars of a bloodless confit

496
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
And

497
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
So essentially just imagine Walking Dead

498
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
Street

499
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,984
And then you come to an intersection and you have to

500
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,288
Turn kind of 10 ft to the left

501
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
Keep walking straight along that street

502
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,944
Is a nightmare for traffic it cause traffic jams forever

503
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Act

504
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,600
You can still go stand on these drugs in the modern Oklahoma City street grid they have not been

505
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
Ironed out

506
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
Up the street grid

507
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:58,304
It's amazing they could still see it through this day two people know why it is the way it is

508
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
In Oklahoma City

509
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,888
I think most people don't

510
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,216
Probably know it's just kind of there funky little downtown

511
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:16,992
When we come back after the break we're going to talk with Sam Anderson about his favorite research discovery of a

512
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
Is entire career

513
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
I think I could write 800 books

514
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:24,672
Never make another Discovery as amazing and improbable

515
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:30,048
As operation Bongo so I'd be delighted to tell you the story of operation Baga

516
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
Between the beats

517
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,944
Bongs and Charter of our devices

518
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
We're immersed

519
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,272
The cluttered World a man-made sound

520
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
If

521
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:55,904
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa Model X

522
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,792
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room in a kid is another remembrall hearing that voice

523
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Technology

524
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
You talk to us

525
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
It is a creation of Sonic trash

526
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,960
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

527
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,288
Studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

528
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,336
To make them more human

529
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
Turn the living room lights on

530
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
Okay

531
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
Dim the living room lights

532
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
50%

533
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
Okay

534
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:30,976
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

535
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,280
Makes for a much more natural

536
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
Experience

537
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
Turn the living room lights on

538
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,168
Dim the living room lights

539
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
50%

540
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:47,616
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

541
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,432
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

542
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,992
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

543
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,808
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

544
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
Right here

545
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
Npip

546
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,464
We need to talk about something

547
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,768
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

548
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:11,168
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is

549
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:17,568
Frustrated but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know

550
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,384
Know why and it may be time to seek help

551
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,784
Go to oh my God. Info podcast we can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God

552
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,576
. info / podcast

553
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Oh my God

554
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Dot and Bo

555
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
Black Box

556
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,744
So if you remember the thing that took Sam Anderson Oklahoma City to begin with

557
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,536
It wasn't the history of the land run

558
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
It was

559
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
Nike basketball team

560
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
The Oklahoma City Thunder

561
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
For many decades

562
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
Oklahoma City

563
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,008
Had not been considered the kind of city that could support

564
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,056
A major pro sports team

565
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,336
And yet suddenly

566
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
In 2008

567
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
It had this

568
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,992
NBA basketball team and got it was

569
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
By taking it

570
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
From Seattle

571
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,600
Oklahoma City Thunder used to be

572
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,952
This great classic NBA franchise called the Seattle SuperSonics

573
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,352
These lovely green and yellow uniforms and some great Superstar players over the years

574
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,752
And so I had to write this history of the taking of a professional team from one city to another

575
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,544
And in the course of writing that

576
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,872
The question occurred to me why are the Seattle SuperSonics

577
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
Call Dad

578
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,456
I grew up at this time but I never thought to

579
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
To question the name

580
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,320
So I started researching well where did this name come from

581
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,160
This let me down the rabbit hole

582
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:40,512
It turned out that Seattle have gotten its basketball team back in the 1960

583
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:46,656
Exactly the same moment when the United States was trying to launch its new futuristic world-changing program

584
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,960
Commercial supersonic flight

585
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
This is the idea that airplanes wood

586
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,080
Zoom around the world traveling faster than the speed of sound

587
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,384
Boeing which is based in Seattle

588
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,688
What's at the center of a lot of that development

589
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
So you got this program

590
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,576
SuperSonics program and you got this brand new basketball team

591
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,368
And in this great moment of

592
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
Civic

593
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
Sports

594
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
Synergy

595
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,512
They name the basketball team the Seattle SuperSonics

596
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,328
So that was a nice story and I thought cool

597
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
What happened to the American Supersonics

598
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,216
Program like I never

599
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
I've never flown in a suit

600
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
Supersonic jet

601
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,360
Dummy anyone I know has either so

602
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
Why did this not happen

603
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,224
Rabbit hole

604
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,064
And this is what led me to operation Bongo

605
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,440
If you are trying to launch a nationwide program

606
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:47,584
Of SuperSonic commercial flight where everyone's going to be whipping around the continent and the world in a matter of

607
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
You know minutes or hours

608
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:53,728
Then you have a lot of things to worry about there's all kinds of engineering problems

609
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,520
It's very expensive etcetera Etc

610
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
In addition to all of that

611
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,640
You have a very serious potential PR problem

612
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
Which is

613
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,224
When you break the sound barrier

614
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,504
Famously

615
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,064
You create this gigantic

616
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:16,512
Rumbling down from the sky to Sonic Boom air molecules actually get Crush

617
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,072
Crushed and then as Bay

618
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,120
Kind of

619
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
Expand again

620
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,728
Thunderous noises actually exactly the same

621
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,520
Mechanism that makes thunder

622
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,080
BFA

623
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,128
Boeing had to ask themselves

624
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,200
If we are raining down

625
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,504
Cacophonous booms

626
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,576
For the citizens of the United States

627
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,624
Thousands of times a day

628
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,904
Is everyone

629
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
Going to go crazy

630
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
And

631
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,256
They figured well

632
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
In order to test it

633
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
We're going to have to find

634
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,144
An actual American city

635
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,448
To be a guinea pig for this program

636
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,288
In Oklahoma City raises and it said we can meet up

637
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,944
Yeah that's my jaw hit the floor I couldn't believe it Oklahoma City raised it and if I have the Chamber of Commerce who's this kind of

638
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
Shadow government of business

639
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760
Powers in the town

640
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,064
Raised his hand and said yes yes

641
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,184
A lot of money and

642
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:23,840
Probably most importantly this this mile-long super sonic Runway at the airport so they Oklahoma City which is all

643
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,144
Always trying to overachieve as a city

644
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
Would suddenly

645
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
Going to be in Pole Position

646
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Finviz

647
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:34,592
Worldwide New Movement of SuperSonic flight

648
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:39,456
It didn't go through no citizens were asked the government approve of it the city government

649
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
They just said

650
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,784
Pick us in the FAA said

651
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
Yeah let's do it

652
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,672
In 1964 in February

653
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,768
The people of Oklahoma City or awakened

654
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,816
First thing in the morning by

655
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,912
Sonic boom that just comes out of nowhere Thunderclap out of a nice

656
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Clear

657
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,960
Sky

658
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
And

659
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Did you know there

660
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,664
People's houses are shaking and glasses are breaking and stuff like that no one knows where it's coming from

661
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,992
And that was the beginning and this was

662
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,552
This was officially known as operation Bongo

663
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,648
And it was set to go for 6 months

664
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,000
With eight times a day on a regular schedule

665
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,120
Within a week there were

666
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:33,728
Over 600 official complaints to the city from citizens because he's booms

667
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,776
Where real problem I mean their list

668
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,360
They're published list of the damage that it did to people's houses and it's like

669
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
It's like

670
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
How plaster walls were cracking

671
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,992
Ceiling fans were falling out in in

672
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,784
Injuring children at school

673
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,344
Like some I talk to somebody told me his

674
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
Fishbowl

675
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
Exploded

676
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,720
Some stuff is really an intense

677
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,744
Experian

678
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,840
Of course I didn't know why was happening and so

679
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,608
Wow

680
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,264
Finally the city council had to figure out what was going on and said to the Chamber of Commerce this has to stop and the Chamber said no no you don't understand

681
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
This is our chance.

682
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,592
To become a major American city

683
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,152
And in Toledo a worldwide movement

684
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,200
I saw this city

685
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,784
The city government stepped back and they let it go on it went on for 6 months

686
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
There was one day off

687
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
On Easter

688
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,720
And it drove the people nuts they did this systematic polling of the citizens

689
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:31,328
Were they asking all these questions about how they were feeling about the

690
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,144
Apocalyptic roaring coming from the sky

691
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,936
Constantly and

692
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
Turns out people really hate it

693
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,776
This is heartbreaking

694
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,336
Official document published at the end of

695
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
The experiment

696
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,688
Full of grass all these graphs of

697
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:52,832
Of the misery of the people of Oklahoma City just kind of rising and rising and Rising throughout the six-month.

698
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
And it was

699
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
So bad that

700
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
By the end of it

701
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,512
Killed the supersonic program

702
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,608
The prototypes for this thing it was just unworkable it was just it just couldn't happen

703
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,144
On any large-scale

704
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
The people of Oklahoma City

705
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,984
In the

706
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
Seattle

707
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,848
SuperSonics program

708
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,384
And then

709
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,664
40 years later

710
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:22,272
Till the Seattle SuperSonics and turn them into the Oklahoma City Thunder

711
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:28,672
I mean it's just that it sounds like the most made-up thing of all time I could not believe it when I

712
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
That's amazing
