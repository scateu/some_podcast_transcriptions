16
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
Every house is haunted

17
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,864
This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars

18
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,264
We build the cities for us

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,664
The concrete the metal in the glass were formed into countless austere structures designed to give comfort

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
Too squishy

21
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
Hairless

22
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,480
Bipeds

23
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,368
We made the cities we were largely unconcerned with the feathered as finalists for the photosynthetic

24
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,928
Put the quote our greatest scientist

25
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,464
Dr. Ian Malcolm

26
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
Jurassic Park

27
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,840
Life finds a way

28
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
But the life that found a way to thrive within our city limits isn't celebrated for its Ingenuity or lauded for it

29
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,640
Fortitude the plants and animals that have made at the life that found away is revile

30
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:57,248
Familiarity has bred contempt at worst or indifference at best

31
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
We kick pigeons

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,576
We poison snails

33
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,392
WeMo down even the most useful weeds

34
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,464
But in the tangle Johnson's new book unseen City

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,560
He implores us to slow down and notice the beauty

36
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,912
And resilience of the life that thrives within our Urban landscape

37
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,728
You can covers weeds that are tastier than you've imagined

38
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,288
Squirrels are smarter than you suspected

39
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:24,128
Pigeons that exemplified their aristocratic Origins

40
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,504
There no grosser than us humans but let's just say

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,904
But every time you admire the queen iridescent Shimmer of the neck feathers on a pigeon you will all

42
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,232
Also be reminded a thing called pigeon milk

43
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,024
And it will haunt

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
You are nightmares

45
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,960
A few weeks ago I interviewed Nathaniel Johnson in front of an audience at nightlife the adults only night time weekly event

46
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:55,360
Did the California Academy of Sciences I had such a good time there and I enjoyed hunting City so much that we thought we'd

47
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
Shared as a special episode

48
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
I start out by asking if angelwood ascendant rope was

49
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,112
And why he decided to write a whole book about them

50
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672
Synth ropes are the creatures

51
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
Beds

52
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Thrive

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
Together with humans

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
So send

55
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,864
Is together in the Greek and and throws humans synth ropes

56
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
And these are the

57
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:24,800
All the creatures that are living right alongside us the weed spring up to the cracks the

58
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,408
Starlings that are growing generation after generation your attic

59
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064
And I've always been kind of a wannabe naturalist is interested in these types of things but

60
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
For some reason

61
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
These particular

62
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
Creatures

63
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
Always seems like they weren't Worthy

64
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
A real study

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,792
And so I kind of ignored them

66
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
Until I had

67
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
Baby girl

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
And she didn't ignore them she was

69
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
Incredibly interested in these creatures

70
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
And

71
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,288
So I started looking at them too

72
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:01,664
And when I started looking at them in the way that she did through these fresh eyes I started seeing things

73
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
But I've never seen before

74
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,344
And that was really cool because you know you can go out into the woods and find something new that you've never seen before and it's like

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
That's amazing

76
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
But it's

77
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
Even more magical

78
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
When it's been there right in front of you

79
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,047
Day after day right underneath your nose and then you

80
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,095
Are able to look at it in new way

81
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
And see something that's

82
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
Just pops out

83
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
And is it

84
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
Do you remember the first thing that she

85
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Pointed out that you

86
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
Felt like you had

87
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
Define answer for

88
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,383
Yeah there's this thing that would happen

89
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
Pretty much every day

90
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,943
As we were going to

91
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Her daycare

92
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,759
I have her in the front pack

93
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
And

94
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
She would point at basically everything that we pass

95
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
And

96
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
What's that

97
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
I'd say that's a tree

98
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
Stay.

99
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,375
That's still that's actually the same tree even

100
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,703
That and so I had this terrible choice between like

101
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,543
Same tree tree tree over and over again or

102
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,615
Listening to a screen for the entire time

103
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
Until I decide to complicate the game a little bit by making a new rule which was that I could only say

104
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,367
The same thing one time so I can say tree but then I would have to say

105
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Branch

106
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Twig

107
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Leafs

108
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
Stemen and by doing that this one time I

109
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
I saw it

110
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,839
These tiny little flowers

111
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,447
On this tree that I've never seen before and we've just got close to it and they're these beautiful little

112
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
Yellow flowers

113
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,775
And so then I had to go find what

114
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
The three wise

115
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Send

116
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,383
And it was it was just this wonderful moment and then you know

117
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,991
Came back later and saw the same flowers and we saw they were developing into

118
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
Peapod

119
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
And she remembered in

120
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,135
That's cool inside so that was the first real MoMA

121
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
Where is like

122
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,719
There's stuff out here then I could be noticing that I'm not

123
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Right

124
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,839
You can be kind of a toolkit for noticing things that in one of my favorite so like

125
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,447
My show 99percentinvisible we have a saying it's always read the plaque

126
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
It is not because

127
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
All plaxer fantastic

128
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
Many of them are really boring

129
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
And

130
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
Factually incorrect

131
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
But

132
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
But at least

133
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
If you're the type of person that

134
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,039
Read the black your person who notices

135
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
The story in place

136
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,671
And you have this corollary that I love that store the

137
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,023
Equivalent in the the natural wonders of the cityscape always eat the weed

138
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:31,679
So how does that through worked into to how you cultivate awareness in the natural world

139
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,263
So if if you always eat the weed

140
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,615
You you walk through the world in a very different way and I should say that

141
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,967
We're talking about edible weed

142
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,783
There's a surprising number of them that are edible

143
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
And all these things that

144
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
Grow in these

145
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,159
Ready situations a lot of them

146
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
I happened to be

147
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Pretty tasty

148
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,255
If you catch them in the right situation

149
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,815
We just interact with nature generally through our eyes

150
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
I seen a we look at stuff

151
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Sometimes maybe we'd like

152
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,191
Listen to Birdsong or smell

153
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,007
The roses are the skunk or whatever but

154
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,335
We rarely interact with nature by putting it in her mouth

155
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
And when you do that

156
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
All of the senses snap into Focus

157
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
Because you got the feel in the mouth

158
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,271
Centos at the back of your nose

159
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
There's a crunch

160
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
And the taste of course

161
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,927
And you also start seeing things differently because as soon as

162
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
The brain registers that that's

163
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Food

164
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
This mishmash of

165
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Weeds

166
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
That you can really distinguish before it

167
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
Comes right into focusing

168
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,543
I'm terrible at remembering different species names

169
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,335
If it's something that I can eat

170
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:48,479
I'm for some reason there's this like evolutionary thing that like that

171
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,551
I remember the nasturtiums in the

172
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,879
You know that the dandelions when they're just coming in and

173
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Mallow and

174
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
So

175
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
Let's talk about pigeons

176
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,095
I kind of view them as disgusting lice ridden lizards

177
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:09,215
You don't do them that way obviously in by the end of the chapter I didn't feel that way so why do we hate them

178
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,287
University people don't really like them

179
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,335
And what are we getting wrong about pigeons

180
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
I think the

181
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
What happened with pigeons

182
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
This is

183
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,247
I mean they are legitimately

184
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,879
Revolting let's let's just put that on the table noted

185
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
But all the things that we find

186
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,255
Really loathsome about them are really caused

187
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Biots

188
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
But humans because

189
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
We bred them to be

190
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,911
Massively productive

191
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,471
And then we put them in the situation where we

192
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
We fed them all

193
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:48,895
Food and we created this massive amount of food waste that they could eat and they reproduce like crazy

194
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,223
And so then they're overpopulated and they're all squished together and they get

195
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Parasites

196
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
Diseases and

197
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
A lot of the things that we

198
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
Find

199
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Disgusting about

200
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Mr result

201
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,463
Of that Cesaro thinks those are things he didn't start

202
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,511
He said Nobel Origins expansion

203
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
Right so

204
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Pigeons

205
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,375
Are really bird of the aristocracy

206
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
Late

207
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,263
Were first domesticated probably in the Middle East and then they spread around Europe

208
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
With the Romans

209
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
And

210
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
With Roman

211
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,175
Upper class really they were built into the

212
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
Architecture

213
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
Of Roman houses one of the

214
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
Classic elements

215
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
The Tuscan Villa

216
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Is this

217
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Belvedere

218
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
Stop like structure that

219
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
But you can go out and see the beauty

220
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Mapleview

221
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
And that was a pigeon house

222
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
Open

223
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
Rooftop

224
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Structural

225
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
At the top of the

226
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Building an out

227
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Common

228
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Picture of

229
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
A beautiful stately

230
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
Upper class

231
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
House

232
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
And then they came to the US with

233
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
The upper crust as well

234
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
Samuel Champlain

235
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
Governor of

236
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
Quebec

237
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
Person to bring them to the new world and

238
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
They spread across the us because

239
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
Governors and dignitaries

240
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
This would give them to each other and

241
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
You had to have you know a pigeon

242
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
Roost in your house

243
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
Gym nearby

244
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,791
And so they spread with Upper Crust

245
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
But then they became really successful

246
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
End

247
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,727
As America became more and more successful and we started producing more and more food and started building these

248
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Plaza

249
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,799
Statues in the middle of the

250
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Kitchen

251
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Started

252
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
Taking to those places

253
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
You taking them over

254
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,735
And you can't really maintain

255
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,063
If your status as a symbol of aristocracy

256
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
If you're incredible

257
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Common

258
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Think

259
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:40,255
And so they they fell from grace and you can see this happening in the language

260
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,327
One of the interesting things about pigeons

261
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
The words

262
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
Pigeon and Dove

263
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
For a long time they were just

264
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,239
Mixed together there's no scientific

265
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Distinction

266
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Is two things

267
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
Cenote all kind of the same family often

268
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,407
The common name of something we'll both be a pigeon and a dove

269
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
But at some point

270
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
Everything good

271
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:06,879
Wizard of everything bad was occasion and and you can see it today I mean if you try and change it

272
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,927
Around there's this huge cultural

273
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
Antipathy toward

274
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Pigeons rights of you

275
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
If you think of

276
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
Like kitchen

277
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Soap

278
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Work

279
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:20,959
Kitchen chocolate bars

280
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,055
It just it just doesn't work or you could use you to think about it in like

281
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,639
Busa's in in the Bible like

282
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
The Holy Spirit

283
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
Sending from heaven

284
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,551
In the form of a pigeon

285
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
And so they say

286
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,671
Undergone this radical transformation

287
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,279
And I sort of feel for them if you look at them closely there these beautiful birds

288
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
If they're not

289
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,863
Disease didn't

290
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:55,775
We're coming is Cold War maybe even a hot war with pigeons all the time and it doesn't really work all that

291
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,079
What are the ways that we do with pigeon trailers

292
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,895
So there's the pigeon control industry is

293
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
Massive

294
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
Industry and you can do a lot of things you can put

295
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Bikes

296
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Out

297
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
To stop the pigeons you can

298
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
But netting that blocks them

299
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,927
They even have like miniature electric fences

300
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
Keep pigeons away

301
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
And none of it worked

302
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:21,887
I mean it all works to certain degree in that you can push pigeons off of one building

303
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,447
But they can just go to the next building

304
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
And that's what they do

305
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,799
And as long as the food sources they are the

306
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
The pigeons

307
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Will be there

308
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
Okay so let's

309
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Let's go

310
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Pigeon milk

311
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Please

312
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
I read this

313
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:45,439
And it was really upsetting to me so I want you to upset all these people here in this room

314
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
What is Pigeon milk

315
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,559
Normally we think of mammals

316
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Giving milk

317
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,775
But it's a really useful

318
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
Delivery device of

319
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
Have nutrients and

320
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
Birds have figured it out too or at least

321
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
Pigeons have figured it out to

322
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,783
And it's it's completely on convergent evolution it's not like

323
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
This is something that has

324
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
Spread up the evolutionary tree

325
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,695
It's very similar in structure but it's

326
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Completely

327
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
Independently derived

328
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
And essentially what

329
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
What happens is

330
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
The birds secrete

331
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,703
Some nutrients through the inside of their

332
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,007
Throats and there's a little pouch that birds have

333
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Inside the throat

334
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Stop the crop

335
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
And it collects

336
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
In the crop

337
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,151
And it's the sort of yellowish cheesy

338
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,783
And then that the squabs the little birds

339
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
Stick their heads down the parents throats

340
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
And thrusts

341
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
To get the

342
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
Pigeon

343
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,463
Both the males and the females produce that sits

344
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
It's a beautiful

345
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Wonder of nature

346
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,839
When you were researching pigeons

347
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
You noticed

348
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
That a bunch of them

349
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
Have messed up legs

350
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,519
And there's a mystery to why so many pigeons have messed up legs

351
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,335
Yeah so I don't know if you've seen this but

352
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,175
I started seeing this as soon as I started looking closely a pigeons that

353
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
They

354
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,295
Often would be missing a toe or they'd be missing their foot

355
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
Entirely and it was just

356
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:23,487
And it was like this huge percentage every time I would look I would see you again either be like 10 pigeons out there and one or two

357
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
Two of them would have something wrong

358
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
With their feet

359
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
And when I started

360
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,119
Looking for the answers about

361
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,727
I found all of these ideas and people were pretty sure that

362
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
Predators

363
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Attacking their feet

364
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
Why would they just attacked

365
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,479
Or they were getting staph infections

366
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,551
And it took me a really long time to figure this out it was sort of throughout

367
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
The entire course

368
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
The research I was

369
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Cruising down the

370
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
Different threads

371
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,791
And eventually what I found the United Premier pigeon researchers said oh yes all of this is nonsense

372
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
What happens is that they

373
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,375
Pick up little bits of

374
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
Red

375
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
4share

376
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Incredibly common

377
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
Insidious

378
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,031
And it gets Tangled around their feet and they don't have any

379
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Anyway to get

380
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
Get it off and it just

381
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
Tighter and Tighter

382
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
The causes these lesions

383
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
And

384
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,479
Normally birds don't get this because most Birds hop

385
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
And pigeons kind of Shuffle

386
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
And so

387
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,135
Really well adapted to cities in many ways except

388
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
1

389
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
Parable

390
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,207
Protest law

391
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Some reason their beaks to

392
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,559
They're not capable of tear not capable of

393
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,143
What's that okay feel bad for pigeons now

394
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,983
In the book most of the Flora and Fauna

395
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:43,359
Are species that thrive in the concrete landscape purposely make it easy for them to survive

396
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,687
That's not the case for the ginkgo biloba which is the tree that

397
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,735
I probably wouldn't exist anymore

398
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
If it weren't for people

399
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
Planting them in cities

400
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
2

401
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Why are

402
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,439
Kinkos unsuitable for nature and what do they do so well

403
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,023
The Golden Age of ginkgos

404
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Was

405
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
The Cretaceous

406
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
Kinko's

407
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
Rule the world as we all know

408
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:12,031
That's all we think of that you're on it just scared of dinosaurs

409
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
Really they were in charge

410
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
At that time

411
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,223
Kinkos had some evolutionary partner

412
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,063
They had some kind of creature that would help them distribute their seeds

413
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
And today we have no idea what this

414
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Mystery

415
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
The people are still

416
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
Still trying to figure out

417
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
And it's a double mystery because their seeds

418
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Smell

419
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
Like

420
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
Like a microwave death

421
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
Terrible

422
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,239
There's male and female ginkgos in the

423
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
The females produce the seeds in a few

424
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
Around and around September

425
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
November

426
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
You'll notice

427
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
Stop that's one thing you can

428
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
Open your eyes to the

429
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,271
And stop and find the seeds and notice just how terrible they smell

430
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
But there was something that must have liked

431
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
The smell

432
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
And must have eaten it in

433
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
Cherry did two different places

434
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,023
And at some point the seed distributor probably died out

435
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
And

436
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,095
It simply meant that the ginkgos

437
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
Couldn't outrun the glaciers

438
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
At the climate change

439
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Until you see them

440
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
All lacrosse

441
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,031
The world they have these really tough leathery leaves

442
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Great boss

443
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Find them all over the place

444
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
And then they

445
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Retreat

446
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
And they retreat

447
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
And they Retreat until they're just

448
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,527
Apple Valley's in China

449
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Were there left

450
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
And their entire

451
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
Family gets wiped out

452
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,927
They're the only remaining species

453
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
This whole

454
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
Division

455
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
A plant life

456
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
That Remains

457
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
And then people come along

458
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
And people fall in love with

459
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,703
Kinko's and it turns out the ginkgos kind of love us too

460
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
They can

461
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
Drive-In

462
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,615
Polluted air that do well in concrete they do well in partial eye twitch

463
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
Which is perfect for cities

464
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
They're famously

465
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
Good at taking abuse in Albion

466
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:01,343
Backed into by a delivery truck for

467
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
Or

468
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,719
Close to atom bomb there's one just a kilometer away from the

469
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,815
Hiroshima bomb site that survived and regrew

470
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,375
It was kind of amazing story where they just

471
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,983
Barely hung on for millions and millions of years and then they happened to

472
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
Find themselves in this

473
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
Crazy

474
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
Point in the Earth's history

475
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
Where they could thrive

476
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Human cities

477
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,967
Because the the fruits that the seeds are so stinky

478
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,015
We tend to plant only the male

479
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:35,135
The species right that's right people try to just plant the males and sometimes they get it wrong

480
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,207
And it's heart you know it's like 30 years

481
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,511
Before they become sexually mature so then it's like

482
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,399
Oops I guess that was a female but even the males have their downsides because been

483
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
You know they pretty

484
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
Tons and tons of Allah

485
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
So

486
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,519
One way or the other

487
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
So you discovered that Ginkgo seeds

488
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Edible

489
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,223
Once you get rid of that really stinky flesh that's are around them in this quote

490
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
I want to be

491
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,295
Which I really liked a lot says

492
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,135
Ginkgo toxin is similar in structure to vitamin B6

493
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,975
And eating too much of it interferes with our ability to synthesize the vitamin

494
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,583
That can provoke a biochemical Cascade that especially in children

495
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
May lead to seizures and even death

496
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
This sounds alarming

497
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
But it wasn't enough to deter me

498
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,799
What does deter you

499
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
From eating things

500
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,431
And a little too paranoid about poisonous nature

501
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
Yeah I think we're a little too paranoid

502
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,807
About poisonous nature and just poisons in general

503
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,367
For the previous book that I did I

504
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,927
I ended up researching a whole bunch about

505
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
Relationship

506
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
Plants and

507
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
When you look at that relationship

508
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,863
Deku evolutionary Exchange

509
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Between animals

510
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Implants

511
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,215
It's a history of chemical warfare

512
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
You know plants produce

513
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
Crazier and crazier chemicals

514
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,359
Try and protect themselves from animals

515
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:05,759
And you would think that they would just win right because they have these amazing Laboratories where they can just synthesize

516
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Stuff that would make

517
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,087
Ghetto people

518
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,647
At the NSA just salivating

519
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
Crazy stuff

520
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
But they don't because

521
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Animals are

522
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,351
Really really tough and basically animals are like

523
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,655
Pretty good poison their plant

524
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:26,239
Guess I'll eat a little bit less of you

525
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
Interweave evolve

526
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,151
The ability to deal with it and you really if you spend enough time with this history are you really taken the

527
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,223
Lesson that the dose makes the poison

528
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
And with Ginkgo seeds especially

529
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,367
Yes there is this possibility of poisoning but

530
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,927
Also there is this history of

531
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
Millions of people

532
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Eating this

533
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,255
Thousands of years

534
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
So I feel pretty

535
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
Okay well it's safe with it

536
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
How did they end up taste

537
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
So

538
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,167
First of all I tried to

539
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
Do it myself

540
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,239
And I was a little bit paranoid about

541
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,263
The poison it's white like

542
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,847
I cooked and cooked and cooked and I cracked up in the ginkgo nut and

543
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
It was like this shriveled little

544
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,991
Brown thing I was like I wonder if that's how it's supposed to look

545
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
Like it's really hard and kind of

546
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
Carmel tasting

547
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,391
And then I went to someone shoes

548
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
Chinese cooking enthusiast

549
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
Knows how to

550
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Prepare this

551
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Correctly

552
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
And she made it

553
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,888
It was it was a little bit of a letdown because it was so mild

554
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
Justice

555
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
It's kind of a tacky

556
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
Very mild

557
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
Slightly bitter

558
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
But not

559
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
Especially flavorful

560
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
Not it's kind of like

561
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
Overcooked gnocchi

562
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
Just a little bit

563
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,992
And it's really valued more for its texture in Chinese

564
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
Jeans in for

565
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Taste

566
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
And it's it's supposed medic

567
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Eagle properties

568
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,928
Yeah what's the deal with medical properties

569
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:56,352
I don't know I mean I mean the medical properties that we generally talk about

570
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
How to do with

571
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
Compounds

572
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,472
Unthinkable obeid has been shown to

573
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
Help facilitate

574
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
Blood flow

575
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
And so

576
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,104
And I can help with things like

577
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,128
Sodium blood flow

578
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Low in the brain

579
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,200
So maybe yes there might be some

580
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224
Waiting Richard

581
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
Makes you

582
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
Smarter bed

583
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,808
It's kind of a stretch and it does

584
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,392
Facilitate the blood flow by kind of thinning the blood to sew

585
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,952
You can have some dangerous complications

586
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
If you're already on blood thinners

587
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
Such

588
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,840
I wouldn't either one more species before you wrap it up

589
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
But there's a bunch of them in the book and you

590
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,704
I want to talk about crows a little bit

591
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Cruise

592
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,056
Are the species in the book that seems the most knowingly take advantage

593
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,128
Of human cityscape samin shockingly bright

594
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,152
Things that

595
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:47,552
Are probably not good for us as humans like streetlights people think that upsets are circadian rhythms like crows are all about Street line

596
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
YouTube

597
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,904
Tell us a little bit about that and how they've particularly

598
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
Work their way into our lives

599
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,000
There's this mystery because there's this

600
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
This boom in Crows

601
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
And

602
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,120
It doesn't seem like there's really a booming crows

603
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,448
But actually just the concentration of crows in cities

604
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,776
So then the question is why are crows coming into cities

605
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
Season 1

606
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
Explanation for that

607
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
Is

608
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Street lights

609
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
Because if your Crow

610
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,736
The scariest thing in the world

611
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Is

612
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
A great horned owl

613
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
Because they just

614
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,368
Lying around in the dark

615
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
And there's huge

616
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
And there's silence

617
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,232
And they just swoop down

618
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
And totally e

619
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,048
You

620
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,096
And if you have street lights

621
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
You can see them coming

622
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,448
And so. Maybe why Pros are moving in

623
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,496
Well we're protecting them

624
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,824
Were there acting like they're awful lights on all the time

625
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,152
Fundamentally rosarian is always like

626
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,688
Really all about

627
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
Soliloquy you stories about

628
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,832
Through Monday and ugly things all the time and I can be seduced

629
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,416
Like the ugliest building it has a good story I'm like all about

630
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,952
We to the story about

631
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
Inflatable

632
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
Two men you know

633
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
Those are dumb as hell

634
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,608
But you have this guy talking about him and he's

635
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:09,728
Trinidad Migos that dancing up a storm like that it's like the greatest thing ever and I love those things

636
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:15,104
And that's really what this is about you like you find the story of these things and all the sudden this nature which is

637
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,688
Kind of setup to be a nuisance or like in our heads like a nuisance

638
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
Is it then you can fall in love with

639
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,040
Everytime I pass one of those two men

640
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,600
Story

641
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:30,208
And it makes my life a little bit richer because I hear that guy's voice and I think of that hole

642
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,768
Story and the same is true with all these

643
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
This creature is that I've started

644
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
To get to know

645
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,864

Stop at the bus stop in the morning

648
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
Instead of just being kind of

649
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
Annoyed

650
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:48,384
In the back of my head that there's a crow cawing all alike look up and see if it's having a

651
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
