This is 99% invisible

21
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm Delaney Hall

22
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,144
Filling in for Roman Mars

23
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,752
In 1997

24
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776
A curator named

25
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
Catherine Otto

26
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,640
Was learning her way around the Smithsonian National Museum of American history

27
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,688
She was new to the job

28
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
She specialized in medical science

29
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,040
And there was this one storage

30
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
In the building where she work

31
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
It's like that classic

32
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
What you

33
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,952
Think of it as a dark

34
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
Dusty sort of scary mildly mysterious storage room in a museum there were drug charge

35
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
ARS air was parts of

36
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,728
Of mannequin bodies laying around but the weirdest thing was

37
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
There was this

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
Wheelchair that had

39
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:53,152
Go-kart Wheels it was completely customized had a Recaro seat

40
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
That was used in Porsche

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
Cars

42
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,528
Bank of tripping over it and finally I'm like what the heck

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,112
The Catherine. Started asking around

44
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,696
Where did this wheelchair come from why is it in storage

45
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
And no one at the castle

46
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,072
Which is what the staff called in the main Smithsonian building

47
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
Could really tell her

48
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
Nobody

49
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
Completely understood

50
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
Who had owned it had been left

51
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:22,592
At the door of the castle with a note pinned to it like an orphan in a bass

52
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,664
The note said this was

53
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,968
A chair that belong head Roberts

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272
We think it should be at the Smithsonian

55
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Ed Roberts

56
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,344
I didn't recognize the name

57
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
Not yet

58
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,280
If you live in an American city and you don't personally use a wheelchair

59
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
You probably don't pay much attention to the small slope

60
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,632
At most intersections

61
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
Between the sidewalk and the street

62
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
It's just a ram

63
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
A cut in the curb

64
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
Through the country now

65
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,336
Just about any place you find sidewalks

66
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,384
That's reporter Cynthia gorney

67
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:01,248
60 years ago when Ed Roberts the owner that wheelchair was young

68
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,088
The sidewalks at most Urban intersections ended with a sharp drop off

69
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:09,184
That's enough to stop a person in a wheelchair from reaching the next block without help

70
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,792
And the story of how the first widespread Urban curb Cuts came to be

71
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
It starts with a movement

72
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,144
The demanded Society see disabled

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
People in a new way

74
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
Which was Central to that move

75
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,640
At 10 so we're the hundreds of people who helped drag his wheelchair up Constitution Avenue

76
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,688
Middle of Washington DC

77
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
So we could end up at the Smithsonian

78
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,296
Insisted it was a piece of American history

79
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
Ed Roberts grew up in Burlingame

80
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
Near San

81
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,976
Who is the oldest of four boys and he loved the play baseball

82
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
But one day when he was 14 years old

83
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,816
He got really sick

84
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
With a fever

85
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
Within a few days

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
He was in the hospital

87
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,216
Zona Roberts

88
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
It's Mom

89
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
She's 98 now

90
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:02,176
And within two days of that he was in rush to an iron lung because he couldn't breathe anymore

91
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Chinese own

92
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,344
It had Polio in a damaged his respiratory muscles so much that he needed the iron lung to stay alive

93
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:14,464
Iron lungs aren't made anymore but back in the day they were these full-body respirator

94
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,047
That encased polio survivors in metal up to the neck

95
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
And pulled are in and out of their lungs

96
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
Is polio wrecked a lot more than his breathing

97
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
You left him paralyzed below the neck

98
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,543
He could move two fingers on his left hand and that was it

99
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
Is paralysis permanent

100
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,967
Parents survived is high fever did not present this as good news

101
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
He said

102
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
Well how would you feel

103
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,111
If you had to live in an iron lung the rest of your life

104
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,463
I don't imagine you've ever been in one I've been in one and it's not a

105
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
Very good way to live

106
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,935
In order to escape the iron lung once in awhile and taught himself on his own a technique called frog breathe

107
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,543
That's a deep sea divers trick where you go poop oxygen into your lungs the way a frog does

108
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:06,175
Polio survivors whose weekend breathing muscles not strong enough to inhale that needed oxygen

109
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,015
A person could get out of the iron lung for short stretches of time

110
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,295
You swallow air

111
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Like that

112
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
Swallowing

113
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
And then you can breathe

114
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,303
And they kept telling him to stop at that was not good for his body and of course he kept doing it because it kept him alive

115
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,887
An ed was determined to stay alive on his own terms

116
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
Here he is in a 60 Minutes interview from night

117
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Probably

118
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
The people around us

119
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
Think about your own life

120
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,607
What's tenacious

121
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,143
But everything was hard

122
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:04,799
He was asleep but the Frog breathing let him leave it for a while during the day so he stayed in school

123
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
Fast once a week

124
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,407
How's his family

125
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,991
They were helping the world that wasn't built for a person in a wheelchair

126
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,831
Ed's brothers or his dad would help lift him into his chair

127
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:22,207
Drag the chair out of the house and then list the chair over curbs in up and down stairs

128
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
Or if they'll know we are alone

129
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
She would Rangel strangers

130
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
God have to give somebody help me

131
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,655
Get the chair up the stairs

132
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
So it would be

133
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,751
Somebody in the back of somebody on the framing

134
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,311
Get it up or sometimes it would just be me

135
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,407
Graduated from high school then from a local community college

136
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,295
The Berkeley in 1962 the University at first said no he was just

137
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
To disabled

138
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
And where can I safely live

139
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
But she still used every night

140
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
Wouldn't fit in a dorm room

141
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,303
Until finally somebody suggested housing him as a campus

142
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Hospital

143
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,655
Patients room remade into a living space for ED

144
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
And all his equipment

145
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Is Ed Roberts

146
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
5

147
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
To type 1

148
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,127
September 15th

149
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,943
In a series of oral history interviews much later

150
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
Add remembered what it was like to

151
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
To start as a

152
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
Berkeley

153
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,575
Do you remember your

154
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,391
The day you moved in the car

155
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
What it was like

156
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Gary

157
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
An attendant would we led the each class

158
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
And then Edward recruit a classmate

159
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
To help him take note

160
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,727
Aragonite

161
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,799
Appliance usually find a good-looking woman

162
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
Give a woman a piece of carbon paper

163
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:47,199
She would take notes during a lecture and then she give the carbon copy back to Ed at the end

164
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
Are custody people

165
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
Valle Verde

166
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,511
It did so much studying and reading

167
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:06,143
That's a mouse want he used to turn the pages of books started pushing his teeth out of shape

168
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,983
So campus officials saw this experiment was work

169
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
Newspapers wrote stories about that

170
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
Is Mom still like to make fun of the headlines

171
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,199
Helpless cripple goes to college. That's one we all love

172
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,599
Quadriplegic student moved into a makeshift Hospital dorm

173
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
A young man who'd been paralyzed in a diving accident and was initially told he should just get used to Life as a shut-in

174
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
Then a few more arrive

175
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,631
Both to live in the hospital and to find lodgings off campus

176
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
The word started to spread

177
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
Something unusual was going on at Birth

178
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,335
These students had profound and visible disabilities

179
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:51,455
State paid special attendance to half their wheelchairs up staircases and intellect your Halls

180
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,015
You couldn't miss the new presence on campus

181
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
And don't forget

182
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
This was the 1960

183
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:03,743
Edwin to Berkeley

184
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
That's the story and Steve Brown

185
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,143
He has a genetic syndrome that among other things makes his bones break easily

186
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,519
So he's a sometimes wheelchair user and a co-founder of the institute on disability culture

187
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,359
So the 60s were a time of lots of protests and lots of Reform and lots of

188
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Change

189
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,479
Very technical historical term it was in the air

190
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
And it was

191
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
In the air

192
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
Disabled people

193
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,463
Improvised dorm in the campus Hospital

194
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:41,119
Those rooms turned into the headquarters for an exuberant and irreverent group of organizers like Ed and Hales

195
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:46,495
Zuko's son assertive guy with cerebral palsy who communicated with a board in a pointer strapped to his head

196
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
They call themselves

197
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
The rolling quads

198
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:56,479
And like a few other coalitions of disabled young people around the country they started using a new kind of language

199
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
To talk about their knees

200
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
It's in REITs

201
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,599
The radical idea that people with disabilities

202
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Had civil rights

203
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
The right to education jobs

204
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Respect

205
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,999
Inclusion in public life

206
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,583
Distant right into the Revolutionary Spirit of the 19

207
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
Sixties and early seventies

208
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
And the Berkeley disabled students

209
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
Had

210
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
Berkeley reputation

211
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
At that time it was

212
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
An explosive

213
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
The place

214
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Destiny human

215
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,711
Who had Polio as a kid back in the 1940s and has used a wheelchair since then

216
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:32,575
She was a young New York disability rights agitator when she moved to Berkeley for graduates

217
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
Was our responsibility

218
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
To break down The Doors

219
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
And we had a lot of fun

220
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
Because

221
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
It was much easier to organize

222
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
A demonstration in Berkeley

223
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
Then in Manhattan

224
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
You know so we could get

225
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
3250

226
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
Wheelchair Riders to come

227
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
The city hall

228
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
Is a pretty large number

229
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,687
Notice she said wheelchair Riders

230
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,735
With a d like bicycle Riders

231
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,575
It doesn't really have the same feel as wheelchair-bound right

232
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,391
And disabled people from other parts of the country

233
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
We're coming to Berkeley

234
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
Charter School

235
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Flexwork

236
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
To be a part of

237
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,351
A disability Vibrant Community

238
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
I was

239
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
Instantly attracted

240
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
To them and what they were doing

241
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,567
Debbie Kaplan broke her neck in a diving accident just after college

242
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
What you decided to study law Berkeley admitted her

243
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,223
And it don't come work with us

244
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
I mean

245
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,831
Two people in the disability community

246
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
We

247
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
Hung onto each other

248
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,743
Because we all had this

249
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,071
Idea about who we were

250
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,655
Nobody else around us

251
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
You know I mean

252
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
Everybody else was

253
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
Stuck in

254
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,591
The standard way of thinking about disability back then

255
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,663
Charity

256
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,735
Public welfare and

257
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,551
Disability memes

258
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
You can't do anything

259
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,671
You know Jerry Lewis Telethon

260
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,791
Inaudible English opium now

261
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
20 hours

262
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Coast to Coast

263
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
You know that

264
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Okay

265
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,751
Now let's see if we can get the people out there to love you too

266
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,407
The Jerry Lewis Telethon was the late comedians annual Marathon fundraiser for muscular dystrophy

267
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
Mug for the camera and brought in celebrity

268
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
Singers

269
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,063
And spent a lot of time smiling down at

270
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,367
Cute well-dressed children in wheelchair

271
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,207
The rising generation of disability rights activists

272
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Hated it

273
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
Well we just wood

274
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
Fringe

275
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,839
Every Memorial Day weekend

276
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,167
Knowing that all these people were watching

277
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
Jerry Lewis

278
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
Squeezing money out of

279
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
People

280
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Bye

281
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
Dramatically

282
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
Playing up

283
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
The most

284
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,735
Horrid stereotypes about disability

285
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
That

286
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,831
Having a disability is a fate worse than death

287
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
That we should be pitied

288
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
That if we

289
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,999
Do anything we are brave

290
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
Yet

291
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Really not

292
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Real people

293
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,007
I knew that be the only other time I saw a disabled people on TV wear during those telephone

294
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
This is Lawrence Carter long

295
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,663
He's communications director for the disability rights and education defense fund

296
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,527
Lawrence was five he was a literal poster child for the United Fund charity

297
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,111
Because he was born with Cerebral Palsy and he was cute

298
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
That was on the side of buses

299
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
I was in fundraising Appeals

300
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,279
And everybody we open up the checkbook

301
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
It wasn't

302
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
Until I got a little bit older and when I was

303
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
College and I thought wait a minute

304
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,751
What's the subtext of that in the subjects was what you don't want to end up

305
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
Like this poor kid

306
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
Do you think

307
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Give us some money

308
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,431
As an adult Lawrence would go on to study the way disabled people work

309
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
Portrayed in the movies

310
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,295
And on television and generally in the public consciousness

311
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,135
What became very clear is there were certain narratives that got told

312
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Often

313
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
You know that

314
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,511
Disability was something that we were to be afraid of

315
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
Disabled people were robbed

316
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
And

317
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:34,495
I remember 1972 there was a controversy around the Jerry Lewis Telethon where Jerry Lewis said

318
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
The man upstairs goofed

319
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
And I think the man upstairs group

320
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
He made a mistake

321
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,223
And I thank you for people like myself

322
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,039
And all these lovely people at the bloody phone here

323
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
Shoe repair that go

324
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,671
Ring that Bell in my mind from

325
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
Is that what people think of me

326
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
But I'm one of God's

327
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Mistakes

328
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:06,239
The rolling quads and Ed Roberts in particular or one big antidote to the

329
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
Jerry Lewis Telethon

330
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
Ed flirted with women

331
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,383
He got arrested in college for peeing outside a bar

332
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,455
He told dark jokes about quadriplegia

333
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,271
Like when the doctor told him he was going to be a vegetable

334
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
An ed replied

335
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
Fine I'll be an artichoke

336
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
Tough and prickly on the outside

337
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
With a tender heart

338
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,231
Adjusting counselor was pronounced dead the beat

339
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
Very aggressive

340
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
Electric County his response

341
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,679
Well if you were paralyzed from the neck down. You think aggressiveness would be an asset

342
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
The nature

343
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,263
Eco of access

344
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
Of being included Mathew hats

345
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
In some ways force yourself upon the world and say

346
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,199
We're here hey hey hey

347
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
Because the tenancy

348
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
The programming

349
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,855
For the rest of the country even year in Berkeley at first was

350
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
See that

351
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,463
You're going to make those normal people uncomfortable

352
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,983
Roberts was in graduate school at Berkeley the disabled students were noticeably unmistakably

353
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
Part of the community

354
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,663
Even more so because somewhere zipping around in power chairs which had been invented to help wounded veterans and we're starting to be more of a

355
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Available to the General Public

356
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:24,575
It got really interested in power chairs when he first watch another quadriplegic try one out

357
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,647
And now he had one of these new portable ventilator

358
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
Attached to his wheelchair

359
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:34,559
So even though he still use the iron lung at night he could stay away from it for a lot longer

360
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
And

361
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
There was a girl

362
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
To do that as well

363
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Had.

364
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
APK

365
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,455
They have my attended pushing me around

366
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,183
For the power chair a person like Edward still need an attendant for some things

367
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
Emotion now

368
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
Not to go on a date

369
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
I learned how to drive a power wheelchair

370
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
In one day

371
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
But think about this

372
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:29,087
For more than a decade you've been able to get around because somebody's behind you

373
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
Pushing your chair

374
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
And now you're under your own power

375
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
Get to leave that wheelchair attendant behind

376
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,559
But you still have to contend

377
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
If you're trying to get across

378
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Street

379
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
End

380
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
There are no curb cut

381
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,055
6 inch might as well be Mount Everest

382
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,383
6 inches makes all the difference

383
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
In the world

384
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
If you can't

385
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,991
Deck over that curb

386
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:02,623
These guys can only roll independently once they could get over the curb drop offs on the way

387
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,439
Yeah they could go hunt for a driveway

388
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,999
But that's dangerous for somebody in a wheelchair

389
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
Driveway send you right out into traffic

390
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,119
The whole point of a marked intersection

391
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
Is it it shows you

392
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
This is where it safe

393
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Lacrosse

394
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,495
Departure writers actually

395
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,567
All the wheelchair Riders needed what we now call Curb cuts

396
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,431
Those slopes at the corners that make it easy to roll between sidewalk and Street

397
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
End

398
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
Here's where it would be great

399
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,063
To be able to tell you about the inventor of the curb cut

400
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,599
The clever person who

401
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,647
Who first thought of cutting metal ramps

402
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,743
So people could roll into intersections instead of having to step off

403
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
But

404
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
Nobody knows who that was

405
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,959
All we know is that they were not a standard feature yet at most intersection

406
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
9 Berkeley

407
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Not anywhere

408
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,847
Back in the 1940s and 50s

409
00:18:55,103 --> 00:19:00,479
A few communities across the country where people had tried to make parts of the built environment more accessible

410
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:07,135
There was a coach in Illinois working with disabled soldiers who badgered reluctant officials at the University of Illinois

411
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,719
Like she is fighting for us

412
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:15,839
Until finally the school set up a rehab in education program on its most important campus

413
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,911
With Wheelchair Sports and wood ramps into buildings

414
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:25,055
But by the late 1960s and 70s this new wave of young disabled activist like the rolling quads

415
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
They weren't going to wait around

416
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,639
The occasional enlightened college coach

417
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
They demanded

418
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
They were insistent

419
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
They didn't wait for

420
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Her permission

421
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:39,391
You still hear these stories about the rolling quads going out on Commando raids at midnight

422
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,999
Guys in wheelchairs with their attendance using sledgehammers or jackhammers

423
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
The bus stop curbs

424
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,351
Builder on ramps and force the city into action

425
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,191
The story that the word midnight Commandos

426
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
A little bit

427
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
Exaggerating

428
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
Exaggerate

429
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
He said

430
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:06,271
1970s he was a disabled students attending at Berkeley started rolling quads fellow Traveler

431
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:12,415
He says maybe a few of them got impatient maybe they did go pour a few ramps themselves

432
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,743
We got a bag of tools

433
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
Concrete

434
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
And

435
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
Mixed it up

436
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,119
And took it to the corners

437
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,655
Would most

438
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
Is the route

439
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,983
So that occurred on I'd say

440
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,543
Less than half a dozen corners

441
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,871
Did any of these runs occur at midnight

442
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
Yes they were all done in

443
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
Under cloak of dark

444
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
It may have been against the law

445
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
Right

446
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,087
And so you can call them Commando raids

447
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
Do whatever

448
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,207
Those Commando raids never happened on a grand

449
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Scale

450
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,559
Instead most of the progress made by The Rolling quads was

451
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
A Little More lyrics

452
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,911
A little more how real change often

453
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Made

454
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:00,799
One day in 1971 the rolling quads show up at the Berkeley City Council in a

455
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
Posse

456
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,151
Roberts who has a poli-sci grad students

457
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:10,527
Zukas the guy with a pointer in the word board whose learn Russian and is finishing a math degree

458
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
And all their friends

459
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
Disabled and not

460
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,696
When you picture this remember that Berkley's council chambers are not very big

461
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
Really

462
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,816
What kind of stone to see

463
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,376
The whole lot of people in wheelchairs

464
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
We only until the council

465
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Meeting

466
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,496
And saying that they

467
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
Wanted to have

468
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Curb cuts

469
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,872
On every street corner in Berkeley

470
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,480
Because they needed to get around and they want to be able to get around by themselves

471
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
That's funny Hancock

472
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:48,160
Who was a Berkeley city council member and then the city's mayor before joining the California State Legislature

473
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
We were on a stage

474
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,816
Just I remember so we were elevated in the people in wheelchairs were down below us

475
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
Looking up at us

476
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,912
I'm just looking into their faces

477
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,728
Realizing the effort that it

478
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,520
It took for them to be there

479
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,800
I meant they were

480
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:09,920
Requesting something that had never been done to our knowledge anywhere on Earth

481
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,248
Was an overwhelming sensation

482
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,320
But realizing that it's something that we could do

483
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
And

484
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
Should do when what do

485
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
Until they did

486
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
The world's first

487
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
Widespread curb cut

488
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:28,352
City council minutes September 28th 1971

489
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,192
Declaring it to be the policy of the city

490
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,520
The streets and sidewalks be designed and constructed

491
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,312
So will take circulation

492
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,896
I handicapped persons within major commercial areas

493
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:46,784
The curb Cuts be made immediately at 15 specified Corners throughout the city

494
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
The motion

495
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
Cherry unanimous

496
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:59,328
By the mid-1970s the disability rights movement was growing and spreading

497
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:05,216
Groups with the rolling quads sort of attitude or multiplying around the country and even world

498
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,312
And 1 adjectives with pretty much key to the new movement over the next to deck

499
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
Independence

500
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,712
For everybody in this Crusade the physical fixes list was ambitious

501
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:20,576
Things that had to change in the built environment to make a real Independence possible

502
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,856
Not just crypto

503
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,904
Wheelchair lifts on buses

504
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,952
Ramps along side staircase

505
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,536
Elevators with reachable buttons in public building

506
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
And accessible bathrooms

507
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Service count

508
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,704
Slow enough to let a person in a wheelchair be attended to face-to-face

509
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
Respectfully

510
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,776
Not pure down that from way on high

511
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,824
So they got to work

512
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Are tired

513
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
They're uncomfortable

514
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
But their Spirits are soaring

515
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,552
San Francisco's hdw headquarters now is in its third day

516
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,696
And 125 disabled and handicapped are pledging they'll continue the sit-in through tomorrow night if not longer

517
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
1977

518
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:04,352
Disability rights protesters hit Federal Office Buildings in 11 cities at once

519
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:10,240
They're pushing the government to act on long-neglected rules protecting the disabled in all facilities taking Federal money

520
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,824
The San Francisco protest turned into a month-long sit-in

521
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
With steady news coverage

522
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
People in wheelchairs

523
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,456
Taking care of each other and refusing to leave

524
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:28,928
Wheelchairs

525
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,512
The sit-in worked

526
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:37,632
Images of the grown-up disability demonstrator uninterested in pity kept

527
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,400
Accumulate

528
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
1980

529
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,520
Disabled people in Denver staged a protest demanding curb cuts

530
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,104
They already blocked traffic until City Transit officials promised

531
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,408
To put in wheelchair left on all the buses

532
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,760
Now a couple guys in their own wheelchairs lean over for the photographers

533
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,808
Concrete curb

534
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
Holding sledgehammers

535
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:05,536
International University for the deaf try to appoint a president to like every other so far

536
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
Is not deaf

537
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:13,216
Angry students boycott classes and shut down the campus until their candidate becomes the college's first death press

538
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:20,128
And in 1990 when the sweeping Americans with Disabilities Act gets hung up in the house of

539
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:26,016
Disable demonstrators in front of the Capitol building weed their Wheelchairs and crawl up

540
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,040
The marble steps

541
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,088
Make sure that that bill get

542
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,904
Where were you turned on the television

543
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
That was the image that you

544
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,744
You saw that millions of Americans saw

545
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
We're disabled

546
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,048
Growing up

547
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
Stairs

548
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
Capital not asking

549
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
Not begging

550
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Demanding

551
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
To be apart

552
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
Open Society

553
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:52,640
Going where everyone else had gone before

554
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:58,784
Lady wasn't the First Federal legislation designed to remove barriers for disabled people

555
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,832
But its reach was unprecedented

556
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,952
Access and accommodations for the disabled in all places open to the public

557
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,744
Businesses lodgings

558
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,536
Transportation employment

559
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,072
Anytime qualifiers

560
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
To be sure

561
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,144
The Ada required only what was

562
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,936
Quote-unquote reasonable

563
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,960
Employers

564
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
Builders

565
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
And so on

566
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,568
And there was a lot of argument about that word

567
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
Reasonable

568
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,920
What is the bill signing ceremony in 1990

569
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,992
President George HW Bush spoke with emotion

570
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,552
About the recent fall of the Berlin Wall

571
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
Which divided communist

572
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,136
East Germany from the West

573
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,184
Note that will he mention

574
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,256
And now I signed legislation

575
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,584
Which takes a sledgehammer to another wall

576
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,376
One which has

577
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:53,312
Why is the Cavs score

578
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
Too many generations

579
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,944
Separated Americans with Disabilities from the freedom naked blimp

580
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
But not grass

581
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,320
And once again we rejoice as this barrier Falls

582
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,112
Proclaiming together

583
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
We will not accept

584
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
We will not exist

585
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
Excuse

586
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
We will not

587
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
Tolerate

588
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
Discrimination

589
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
In America

590
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:27,872
The guy UC Berkeley officials once thought was too crippled for the University finished his master's degree taught on campus

591
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:34,272
Co-founded the Center for Independent Living disability service organization that became a model for a hundreds of others are

592
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Around the world

593
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,368
He also married father to son divorced

594
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,160
MacArthur genius Grant

595
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:45,024
Whole California State Department of Rehabilitation Services

596
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
He was 56

597
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,144
An international name and Independence for the disabled

598
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,936
When a heart attack kill them

599
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
I was

600
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:59,104
Disability resources in Charlotte North Carolina

601
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,688
It's one of those programs based on the Center for Independent Living Model

602
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
Annie 1995

603
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:10,624
Julia was at the annual March and meeting of the National Council for independent living in Washington DC

604
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,440
And he died a few weeks earlier

605
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,000
Any special memorial for him was now on the sketch

606
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:20,352
We were camping marching down the the main street to the Capitol

607
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
They were going to put

608
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Ed's

609
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,216
Wheelchair be at the front of the March

610
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:30,848
The Marchers follow the empty wheelchair which was being dragged

611
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
Until they reach the Senate Office Building

612
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,760
Speakers got up to honor His Life and Legacy

613
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,088
And Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa

614
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
Gave the eulogy

615
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,976
And he said you know when Martin Luther King jr. past they built

616
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
Statues

617
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,792
In honor of him

618
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,096
Robert Hawkins

619
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:56,192
There's a better way to honor this Warrior for another kind of civil rights

620
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,264
Not going to tear down barriers in his name

621
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,824
And every curb cut

622
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
Is

623
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,152
Memorial to Ed Roberts

624
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,880
And sometime later after the Marchers have gone home or back to their hotels

625
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,208
Ed Roberts attended push the wheelchair the rest of the way

626
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,024
And left it on the front steps of the Smithsonian

627
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,840
Cheers beautiful to me

628
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
That's Katherine.

629
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,448
The curator at the Smithsonian National Museum of American

630
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,776
She's the one who found as wheelchair in the storage

631
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,384
Is chaired now remains on permanent display on the smithsonian's web

632
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,224
It's all banged and dinged in the imprint of him

633
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
There's a

634
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:47,648
Big battery cage in the back it's all customized he has a bumper sticker with a statue

635
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,184
YouTube Liberty on it it with the

636
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
In big letters yes

637
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,512
!

638
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,888
But having Ed's wheelchair at the Smithsonian does not mean everything is now okay

639
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,216
As anybody in the disability Community will tell you

640
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,544
Every broken bus wheelchair lift every

641
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,104
Temporarily out of function Subway elevator

642
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,504
Every Uber driver who won't take a wheelchair every open manhole cover or car blocking the sidewalk

643
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:20,160
Most of the New York City subway system which city leaders years ago decided was just too complicated to make fully excessive

644
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,488
The built environment is still littered with barriers

645
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
Crickets are common now

646
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,072
But they're not at every intersection

647
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,096
Even in Berkeley

648
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,168
And when it comes to attitudes and Prejudice

649
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,728
Assumptions about what people with disabilities

650
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,032
Can you do an achieve and enjoy

651
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
We might

652
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
Accomplish

653
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
Full inclusion

654
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
We

655
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
Have managed

656
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
To make it easier

657
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,064
By and large for people to get into the building

658
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,624
What have we done the work

659
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,208
It's going to make it easier for them to get the education

660
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,024
Forgive them to not only have a job

661
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,328
But have a career those things

662
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
Don't yet exist

663
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
How many people

664
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
Even in

665
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,520
But here's what hits you when you go into Lawrence's office

666
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,848
It's in a building called The Ed Roberts campus

667
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:15,712
And they're actually about a dozen other disability rights organizations in that building 2

668
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,040
The police rolled over an entire block

669
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
Berkeley

670
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,880
And every single thing about it is designed for

671
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
Everybody to use

672
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:30,816
Inside like a great celebratory piece of art is this huge orange spiraling rap

673
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,864
It's two stories high

674
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,264
It's one of the ways to move between the first and second floors and all around the ramp the curved walls are lined with giant

675
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,824
Photos of demonstrations over the years

676
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,384
So if you're listening to this while walking

677
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,456
And you happen to reach an intersection that's got a curb cut

678
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,992
Maybe a bumpy one

679
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,320
Let's blind people feel by Cain where the Sidewalk Ends

680
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,344
BB guns

681
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
You might

682
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Hold up for

683
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904
Just a second

684
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,720
The most important thing I think people can

685
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,000
Realize

686
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Is

687
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
That

688
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,584
By noting

689
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,120
Stopping pausing

690
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:09,472
Paying attention the next time you walk down the street the next time you try to cross

691
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
History

692
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,568
Say a little thank you

693
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
If you will

694
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,344
Crewcuts haven't just been helpful for wheelchair Riders

695
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,672
But also for people pushing strollers and shopping cards

696
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,976
For elderly people who use walkers

697
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
For bicycles

698
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,536
And this phenomenon

699
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,352
Has come to be known as the curb cut effect

700
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
Roman Mars will be backed

701
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,704
To talk with reporters Cynthia gorney about it

702
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
Right after that

703
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
Between the beats

704
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,080
Bongs and chatter of our devices

705
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,664
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

706
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
If

707
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:57,088
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

708
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:01,184
All hearing. Voice

709
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Technology

710
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
She talked to us

711
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,024
It is a creation of Sonic trash

712
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,096
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

713
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,680
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

714
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,472
To make them more human

715
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,568
Turn the living room lights on

716
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
Okay

717
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,920
Dim the living room lights to 50%

718
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,968
Okay

719
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,112
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

720
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,416
Makes for a much more natural

721
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,184
Experience

722
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,976
Turn the living room lights on

723
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,304
Dim the living room lights

724
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,328
50%

725
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:46,752
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

726
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,568
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

727
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,128
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

728
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,944
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

729
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Right here

730
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
E9pay

731
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
We need to talk about something

732
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:08,000
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives

733
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Routine

734
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,816
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

735
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:17,216
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

736
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:23,616
And it may be time to seek help go to oh my God. Info podcast we can learn more

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
Flash podcast

740
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
So I was out of town the last

741
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
Couple weeks on the radio.

742
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
Okay East Coast

743
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,184
Store which is why Delaney filled in for me at the house

744
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,512
But I did get back in time to pull Cynthia gorney

745
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
The reporter on the story

746
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,864
Into the studio to talk a little bit more about curb cut

747
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,912
In this newest idea that

748
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,936
You'll sometimes hear about

749
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,496
Disability leaders and designers

750
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
That's called

751
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
The curb cut effect

752
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,616
So what's the story with the idea what is the curb cut

753
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
Term gets used

754
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
To describe

755
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,736
Pics that is made to help

756
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
Particular disadvantage

757
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,832
In this case for example

758
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
Putting ramps

759
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
Sandy sidewalk curbs

760
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
So that

761
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
People who roll

762
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
Because I have to

763
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
Can

764
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
Across the street

765
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,048
Safely at an intersection

766
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,704
But it's got much wider applications because it turns out that there are a lot of them

767
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,984
These fixes you do

768
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,568
Having helpful ramifications for a huge group

769
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:32,736
The GI Bill for example after World War II designed specifically to help veterans

770
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:39,136
Wide-ranging population in the United States the home building a Suburban communities Etc

771
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:43,488
And so who's the first person to apply the curb cut metaphor to this idea

772
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:47,328
Nobody knows who came up with the term the curb cut effect at least

773
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:51,936
Let me rephrase that I don't know who's out there surely knows

774
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
I was not able to find out

775
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,824
The idea however has been around for quite some time

776
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,616
And the

777
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,432
Most interesting example of

778
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:08,832
Recent times that I learned about came from Steve Brown the disability historian we heard from earlier

779
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,904
She told me that at one point recently

780
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,024
While he was doing a radio program about his work and disability history

781
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
Phone call from his own parents

782
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,144
You said we'll see that was all very interesting you were good on the show but

783
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:27,520
Don't you remember that back in Kalamazoo Michigan by the way

784
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:33,408
We had some purp cuts and Steve said what and it turned out that in the 1940s

785
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
In Kalamazoo

786
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,784
Disabled or injured veteran

787
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,904
Stop watching other disabled vets

788
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,000
Struggling up and down the Curves in Kalamazoo Kalamazoo turns out

789
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:52,608
Apparently at least at that time to have extremely high unusually high curbs because of river flooding

790
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
This guy

791
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:00,032
Talk to City officials into just in a very few Corners downtown

792
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
Cutting ramps into the curbs

793
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:11,040
People started using it and they got so interested in what was happening that they decided to study it somewhat formally and see what effect

794
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
It was having

795
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,112
And so Steve told me

796
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,160
The officials commissioned a report

797
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
So it's

798
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
Said

799
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,512
Set the curb ramps not only help

800
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,048
People in wheelchairs

801
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,584
Thank You For The Music crutches but

802
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Women

803
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
Pushing strollers

804
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,472
Send Delivery Man with the deliveries in bicycle

805
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,264
And then it kind of

806
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:35,616
Ended with something like it was creating freedom of movement for everybody

807
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Examples of

808
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:42,784
That were devised for people who had certain Savanna Jazz but really benefit Oliver

809
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,392
Okay you're going to really noisy bar you're watching the basketball game

810
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
You're following it

811
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,232
With the captions

812
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
You're experiencing the curb cut effect

813
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,888
You're trying to get into a building your hands are full of packages

814
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,960
You use the special electronic button or the button that you can

815
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,240
Just hit with your hip

816
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,032
You just used

817
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,592
A thing that was made for somebody who

818
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,664
Can't push the door or in the earlier example

819
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,552
Somebody who can't hear into examples like this all the time without being aware of it and it's

820
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,112
When I started working on this story

821
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,416
Whenever I would say to people curb cuts

822
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
They would

823
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:27,840
General especially if they were under the age of about 60 and had not been around Berkeley when the stuff I'm talking about what's happening

824
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:33,472
Show me those things that are in the sidewalk so you can put your bag or your stroller

825
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,056
That's correct

826
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,664
What was the strangest most unexpected

827
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
Carpet effect that you

828
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
Found in your research

829
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,272
So the football huddle

830
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,320
Turns out to have been invented

831
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,904
At gallaudet University the National University of the deaf

832
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,696
For students who couldn't hear

833
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,536
Because gallaudet in the late 1800s early 1900s

834
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
Had a football team

835
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:06,496
They had to figure out a way to communicate with each other so they got in a huddle and we're signing to each other

836
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,312
And therefore became the huddle

837
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,152
Yes it's true

838
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,712
So I looked it up

839
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,480
It is true

840
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:20,832
They were signing because they were playing other deaf teams

841
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,880
And they got into a huddle

842
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:29,280
Because I didn't want the other deaf teams to be able to read there signs every team in the NFL uses the football huddle

843
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,096
Let me see which animal wouldn't have thought of that because

844
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,168
Across the field you could talk openly

845
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,472
Appreciate hearing teams

846
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:41,056
And they couldn't hear you in traffic

847
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,872
So this is connected to a bigger idea that

848
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,664
Adding a lot of designers Maybe

849
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,504
A lot of other people know, Universal Design so how is this all connected

850
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,856
The person who is generally cited as the father of Universal Design

851
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,184
Although it's not clear that he actually invented that term he's

852
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,256
To cease now Was An Architect named Ron mace out of North Carolina

853
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,304
He himself was a wheelchair user

854
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,888
And he did a lot of very influential writing

855
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,960
Message being look

856
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,288
We shouldn't be thinking about just people in wheelchairs or just

857
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,056
People who can't

858
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
Seorj

859
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
Here when we design

860
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,408
We should be thinking about

861
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,808
Designs that work for everybody regardless of their Mobility their ability to their ability to

862
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,344
Hear their age

863
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:32,000
And there is among architects who are Advocates of Universal Design there's a set of set

864
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,304
Seven principles which are

865
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,656
To elaborate to enumerate here but they're very straightforward

866
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
They should be easy to use

867
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:44,288
They should be widely accessible they should use the best of the best available materials

868
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
And so

869
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
The

870
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
Curb cut

871
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,200
Has turned out to be a classic

872
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
Example of Universal Design

873
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,552
Because anybody who rolls

874
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
Uses it

875
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,672
Mostly I think that people think of Universal Design in the physical space

876
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,440
Case with like

877
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:06,048
Nice grip handles for people who maybe our arthritic & Crewcuts next

878
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,864
The next Frontier of Universal Design is in the virtual

879
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,912
Because the Internet is

880
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:16,288
The place where all of us are leaving for more and more of Our Lives more time how is Universal Design being applied to

881
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
Virtual

882
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,128
World's pyside from the football huddle

883
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:24,736
Will start being started for the deaf my second favorite phrase in all of this reporting was

884
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,016
Electronic curbed

885
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
Wow

886
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:33,440
Which is the term that people who work in Information Technology are now using to talk about

887
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,744
Ways to make that technology

888
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
Accessible

889
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,328
Available to people who can't see

890
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,608
Chad here

891
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,424
Can't use a mouse in the old days

892
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,960
Can't type on a keyboard

893
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264
And Debbie Kaplan

894
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
The

895
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:53,407
Person who had originally been involved in the Center for Independent Living that we met earlier in the program

896
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:58,015
Does this this is her specialty now she works on accessibility of

897
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,855
Technology Information Technology electronic

898
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,391
Yeah those of us who

899
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
Thought for

900
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,743
Accessibility of the built environment

901
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,047
When we realized that

902
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,607
The electronic environment was

903
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,447
Getting built all around and end

904
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,751
Becoming more and more

905
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,799
Apart of

906
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,079
Of daily life

907
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,431
We realize that we needed to get involved

908
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
Quickly

909
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,735
How did they get in

910
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,039
I think that some of the earliest

911
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,367
Problems that they wanted to address were

912
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
How you make

913
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,487
Computer information available to people who cannot see

914
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,511
You cannot hear

915
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
Who can't use a keyboard

916
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
So

917
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,119
A lot of the work

918
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,911
Mapreduce

919
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
Ends up being a factor in our daily life

920
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:52,031
Siri and Alexa can recognize your voice

921
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,103
Because of technology that was originally designed

922
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,663
For people who need to be able to address

923
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,943
A computer in that way

924
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
There is

925
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,527
Program that

926
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,599
Let the record show I will never use that allows

927
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:09,439
Your email to be read back to you while you're driving your car right

928
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:13,023
Comes from the kind of technology that was developed

929
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,583
By people working on electronic curb cut

930
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,399
What was originally thought of as

931
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,935
Something just

932
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,215
For people in wheelchairs

933
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:25,055
Ended up being just taken for granted by everybody and

934
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,103
Used in ways that

935
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,663
Weren't even originally anticipated

936
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
Faded

937
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,223
For the benefit of

938
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,527
Many many more

939
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,319
The older than originally

940
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
Auto

941
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,135
And that's true for

942
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,463
The things that we do to make the electronic environment

943
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,487
Isabel also

944
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:47,071
So now that Universal Design and the curb cut effect isn't pretty

945
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,095
Widely-held

946
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,935
Uncontroversial opinion of how design speed on WOW

947
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,727
Where are we in the state of

948
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,775
Design about world or the electronic world

949
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
I would so to sum it up

950
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,175
In my own experience of learning about this

951
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Bye

952
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:07,039
Describing a little bit about my time with Debbie Kaplan

953
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:11,647
At the time that we were meeting with each other that we live just outside Washington DC

954
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:12,927
And

955
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,743
Spending an hour with Debbie Kaplan is like a

956
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,767
Crash course

957
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,119
The advances and ongoing challenges

958
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,167
Of disability fixes

959
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:27,007
At least in the United States and we are more advanced than most Societies in this

960
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:27,775
Disregard

961
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:32,895
So Debbie Zinn attorney she's actually an old friend my husband and I have known her for many years

962
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:38,271
She has a very interesting job working on electronic curb Cuts information design

963
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
She lives in

964
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:43,903
A community that has been designed with Universal Design principles

965
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,695
Accessible to everybody

966
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:52,351
Pictures of Handy power wheelchair that gets her everywhere she needs to go we were there in the winter so you go down

967
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,655
And then ice accessible elevator with Debbie

968
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,447
And you go out in the street

969
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
There are curb cuts

970
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
In Silver Spring

971
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
So so

972
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:08,991
On the sidewalk is people who left their bicycles on the sidewalk now here where we are in the Bay Area

973
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:15,391
People leaving these new scooters all over the place every time I see a scooter now I think of people in wheelchairs

974
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
Is right

975
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:22,815
There was snow and I said I turned to Debbie at one point and said well do they make an extra effort to calm and clear the snow

976
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:29,215
No for people who are in wheelchairs who catches Dart around at the way somebody on foot and she looked at me and just burst out laughing

977
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,775
I said are you joking

978
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
So

979
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:37,151
We've come a very long way and I think anybody

980
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,479
Who is presently or about to be

981
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,783
Grappling with disability

982
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:47,135
Will understand how long away we still have to go

983
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,415
It's not just about

984
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,743
Universal Design principles in the making of things

985
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,327
We have to incorporate that into star behavior in our sense

986
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,863
Courtesy towards one another

987
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,399
Precisely precisely

988
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,679
Thank you so much

989
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

1028
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,615
Series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

1029
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,407
The body genius is a dark

1030
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,431
Comic mystery

1031
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,759
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

1032
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,295
We're looking the part

1033
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,831
Might cost you your life

1034
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:30,207
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

1035
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:34,559
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

1036
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:38,911
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

1037
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,447
Maven

1038
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:43,263
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

1039
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,567
Actually if I'm being honest

1040
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,615
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that

1041
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:54,015
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an act

1043
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:58,623
Was found dead in my private gym

1044
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,951
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

1045
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:06,303
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

1046
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
Now

1047
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,375
I need to clear my name

1048
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:15,775
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
