I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,752
The largest body of water in California was formed by mistake

26
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:19,616
In 1905 the California development company accidentally flooded a huge

27
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,456
Salty depression in the Sonoran Desert known as the Salton sink

28
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,248
Creating an enormous

29
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,528
Salty lake golf

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
The Salton Sea

31
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,880
Here we are at the edge of the Salton Sea

32
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
Credibly almost can't see across

33
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,488
And we're just at that

34
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
But it's pretty narrow here

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,400
Reporter Emmett Fitzgerald recently visited the Salton Sea on a hot summer day in the desert

36
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,472
That's just a mild 107 right now

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,312
The water is twice as salty as the Pacific Ocean

38
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,872
The only fish that can live there are tilapia

39
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
But even they struggle sometimes

40
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
It's just the line

41
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
Dead fish tattoo

42
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Tilapia

43
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
Men

44
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:05,696
Broadcast fly everywhere the ground beneath the southern end of the sea is volcanic and boiling water

45
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,512
Bubble to the surface in muddy pools

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
It feels post-apocalyptic and prehistoric

47
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
All at the same time

48
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704
But it's all so weirdly beautiful

49
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
In the sea isn't dead

50
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:24,384
The water is teeming with microbial life in the beaches are covered with sandpipers egrets and Pelicans

51
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
This C

52
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
Best gurgling sometimes stinky

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
Accident of a c

54
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,368
Is actually in danger of drawing up and disappearing

55
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
And you may be thinking

56
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
Good riddance it doesn't sound all that nice

57
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,256
And you wouldn't be alone

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,864
Over the years it's been hard to get people to care about saving the Salton Sea

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Impark

60
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Because it doesn't seem natural enough

61
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,776
In general we tend to think about places and objects is he there natural

62
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Boronda

63
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
Forest

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
Natural

65
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
City

66
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Unnatural

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,224
But that black-and-white distinction is sometimes greater than it seems

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,552
Today peregrine falcons are nesting on skyscrapers

69
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Coral reefs

70
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,112
Are growing on oil Derricks

71
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,928
And some seemingly wild ecosystem

72
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,488
Are carefully managed by humans

73
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,888
The truth is a lot of places on Earth are the messy result of a combination of natural and unnatural

74
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
Natural events

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,240
Know where is messier than the Salton Sea

76
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
And it raises the question

77
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,872
Should we protect an ecosystem that's not purely natural

78
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,992
The Salton sink has not always been full of water

79
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
But it hasn't always been into either

80
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,440
Over centuries the Meandering Colorado River would periodically flow into the sink and fill it with water

81
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,000
And then over time the water would dry up

82
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,584
This cycle repeats itself every four or five hundred years or so

83
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,424
But when white settlers showed up in the desert in the late 1800s

84
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
There was no see there at all

85
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
Just a park space

86
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
At Ross

87
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,104
270 ft below sea level at a speed

88
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
And filled with natural salt.

89
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
Which companies Harvest

90
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,992
Giselle in cities like San Francisco

91
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:11,648
But Frontier developers soon realize that if you brought in water you can grow crops 12 months a year under

92
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
The Desert Sun

93
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
So they said about rebranding

94
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
This place as an agricultural Paradise

95
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
And they started by getting rid of the name

96
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Salton sink

97
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,423
Well that's not a very appealing name if you're trying to sell Lots

98
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,263
So they thought of Imperial Valley it sounded great

99
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
That's not laughing

100
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
Suzhou local historian

101
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,871
Who's lived in the area for the last 60 years

102
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,687
They established a water company

103
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,527
Which would bring water by Canal from the Colorado River

104
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
They said if you start a farm here

105
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,111
Will bring you the water

106
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,927
This water came into Imperial Valley

107
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
And water the April

108
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
And

109
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,071
These real estate developers sold a lot of lots

110
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
In Europe

111
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,679
Two people who wanted to come to America and get a new start

112
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,287
And they had a wonderful agricultural industry going down there

113
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
For a few years anyway

114
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,151
In 1905 the water company cut a new canal

115
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
And before they had time to reinforce it

116
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
They had a very late

117
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,087
Flood of river in the Colorado and the water just

118
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
Came through and washed out that

119
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,183
Cut and flooded the valley

120
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,999
Water broke through the wall of the canal

121
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Poured into the

122
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
The Salton sink

123
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
Destroying Farm

124
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
At home

125
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
It was a disaster

126
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
And it just kept pouring in

127
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
The federal government could not be bothered to help so the task of stopping the flow of water fell mostly to the southern

128
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:40,735
Pacific Railway which had lost train tracks in the flood and would lose more if they did nothing

129
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,039
Amazing tasks they built railroad tracks

130
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,439
Out to the break in the die and then they just took flat car loads of

131
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,839
Cement and old cars are any junk that they can throw in because there was just no solid

132
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:02,239
Bottom there to the river it was all sandy they did this for an entire year

133
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,311
Fill in the breach and get the river back into its Channel

134
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:11,711
But by that point the water had filled out the Salton sink created a massive Lake in the middle of a desert

135
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
The Salton Sea

136
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,599
And most people assumed it would just dry up

137
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Puddle on a hot day

138
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
Which is what it usually did

139
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
Whenever the Colorado float in

140
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
The Salton sink

141
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,047
But the sea had a new water sources

142
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Agriculture

143
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,679
Does irrigation float off the fields in the Imperial Valley

144
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,983
It ran downhill into the sink

145
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
And sustained this

146
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
Salton Sea

147
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,431
And for much of the twentieth century the runoff coming into the sea was about the same as the amount of water being

148
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
Evaporation

149
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Creating a

150
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Strange bounce

151
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
I need to see abs

152
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Pierce table

153
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
And back then the sea was

154
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
Pretty different than it is now

155
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,999
It look like a peaceful Oasis in an otherwise hostile desert

156
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,303
Like somewhere you might want to go

157
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
On vacation

158
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:06,751
In the 1950s a new round of developers saw chance to turn the sea into a playground for loss and

159
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
Angela's weekenders

160
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
They called it

161
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
The California Riviera

162
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
Are is truly a miracle in the desert

163
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199
All new outlet for the cloud

164
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
It's a big city

165
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
A Palm Springs with water

166
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
Here is where you can find the good life in

167
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
Today

168
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,183
Oil tycoon named Ken Phillips

169
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
Build a planned community on the west side of the lake

170
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Called

171
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,607
Salton City he put in a yacht club over there and lay down

172
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
Bought

173
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,215
Sold lots and brought busloads of people down to

174
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
See the sea and purchase Lots

175
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
That's Pat Laughlin

176
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
She used to take her family

177
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
Like the Salton Sea on weekend

178
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,711
It was really a wonderful place to go for recreation when I

179
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
Came in nineteen

180
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
And I have memories of many

181
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,391
Hamburger fries on the beach and swimming

182
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
But the water was great and

183
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
There was water skiing and

184
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
They had a lot of boat races across

185
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Send back

186
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
And then there were the fish

187
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
The California Department of Fish and Game

188
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
Decided to stock the sea with

189
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
With fish in order to encourage

190
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
More tourism

191
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,895
Scientists at UCLA work to design an ecosystem that can handle year-round Sportfishing

192
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,199
And they had to re-establish a hole

193
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,527
Food chain to get the larger game fish

194
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,855
To survive but they started with the little brine shrimp

195
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,415
And they brought them up from the Gulf of

196
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,767
Baja California and the brought in the brine fish and then whatever the

197
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,351
8 Bryan fish came and then the next thing up the chain

198
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
The water was salty but not too salty

199
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,239
And so they try to mix of freshwater and saltwater species

200
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,055
And a lot of his work was done by biologist

201
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
But some of it was just

202
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
Renegade fishing

203
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
I tried them all kinds of fish

204
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Find harbor seals

205
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,991
And they survived I guess for a while back

206
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,039
That's why they didn't see any of many more

207
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
That Steve Harvey

208
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
A retired Ranger with

209
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
California state parks

210
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Spent

211
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,463
10 years down at the Salton Sea living in the desert

212
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,815
Steve says that a few fish like tilapia siargao and Corvina

213
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Thrived

214
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
By the 1960

215
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,959
The Salton Sea was one of the most popular fishing destinations

216
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
In the country

217
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
The marinas were

218
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,823
Full of Boulders the marinas were full of life

219
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,359
The Bars were falling

220
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
Was packed there were

221
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
A run of cars

222
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,271
Hannah coming from the LA area down to the Salton Sea every week

223
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:31,391
Stars like the Beach Boys and Frank Sinatra tooled around the lake and motorboat

224
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
And then gave

225
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:39,071
Concerts in programs on the shore of the Salton Sea

226
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
What's the place to go

227
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,287
There was a time when more people went to the Salton Sea then went to Yosemite

228
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,431
But the good life in the son didn't last all that long

229
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
In the 70s and 80s

230
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,295
Mugs knocked out a lot of the infrastructure along the shore

231
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:04,159
And most of the owners of the marinas on the yacht clubs decided not to rebuild

232
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
Anna by then people began thinking then

233
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
Maybe they were more issues than

234
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
And they were aware of it

235
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
The Salton Sea

236
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
And they were right

237
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
One of the biggest issues

238
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
This was salinity

239
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,471
The water entering the Salton Sea picks up salts from the soil

240
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
And those salts

241
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
I have nowhere to go

242
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
Salton Sea is

243
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,871
The clothes body of water the only way water leaves is it evaporate

244
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
Brazen as water evaporates

245
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
The material the solids

246
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
I saw the salt con

247
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
Centration continues to increase

248
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
Every year the sea gets saltier and saltier

249
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
Which is a natural process

250
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
That's four lakes with no Outlet

251
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,767
The tourist in like super salty water smelly fish die-offs in massive

252
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
Algae bloom

253
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,095
By the 1990s most of the marinas

254
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Hotels

255
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
To close their doors

256
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
And a lot of people had left town

257
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
A rugged contingent stuck it out

258
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
In small Seaside towns

259
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
What the dream of the

260
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
California Riviera

261
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Was over

262
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,663
And then in the mid-90s

263
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
The sea begin to dry up

264
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Remember

265
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,319
Pretty much the only water going into the sea was from agricultural runoff

266
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,647
But over the years Farm to become more efficient

267
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,951
With water they install drip irrigation

268
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
Reduce the runoff draining into the sea

269
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,839
Then in 2003 as part of a complicated water deal

270
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,703
The water district in Imperial Valley sold off the rights to a lot of their water

271
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
Mostly to San Diego

272
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:28,383
Some farmers in the area had to stop watering their fields which meant less water draining into the Salton Sea

273
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
Steve horvitz and many other local

274
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
Fought hard against the water Tran

275
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,063
Which they say was done without a proper environmental review

276
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,159
They Lobby politicians in Sacramento and Washington

277
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
Demanding a plan for saving the Salton Sea

278
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,303
But few lawmakers wanted to prioritize a

279
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Feeding Taurus

280
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,191
In the 90s celebrity Congressman Sonny Bono have been a champion

281
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
But he died

282
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Ennis TX

283
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
1998

284
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,383
Steve Harvey says that he even had trouble getting help from Environmental

285
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
Some environmentalists

286
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
I knew

287
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
They would discount the song Say Yes

288
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
Is the wasted body of water is just a man-made lake

289
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
Cancel why you so worried about

290
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Resumes

291
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,719
How many people talk to us about why restore the Salton Sea it was an accident

292
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,815
Stem the assistant secretary for natural resources

293
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,911
Agency in charge of solvency policy and Broomsticks issue

294
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
People who call it an accidental

295
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,519
This latest version of the song she wasn't asking

296
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Can I put three slots

297
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
Geologic history

298
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:34,175
It shows that the Imperial Valley was flooded periodically by the Colorado River

299
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Either way

300
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
Wildlife doesn't really care whether or not the lake

301
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
Because an accident

302
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
Just look at all the birds

303
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
Ducks game

304
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
Still

305
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,487
And doscher's hair and brown pelican and white pelicans a large population

306
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
There are

307
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,839
About 425 different species have been cataloged

308
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
Are identified it's assault

309
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
Aside from the Texas Gulf

310
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,519
The Salton Sea has more bird species than any other place

311
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
In the US

312
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,359
Many of those birds migrate up and down North America

313
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:07,455
And the birds would stop at marshes in Southern California to refuel

314
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
But those marshes are there any

315
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,087
Most of the wetlands in Southern California are actually probably in all of Cal

316
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
Have disappeared because of development

317
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
End of one kind or another

318
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
The song season of the last stops

319
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,303
So if we lose that link if it dries up

320
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
I'm afraid we'll crash a lot of burping

321
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,679
And there's another reason not to let the sea evaporate

322
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
Probably the most compelling

323
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
When is human health

324
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
As the sea recedes

325
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,823
It exposes dry lake

326
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Call Playa

327
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,407
And it's made up of tiny dust particles

328
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
Most I can get into your lungs

329
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
And cause respiratory diseases

330
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Like asthma

331
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,367
To make matters worse heavy metals and other toxins from all that agricultural runoff

332
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
Have settled at the bottom of a lake

333
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:53,279
So there's a tremendous health risk and not just for people living near the sea

334
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,351
Toxic dust could get blown as far away as

335
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
Phoenix Arizona

336
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,703
The Pacific Institute of water think tank in Oakland

337
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,263
Weather report in 2014 saying that the

338
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
The cost of doing nothing at the Salton Sea

339
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,663
Could be as high as 70 billion dollars over the next 30 Years

340
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,223
As part of that 2003 water transfer

341
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,527
California agreed to send some water.

342
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
The Salton Sea for a few years

343
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
To keep the salinity in check

344
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
Well I figure out a solution

345
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
The Dust

346
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,999
In the birds that water will stop flowing after 2017

347
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,839
But there is a little glimmer of

348
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:35,007
This year California approved 80 million dollars for new Salton Sea task force with Bruce Wilcox heads

349
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,639
And they're using the funds to start designing ways to keep the dust down and the birds coming back

350
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,199
All using a lot less water

351
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,015
The plan is basically to build artificial wet

352
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
With water cycling between pond

353
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
The burying salinity

354
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
Each designed to support different birds be

355
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
NLB walkway

356
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Boat launch

357
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
So people can enjoy the resource to

358
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
But there's no blueprint

359
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,351
For this kind of

360
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Ecosystem

361
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,263
And planning an ecosystem runs counter to a pretty basic ecological principles

362
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
That nature Knows Best

363
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:14,175
A lot of environments the best approach is to keep humans as far away as possible

364
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
But it's too late

365
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
The Salton Sea

366
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,807
Humans have transformed this landscape

367
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,623
The entire Colorado River Basin in such

368
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
Profound ways

369
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
We dammed up the river

370
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
Irrigated the desert

371
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
We have dried up all the Wailing

372
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,071
We have made all these modifications for better or worse

373
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
And now we're in a position where

374
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
We have to step in and

375
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Manage

376
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
That's Bruce Wilcox again

377
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,775
Assistant secretary for Salton Sea policy

378
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
And

379
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,871
I would be lying to you if I didn't say I was a little nervous about

380
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Because

381
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
We don't know anywhere near as

382
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
As we sing

383
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
Just a little bit arrogant

384
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,343
I think we screwed it all up and then suddenly we decide which

385
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,135
Fix it I mean there's danger in that

386
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
But we're in a position where we don't have a choice

387
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,535
Building hundreds of Acres of artificial wetlands

388
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,327
Is going to require a lot of money

389
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,887
Much more than the 80 million they just got

390
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:10,239
And that means California is going to have to start valuing a lance

391
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
That's the furthest thing

392
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,895
It's easy to contrast the Salton Sea with California second largest body of water

393
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
Lake Tahoe

394
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,527
The Beautiful Blue Mountain Lake that Northern California Guppies and

395
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,831
Hippies and yuppies who used to be hippies

396
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Flock to

397
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Every weekend

398
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
I was sexy

399
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
And now there's no doubt but the song say it

400
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
Former park ranger

401
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Prestige Portraits

402
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
The Salton Sea is ugly guy

403
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
Living down there and it does

404
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,863
Hot and sweaty guy

405
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,167
Anytime just repels people

406
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
And at Salton Sea

407
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
Will never be a late

408
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
But he'll have his own Beauty

409
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
Everywhere you go in Calif

410
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
Other bumper sticker

411
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Keep Tahoe Blue

412
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,479
It's almost a badge of environment

413
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,343
The Salton Sea might not be as beautiful or natural is Lake Tahoe

414
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,879
But we need it all the same

415
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,487
But if the Salton Sea is going to get saved it'll need to get appreciated for

416
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
I need to see something bumper sticker

417
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,119
Just got to think of a slogan and it probably can't be

418
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
Save that

419
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,703
Hot sweaty guy in the desert

420
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
So

421
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
Buffet

422
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
See you at the Salton Sea

423
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
Make the Salton Sea great again

424
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
Redesign the Riviera

425
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
The Salton Sea is for the birds

426
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:30,879
We came we saw the Salton Sea don't add salt and keep God in your right shoulder and saw

427
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
Salton on your lap tilapia

428
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
I hardly know you

429
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

442
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,519
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

443
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
If

444
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:25,151
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

446
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
Technology talk to us

447
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,135
It is a creation of Sonic trash

448
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

449
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:43,583
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology to make them more human

450
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
Turn the living room lights on

451
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
Okay

452
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007

Okay

455
00:18:54,591 --> 00:19:00,223
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

456
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,039
Makes for a much more natural experience

457
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,087
Turn the living room lights on

458
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671

Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

Might cost you your life

488
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:51,583
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

489
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,935
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

490
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,263
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

491
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
A dad

492
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,639
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

493
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,991
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

494
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Nothing

495
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:16,416
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

Was found dead in my private gym

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

Even worse

499
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,424
The cops think that I had something to do with it

500
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
Now

501
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,752
I need to clear my name

502
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:37,152
