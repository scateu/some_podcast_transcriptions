I'm Roman Mars

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,472
So tell me why this isn't a repeat

00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
Goatman

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,312
In the first story we talk to Doctor Keith

21
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
Okay

22
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:22,688
In the first story we talk to doctor Q at MIT and he told me how America you

23
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,968
Used to be all about the

24
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,504
Serpentine line the first

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,784
Come first serve

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,416
This is where one line serves all the available register is like the way the airline ticket counter used to be

27
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,000
Or Wendy's

Changing the American Experience of waiting in line

29
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,608
He said that I was onto something

30
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,448
Priority line is where you pay to get to the front of the line

31
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,216
Exclusive

32
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
Shorter

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,008
Faster-moving one

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,056
All right I think that's good

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
That is Benjamin Walker

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,224
I hear all about cute earring design check out episode number 49 of 99% invisible

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,528
Benjamin Walker is Q obsessed

38
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,112
He also did a half hour radio documentary on priority queues

39
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
For the BBC

40
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
I took a trip a

41
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
Across the country

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
Tree and I visited

43
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Highways

44
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
Amusement park

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
Community colleges

46
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,376
Who was using these priority queues and how they work

47
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,680
But the other thing I found out is that

48
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
Can actually help us understand

49
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
All the fighting that's going on

50
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
Over the internet

51
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,104
You mean like on a message board

52
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,944
Talking about the internet internet

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
The wires and the pipes

54
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Where do we start

55
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,552
We start with Netflix

56
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,488
Chief product officer at Netflix and I've been here for about 10 minutes

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
And

58
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:47,168
Built a lot of the technology that we refuse to fill both the DVD service and now the streaming service

59
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
News accent has faded a bit

60
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
You can hear he's a Brit

61
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,080
Back 13 years ago I was incorrectly more

62
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
British

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
Speaking that I am today and

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
Tilda comes naturally to a bread this

65
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
Does it worth to you

66
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,392
In addition it's it's a computer science technology watusi

67
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
Motivations for that happening

68
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
When I

69
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:17,632
Drafted the original specification for the thing that you was going to The Logical what to use and it kind of slipped into

70
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
Product usage

71
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,032
Americans generally don't use the word cue and referring to an ordered list or line until

72
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
Netflix

73
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,360
Is very clear to me at least

74
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
Within in a month to

75
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,224
Refusing a lot that it would probably was the wrong way

76
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,784
For the US market

77
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,344
People see this word q u e u e

78
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
And they have no idea how to pronounce it

79
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,488
Way too many weird pronunciations of that word

80
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
From quetta que yo to

81
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,632
All kinds of weird and wonderful things that it's him

82
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
Quite bizarre

83
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:56,032
And so I have been lobbying for about a decade to change the word Q2

84
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
A list

85
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,336
Something different

86
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
Unfortunately

87
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,456
The marketing department was very attached to the ownable

88
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,576
Qy because it's such an unusual had it since it's honorable from a brand perspective

89
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
And so are

90
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
With that we've been that you think you ever sent to a Netflix US somewhat inextricably linked together I think

91
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,815
In the consumers mind here in the US

92
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
Oatmeal it seems that you might

93
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Single-handedly

94
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
Responsible

95
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
For how many Americans

96
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,031
Know this word today

97
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,591
I would say that you could make a case

98
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
Because of Netflix

99
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
That this word even has a

100
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Understanding

101
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
Recognition

102
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
That's out there today

103
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
It seems like a really comes out of you

104
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:47,231
Well I guess that's possible indeed I have to say this probably thinks that I'm more proud of introducing

105
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,047
Does the US consume early American public

106
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,631
That's possible that that's one of them

107
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,679
No Coast

108
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
Most of our business is streaming

109
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
The

110
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,543
The Q is a much less

111
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
Relevant and much less important piece of

112
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
How we do business

113
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
Netflix's future is not in DVDs

114
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,783
But the queue is still Central to Netflix's existence

115
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Because

116
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Of Comcast

117
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,487
85% of Americans who want a high-speed wired connection to their home in the next

118
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
5 years or so

119
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,815
Their only choice will be there local

120
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,911
And in 22 of America's 25 largest

121
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
That local incumbent

122
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Comcast

123
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
So they're the information

124
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Not just

125
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Internet access

126
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
Ryder Rochester

127
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
Entertainment provider not just

128
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
Sports

129
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
There every

130
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
Susan Crawford is a law in public

131
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Public policy professor

132
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
And writer

133
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
And her upcoming book

134
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
Captive audience

135
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,647
She warns that Comcast is using its

136
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
Power and Market domination

137
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
What companies like Netflix

138
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,839
Let's say I'm sick one day and I watch

139
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
A whole bunch of episodes

140
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Mad Men

141
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Over my neck

142
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
And then I wake up in Exmore

143
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
And my Broadband bill is

144
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
Higher

145
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
Because I watched

146
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
That's what Comcast

147
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Is trying to put in

148
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Place

149
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
This idea that

150
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
Any video from anybody other than them

151
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,879
Will is going to do nothing but make your Broadband Bill higher

152
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
It's actually

153
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Brutal

154
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,743
Because what it does is train consumers

155
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,791
Not to want to watch now

156
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
Netflix

157
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
And this practice of treating Comcast

158
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,311
Streaming video differently than

159
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
HBOGo Hulu and Netflix

160
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,943
Has been criticized publicly by the CEO of net

161
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
Netflix Reed Hastings in particular

162
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,295
And net neutrality advocates in general

163
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:54,207
The idea of net neutrality

164
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,023
At least all the data of a given type

165
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
Sol video should arrive

166
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
Your computer or

167
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
Or TV

168
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,447
Without any prioritization or discrimination based on

169
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
Where that video is coming from

170
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,847
Susan Crawford may be able to watch Mad Men all day long but

171
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:15,711
Her concern about the cable companies in net neutrality goes Way Beyond

172
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,391
Focusing on Netflix in some ways is a little misleading because it's just an application like another

173
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,975
Imagine instead

174
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,535
Backup of all your files on your computer

175
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,423
Really good connection to do that

176
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,007
What is the standing in the middle

177
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,359
Who could charge whatever he wanted to for your ability to run your business

178
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
Any high bandwidth Apple

179
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Is actually

180
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,991
Subject to this kind of highway robbery

181
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
Comcast cable

182
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,439
What Susan Crawford wants us to understand is that if companies like Comcast succeed and cable eyes and be in

183
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:03,071
Internet Denzel routinely use their power to single out a type of service or a type of data

184
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,399
And prioritize some and discriminate against others

185
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,751
Was not how the internet was originally designed the funk

186
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
Totally

187
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Different

188
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Model

189
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,151
We have these two models that are clashing

190
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
Like planet

191
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
And1 model

192
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Definitely

193
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,831
The other planet is the basic idea telecommunications in

194
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,647
Where everybody gets the same service

195
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:32,767
At a reasonable price and that allows all kinds of interesting things to happen

196
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
It was called

197
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
Common carriage

198
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Which war

199
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,375
Universal service

200
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
Basic ideas that everybody is a

201
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
Society gets access

202
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,823
Common carrier is this is really what's at the heart of a net neutrality

203
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615
The debate is the idea that

204
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Access to telecommunication

205
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
Be transparent

206
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
Affordable Fair

207
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
And predictable

208
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
Sort of like a good old-fashioned

209
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
Q

210
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,647
Q-Zar the essence of democracy

211
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:05,279
In that they're predictable you can see when you're going to get to the front of the line no one gets special treatment

212
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
But you're all standing in line and take your policing

213
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,399
Each other someone cuts in line people get prettier at 8

214
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,287
The opposite of that innocence is a system that's only driven by money

215
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
Where people buy preference

216
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,407
To get to their place in line or decide what

217
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
Services they get ax

218
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
What happened in communication

219
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,807
Is that what we used to think of as a

220
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,879
Basic affordances everybody got at a reasonable price

221
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,439
Has become more and more

222
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
Within the sphere of

223
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Markets

224
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
The problem with attaching

225
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
A market

226
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
2

227
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Communications

228
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Is that is ideal

229
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
Predictability

230
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,239
Knowing what you're going to get it being treated just

231
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
The same as everybody else

232
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Goes out the window

233
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,663
Net neutrality Advocates like Susan Crawford argue that cable companies like Comcast

234
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,967
Need to be policed and regulated

235
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,783
Because they don't consider their networks parts

236
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
Of America's information infrastructure

237
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,647
This is why we never had a telephone nutria

238
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Because the telephone

239
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,743
Was considered a vital component of

240
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
America's Telecommunications

241
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,607
It used to be that all Americans had itself

242
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,703
And they could call anybody they wanted to that was our basic Communications

243
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,543
We subsidize the very poorest Americans

244
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
Be sure to have a telephone line

245
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,431
And the telephone company had no say over what business

246
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
To transact

247
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Using that

248
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
As time went by

249
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
Cable actor

250
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
Garden

251
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Providing

252
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Telephone

253
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Tazewell

254
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
Now internet

255
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
They

256
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
Don't see themselves

257
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,583
What's as providing Democratic public service

258
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
And they

259
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
Really held onto the right to

260
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
Just charge whatever they want

261
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
For access

262
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
That wire and raise prices

263
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
If you like it

264
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
The cable companies argue

265
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,455
The net neutrality regulations will be burdensome and unnecessary

266
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
Market competition they say Protect

267
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
The American Consumer

268
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:09,183
But Susan Crawford who was part of Obama's 2009 FCC transition team

269
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Says competition

270
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,279
Disappeared a long time ago

271
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
We used to think that competition

272
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
Between the telephone

273
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
Cableguys

274
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
Would protect

275
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
And on that basis back

276
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
2002

277
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
Wheatie regulator the entire sector

278
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,639
No more Federal oversight go ahead charge whatever you want

279
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,943
Because competition will be the cop on the beat

280
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,783
If you remember back over a decade ago there used to be

281
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
Internet service

282
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
And it never really occurred to me why

283
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,671
All those options went away and

284
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,999
Cable company became the only option for a lot of people when it come

285
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
High speed internet

286
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,071
It all boils down to something

287
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Fundamental

288
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
The internet

289
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
The wires

290
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,703
The telephone companies

291
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,239
Old copper wiring

292
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
That couldn't handle internet

293
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
Network traffic

294
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,359
And they just kind of gave up

295
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,431
Telephone companies realized it was just too expensive

296
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
The dig up

297
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
Can old copper wires and replace them

298
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
By contrast

299
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
All the cable companies have to do to upgrade the service they are

300
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,903
Copper is to update the electronics

301
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,695
Don't have to dig up the wire just

302
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
What new gear on the back of your wires

303
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
Which is really cheap

304
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,631
Comparison of cost advantage on the cable side has been so great

305
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,191
The telephone companies have simply dropped out

306
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,751
And the cable companies won by default

307
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Leaving us with

308
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,591
Actually no cop in the beat we've got the worst of Both Worlds

309
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,407
Neither competition nor oversight

310
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,247
In the end it's more like the worst of three world

311
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Because

312
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:42,111
When we turn over the future of the internet to a cable company

313
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
Susan Crawford says

314
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
We don't

315
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
Even get a few

316
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
What is all amounts to

317
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
Is nothing more than just

318
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
Entertainment

319
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,399
Rather than something that produces new forms of

320
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
Making living new jobs

321
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
New ways of

322
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
Venting

323
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Valuable things

324
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
The world we won't have that sandbar

325
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Other country

326
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
But we won't

327
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,503
In America may have to get used to being at the back of the line

328
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,863
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Benjamin Walker from the radio program too much in

329
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
Information from WFMU

With a Little Help From Me Roman Mars and Sam Greenspan

331
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:36,639
We are project of kalw 91.7 local public radio in San Francisco in the American is due to

332
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,735
What's in San Francisco

333
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:53,279
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world

334
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
Man-made sound

335
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
If

336
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,727
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

337
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,823
Call hearing. Voice

338
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
Technology talk to us

339
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
It is a creation of Sonic trash

340
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,735
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

341
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:18,367
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology to make them more human

342
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Turn the living room lights on

343
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Okay

344
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,559
Dim the living room lights to 50%

345
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Okay

346
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:35,007
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

347
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,823
Makes for a much more natural experience

348
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,871
Turn the living room lights on

349
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
Dim the living room lights to 50%

350
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:51,391

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

365
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,335
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

366
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,919
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

367
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
We're looking the part

368
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:25,599
Might cost you your life you know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked to play superhero and

369
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:30,463
In the movie or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

370
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,815
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

371
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
I'm having
