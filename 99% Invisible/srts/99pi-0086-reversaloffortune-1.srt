This is 99% invisible

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,448
I fell in love with architecture

24
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728
On the Chicago River

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,288
You can endlessly argue about which

26
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,080
City has the greatest architecture

27
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,408
One thing that puts Chicago near the top for me

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,248
Is that the Chicago River provides a beautiful vantage point

29
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,552
To take in all the Marvel is skyscraper

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
Rather than being crammed in on the sidewalk between looming Towers trying and probably failing to take it all in

31
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,000
The river

32
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,792
Pushes the buildings apart

33
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,888
And gives you the opportunity to post by on the roof of a fairy

34
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
Glass

35
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,704
Steel and concrete wonders

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,752
Presented in their full Glory

37
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
Everywhere you turn

38
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,896
The probably the city's biggest design a team and isn't a building at all

39
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
It's that River itself

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,272
Waterway disguised as a remnant of a natural landscape

41
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
But it really isn't

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,880
It's hard to tell when you see the river but it's going the wrong way

43
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,672
It should flow into Lake Michigan

44
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Pennsaid

45
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,256
Fresh water from Lake Michigan flows backward

46
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,536
Into the city

47
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:15,168
The Chicago River is the large part A carefully-designed extension of the city sewer system

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,728
Even calling it a river may be off base

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,592
It's not really a river in Chicago it's really the Chicago canal

50
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,920
There's not an inch I don't think of the Chicago River that is natural inches

51
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Death Richard cahan

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,528
He's a journalist and historian in Chicago

53
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,880
And in 2012 he co-wrote and published a book called The Lost panorama

54
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
When Chicago changed its River in the land Beyond

55
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,536
It's still with these gorgeous pictures from before and mostly after

56
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,840
One of the biggest Urban Design project

57
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Ever

58
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
The reversal

59
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
And a complete transformation

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
Are the Chicago River

61
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
And that is Dan Weisman

62
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
The journalist

63
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
Moreau triangular buildings

64
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
A lifelong

65
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
Die Hard

66
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Chicago

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,712
Reversing the river was actually the third in the series of Epic design project

68
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,248
Almost 50 years

69
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,344
Three projects that I melted to 19th century Engineers just

70
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,744
Taking it to the laws of nature with a kind of moxie but just seems to be folded into the DNA of 19th century

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
Engineers

72
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
And which is the first two

73
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,632
We're talking about two decades of massive ridiculous

74
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,984
Change people's ideas of how far you could go to make a city work

75
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,800
And those two have been so obscured by time

76
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
It was basically one guy who proposed and executed not one but two of these

77
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Project

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
Unknown today

79
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
Ellis chesbrough

80
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,112
If you've never heard of Ellis chesbrough

81
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,696
You're not allowed to talk to his I record this he doesn't even have a Wikipedia entry

82
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
But you can bet

83
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
Richard Kane knows who he is

84
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,656
So he was a star and there is to his house is just North of downtown and there's a little plaque in for the house I was parked my car in front of it

85
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:56,800
And it says House of Alice chesbro and I'm sure I'm the only person that ever was very excited about seeing it

86
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,104
Stop back in the 1800s

87
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Chesbro with the man

88
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
And no one has ever worked harder

89
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
To save Chicago from its own poop

90
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,136
Poop butt thing that has brought cities to their knees

91
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
For millennia

92
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
Now here's the setup

93
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,720
It 1854

94
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,047
City of Chicago has been growing like crazy for a couple of decades

95
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:23,167
Cute bun with a W population every few years

96
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Call Rapids

97
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Wiped out

98
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,543
6% of the city 6%

99
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
That summer

100
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,871
One account headcollar killing six

101
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,943
60 people a day in a town of 70000

102
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
One of the Republic this way

103
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,807
The death cart was constantly in the street

104
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
And not to be gross

105
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
The caller

106
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,927
It is a super nasty way to go

107
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Sudden

108
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
Painful in love

109
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
Ropes

110
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,583
Vomiting diarrhea horrible cramps in your dead in less than a day

111
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
It is a really

112
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,399
Really unpleasant

113
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
The people were freaking out

114
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
Interchez bro

115
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
Amanda name with work he done in Boston

116
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,359
Will you people meet Old Chicago is a sewer

117
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
Which was actually a newish idea.

118
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
The time in the US

119
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
Northern City here at 1

120
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Seward's yes

121
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:13,599
Systems not so much in Chicago didn't seem like the town you picked to go first

122
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
Not if you thought typography meant any

123
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
Chicago built on a swamp

124
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Street-level

125
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Water level

126
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
What's the same thing

127
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:25,887
You put Seward under the street there's no way for the material in them do you know run down peeling dead

128
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,031
Chicago was ready to try anything

129
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
Chesbro said okay

130
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
What's Jack street level up Tempe

131
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,711
It was a time when engineers' were really seen as the savior

132
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,783
It's so when he said first thought they were going to build a sewer system

133
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,367
And he said we're going to raise Chicago out 10 ft so that we can

134
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
Wooden sword

135
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,231
Everyone should let's do it

136
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,279
And there was a reason they went for it

137
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
People making tons of money

138
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
Chicago's location with perfect

139
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:02,239
Connecting the west to east through railroads in the Great Lakes and that's what the city was growing so fast that start with

140
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,615
Actually didn't jack up the street from cells they just pile dirt on top of the old streets to make them higher

141
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,687
And some of that dirt came from the river bottom which of the

142
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
Dredge to make room for

143
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,295
All of the stuff that they were about to dump in there

144
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
They did Jack up the building

145
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,951
Literally has a lot of Jack Spurs and start cranking

146
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:28,607
Bisquick picture for 1857 it shows a massive Hotel big is a city block

147
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,679
Dozens and dozens of guys crank

148
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Perfect sink

149
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:39,359
You can also see Hotel guests in Top Hat standing on the balconies a couple flights up

150
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,943
They're looking out watching their view get better and better

151
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
Corduroy hats at a time

152
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:50,623
And this kind of thing happen over and staying open while they're getting cranked up Just for kicks

153
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
Another fancy hotel

154
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
1200 guys

155
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
Cranking away all at once

156
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:02,911
Foundation at top speed literally working around the guys with the jacks

157
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,031
Did another great picture of a huge downtown block of stores in Austin

158
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,335
All 35000 tons

159
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
Jacking up the street and Building Supply

160
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
20 years to finish

161
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,735
But by that time project number 2 with already done

162
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:23,135
Because it didn't take too long after the sewers went in for Chicago to realize that there was a big question that they hadn't given enough

163
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,671
Start 2 on the first go-round

164
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
We're did the sewers take all this out

165
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Into the river

166
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
And where the river

167
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,839
And it'll wake and where was the drinking water coming

168
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,679
It's okay such as bro how about this

169
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
Who build water intake

170
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
2 miles out from Shore

171
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
Way past where the river

172
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
Don't turn Mac into the lake

173
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,943
And I don't mean digging the biggest deepest longest tunnel Everett

174
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
What do you think

175
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:53,343
They all said fine and they did it and it was amazing the city is growing people making money

176
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
And everybody agrees they'll do whatever it takes

177
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
Keep this thing rolling

178
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
So it's on round 2

179
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Digging the tunnel

180
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
In 1864

181
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
Checkers guide

182
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
Start digging the tunnel out from the city

183
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
60 feet down from street level

184
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
After that

185
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
Install a giant structure

186
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
2 miles out in the lake they call them

187
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,103
Crabs and start digging a tunnel in from under that

188
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
Back towards Shore

189
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
The work went on around the clock from both sides

190
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,247
One true dug by hand for 16 hours a day

191
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
Tentacruel bricklayers

192
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,623
The graveyard shift showing up the area that had just been dug out

193
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
In November 1860

194
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,183
5 the two sets

195
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
Ted Cruz net in the middle

196
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,815
Center this is before GPS

197
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,119
You know this is just Ball by side

198
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,911
Everybody agreed with a

199
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
Genius and a half

200
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
Except they hadn't really solve the problem

201
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
And they were dumping more

202
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,199
Of their business into the river than ever

203
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
Which

204
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
Stank

205
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,807
And before the water for the new intakes even started flowing

206
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,135
The union Stockyards open on the River South Branch

207
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Up the ante

208
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,279
320 Acres of slaughterhouses and meat packing plants

209
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
All of them

210
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
Dumping whatever they couldn't use and

211
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,143
Just imagine what that would be

212
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Into the river

213
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
For the estimated the Stockyards were

214
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
The equivalent of a

215
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
A million people in the city

216
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
Yeah that's true

217
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,199
That bit of the South Fork still goes by the name and got then

218
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
Bubbly Creek

219
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,807
All the discarded animal stop wood rot at the bottom of the river

220
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,135
And eventually about methane which would double up to the surface and burst

221
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
Also

222
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
Sometimes a confiar

223
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
And sometimes the sewage

224
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,559
Got swept more than 2 miles out and found the water intakes

225
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,143
Later they dig these even further out there's one called The Four Mile Creek

226
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,751
And meanwhile the city kept growing by 1880 we're talking half a million people

227
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,287
End producing more X

228
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
The Stockyards group 2

229
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
A lot

230
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
When engineer would say

231
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,991
Chicago produces more filth per capita than any other City

232
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,295
And now typhoid was going to be a problem

233
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,391
Turn Chicago started pushing for a new state law to help undertake the biggest

234
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Baddest

235
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
Craziest idea ever

236
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,303
They decided to dig a gigantic new Canal that would reverse the river entirely

237
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,119
Reversing the river would bring in fresh water from the leg

238
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,727
And keep Chicago's mug from polluting the drinking water pulled from that same leg

239
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
And

240
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,311
Flush all the sewage down to the Illinois River

241
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,615
Which would then take it out to the Mississippi

242
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:29,759
It took a few years to get the new law prude the town of Joliet so a river of crap coming its way and try to mix it

243
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
And then it took a few more years

244
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,343
To get plans laid out in contract issue

245
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
Red shovel day

246
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
September 3rd 1892

247
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
More than a thousand people came out to watch

248
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,071
An official took one cut with a nickel-plated shovel

249
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,887
And then an engineer detonated to massive loads of dynamite

250
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
Dynamite was there

251
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
Preferred weapon

252
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Environment

253
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:56,127
And it was on round 3 in the Epic struggle against Chicago zonex Grita

254
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
Reversing the river

255
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
28 miles of canal

256
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Price tag

257
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,039
31 million and change in today's money

258
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Almost 20

259
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
3 billion dollars

260
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,719
8700 guys working at a time with work going on year round

261
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
And tons of dynamite

262
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,327
You can hear the blast downtown when the wind was

263
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:22,239
An enormous machine some invented special for the project including a 640 wide

264
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
Master conveyor

265
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Broke after less than a year

266
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,871
During the 1893 World's Fair tourist

267
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
By the thousands

268
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,199
Day trip out to the construction zone

269
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
They would

270
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,551
Take boats and trains out to the site to see the work

271
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
If people are coming to Chicago and they were like

272
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
You got to see this

273
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Yeah this town is

274
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
And they'll do anything to survive

275
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:49,375
Even after the theater closed train companies ran morning special so local sightseers could check out the big machine

276
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
And those ever-popular Dynamite blast

277
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
This was an amazing

278
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
New project

279
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,799
You know so many people know about the Panama Canal but it was

280
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Really

281
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
In building this canal

282
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
I figured out everything

283
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Pennywise in the

284
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
And a lot of the engineers

285
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
In the game

286
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
St.Louis got gas

287
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,695
We're talking 1899 all major digging has been done for years

288
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:19,327
And the fine-tuning stuff is getting wrapped up all the construction of bridges and extra digging in the river Downstream

289
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Akira Chicago

290
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,399
Water for the Mississippi and whatnot

291
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,215
Is very very close to finish

292
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,799
And this is when st-louis figures out that all that water

293
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
Carrying who knows what

294
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
Is headed

295
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Down the Mississippi

296
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Upriver of St Louis

297
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
Depends on the river for drinking water

298
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,271
And for Brewing Budweiser beer

299
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,575
The city authorizes attorney

300
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,159
Prepare a lawsuit asking the US Supreme Court

301
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,463
Stop the Sanitary District of Chicago

302
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,511
From opening up the dance

303
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
And letting that water go

304
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Thing is

305
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
It takes awhile to get a lawsuit ready

306
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
A few months

307
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:59,007
And Chicago start humping it to get the Dam's ready to open for St Louis can get an injunction

308
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
New Year's Day

309
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
1900

310
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
Sanitary District trustees

311
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
Decide the major work is done

312
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
The next day

313
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
January to

314
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
They head out to a spot on the city's Southwest side

315
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,111
Religious one little temporary Dam holding back the river

316
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
British massive

317
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,951
28 mile Canal that's waiting for that water

318
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
The trustees arrived at dawn

319
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
One of them bring shovel

320
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,351
Most of these projects have these beautiful gold shovel

321
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
But one of the trustees

322
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
Just stopped at a hardware store and bought the

323
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
Timmy old

324
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
Rihanna work show is like stopping at Home Depot

325
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
Hey it's 5 in the morning

326
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,639
I had an awful time getting the shovel this time of day says any laid them out

327
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
Couple reported are taking notes

328
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
At least they try to

329
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,319
First off you should note that was in January in Chicago so

330
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
You know you don't shovel anything

331
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,463
That would said that the ground was absolutely Frozen and they were going to actually know where

332
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
So they bring in a dress

333
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Which also goes nowhere

334
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
So they go get some Dynamite

335
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,655
Which is a dud

336
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
There was a lot of profanity

337
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
Number one

338
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,823
Trustees control it out and then the dynamites not working and then the shovels I work

339
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
Working in the end you know this was like

340
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,967
An insult to the kind of masculinity that I can't we can even you know open this thing up

341
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
A couple hours later

342
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
Pain in the morning

343
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,575
And maybe a hundred people have gathered

344
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
And the dredge

345
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Get to work

346
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,183
Just get good Scoop

347
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
And it grabs it

348
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
Yeah baby

349
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:31,423
Dammit water starts dropping into the canal 24ft

350
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
Straight down

351
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
And where it goes

352
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,311
It is the Niagara of Chicago one of the trustees says

353
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:42,943
Almost there but there's still one last and open up and down the river which needed the governor's okay

354
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479
It's a gate that's already been made

355
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
It's just a matter of turning the

356
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
We all set

357
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
And once the gate was

358
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,343
Open the water could not be

359
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,975
Meanwhile St Louis is still during a lawsuit

360
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,559
They're always worried about Saint Louis actually file a lawsuit that would stop

361
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
That was enjoying them

362
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
From actually opening it

363
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,935
This day I can't figure out why

364
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
Why they were so slow about it

365
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,871
Chicago still had to jam a few last pieces into place to get the governor's okay took 2 weeks

366
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
St Louis could have filed any day

367
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
And then

368
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
January 17th

369
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,807
Trustees took one more early morning track to lower the dam

370
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
They turn the crank

371
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,391
Pose for a picture in their fancy coats and top hat

372
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,695
Then put it back to Chicago for a big ones

373
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,303
Bother eating and got where the st. Louis had indeed file for an injunction that day

374
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
Too late

375
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
They brought a knife

376
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:37,471
To a gunfight they brought a little piece of paper into a torrent of fight

377
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
Late I might add

378
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
They waited till just after the flood gates were open

379
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
I can understand that

380
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Legal philosophy

381
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,943
The story made the New York Times with the headline

382
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,015
The water in the Chicago River now resembles liquid

383
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,575
St.Louis push their case to the US Supreme

384
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,951
Chief justice Oliver Wendell Holmes noted that it is a question of the first magnitude

385
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,535
Weather the destiny of the Great Rivers is to be the sewers

386
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
Of the cities along their back

387
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,887
Which is an important philosophical question but

388
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
To paraphrase the waitresses on Spanish that opinion

389
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Whatever man

390
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,079
Settling a question that big it wasn't really the courts job especially

391
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,943
Since Missouri allowed St Louis and other towns to dump sewage into the Mississippi and send it

392
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
Straight to Memphis

393
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,551
So in a very real sense there was no stopping it

394
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:29,183
The canal and River reversal was later called a civil engineering Monument of the millennium

395
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,535
It was a functional Monument to our dominion over the natural world

396
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
Or so we thought

397
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,143
Fast forward a hundred years right about now

398
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,215
And the forces of nature are looking for another go-round

399
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:45,567
There have been some big efforts to clean up the river itself in the last two decades

400
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,407
And by 2015 the treated sewage is actually supposed to get disinfectant

401
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,247
When Rich cahan liability bubbly Creek looking for bubbles

402
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,063
We may have seen Signs of Life there instead

403
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,343
I see bubbles

404
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
I think that's a fish

405
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Is it

406
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
Write down there

407
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,863
It's some kind of living thing right there

408
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Yes

409
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Yes

410
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Yeah

411
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,527
But now we're living in a time of the big 19th century interventions in nature

412
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,831
Seemed poised to Boomerang back at us

413
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,391
Water levels in Lake Michigan have fallen

414
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,463
Please for now to the point where gravity may stop

415
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
Pulling Lake water into the river

416
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
Potentially reversing

417
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
The river

418
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
If there were no

419
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
Engineering interventions

420
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,239
Chicago

421
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:51,103
There are other ways to keep the water and treated sewage flowing away towards the Mississippi

422
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
But Falling lake levels

423
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,479
This is most of the freshwater in North America

424
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
And a lot of people

425
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
Link discount falling lake levels

426
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
The climate change in the hole

427
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
Catalog of horror that comes with it

428
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
Payback

429
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,791
Exactly the kind of project that reversing the Chicago River stood for

430
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,887
We can just do whatever we want to plan and get away with it

431
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,959
And I think that's a completely valid lesson you could take from this

432
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,543
Hubris involved in reversing a river

433
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:26,943
Or manipulating the environment to suit our needs is exactly what is wrong with us as stewards of this planet

434
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
But taking another view

435
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,575
You could also see this as a lesson in the lengths we will go

436
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
To survive

437
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,671
If we harness that nineteenth-century moxie

438
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
Kind of moxie that makes you think

439
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
That you could and should

440
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
Reverse a river

441
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,095
And we added that the knowledge we gained since then

442
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
We could guide our best and brightest

443
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,959
To engineer The Impossible

444
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
No matter what it takes

445
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
And we would take day trips

446
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
Out to the far Edge

447
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
Cheer them on

448
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
As they save us

449
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
I'm getting buried

450
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
In our own

451
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
Or we can produce light

452
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
Maybe okay to

We are project of 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco

455
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,711
In the American Institute of Architects in San Francisco

456
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
Between the beats

457
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,087
Bongs and chatter of our devices

458
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,671
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

459
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:48,095
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

460
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,191
All hearing that voice

461
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Technology

462
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
She talked to us

463
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,031
It is a creation of Sonic trash

464
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,103
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

465
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,687
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

466
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,735
To make them more human

467
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
Turn the living room lights on

468
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Okay

469
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
Dim the living room lights to 50

470
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
2%

471
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Okay

472
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,375
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

473
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,423
Makes for a much more natural

474
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Experience

475
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
Turn the living room lights on

476
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
Dim the living room lights

477
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
50%

478
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:37,759
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

479
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,575
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

480
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

481
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:48,255
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th right here

482
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
We need to talk about something

483
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:59,007
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating you tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet

484

Size routine

485
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,823
Thinking about it all the time is frustrating

486
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,199
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

487
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,599
And you don't know why then it may be time to seek help go to oh my God. Info podcast

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

498

A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

499
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,704
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

500
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
That whines through a

501
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

502
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
We're looking the part

00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
Might cost you your life

504
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:12,480
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

505
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,832
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

506
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:21,184
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

507
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,536
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

508
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,840
Actually if I'm being honest

509
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,888
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

510
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:37,568
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

511
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,896
Was found dead in my private gym

512
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,224
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

513
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,576
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

514
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,600
Now

515
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,648
I need to clear my name

516
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,048
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
