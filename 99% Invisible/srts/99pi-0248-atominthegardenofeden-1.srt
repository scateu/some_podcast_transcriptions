I'm Roman Mars

26
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,472
At the end of World War II

27
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,264
As the world began to process

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,824
The powerful and devastating effects of the bombings

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
Hiroshima and Nagasaki

30
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,920
Humankind entered a new era

31
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,016
Enero defined by the destructive potential of nuclear weapons

32
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,552
And the global arms race

33
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
To acquire them

34
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,928
Ghostface without Panic the reality of our time

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
Preparing for survival

36
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:45,472
My understanding and well the violent applications of atomic weights

37
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
Search had already been proven

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,872
Governments and scientists suspected Atomic science also held promise for good

39
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:57,504
Peaceful applications that could bring the world into a new age of scientific progress and Technology

40
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
It is not enough

41
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,112
To take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers

42
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,720
If must be put into the hands of those who will know how

43
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,768
Do strippers military cases

44
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
The Arts of peace

45
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:17,984
Let's President Dwight Eisenhower addressing the UN in a 1953 speech titled Atoms for Peace

46
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
In it he proposes creating an agency to oversee and promote safe secure and peaceful nuclear technologies

47
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,992
While also continuing to build up the United States arsenal of nuclear weapons

48
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,576
That agency created in 1957 was called

49
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,392
The international atomic energy Association

50
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,184
Experts would be mobilized

51
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,512
To apply atomic energy to the needs of agriculture

52
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,816
Another peaceful activity

53
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
These efforts to find peaceful applications for nuclear research would spur growth in nuclear energy

54
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,312
Which now provides around a fifth of the United States electricity

55
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,384
And expanded use of nuclear medicine

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,248
Giving us Imaging techniques and therapy still used for cancer treatments today

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
That's our own Sharif Youssef

58
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,392
But then there were ideas that seem kind of crazy in hindsight

59
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:11,232
1 science writer thought nuclear Alchemy was possible

60
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,072
That we would have nuclear factories that manufactured gold

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
He also believed we could create artificial Suns to control the weather

62
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,288
And others believed we could shower plants and ionizing radiation

63
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,592
Can you take them into better

64
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
Stronger crops

65
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
But unlike the others

66
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
That one

67
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Actually happen

68
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,552
When I ran across it I was just kind of gobsmacked

69
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
You know I was just done

70
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
I meant

71
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
So surprised

72
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
I mean there was very little

73
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
Scholarly writing about it

74
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,024
That's Paige Johnson

75
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
I have a hobby of

76
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,472
History of gardens Johnson is one of the few experts on the often forgotten Atomic Gardens of a 1950s

77
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
He's in 60s

78
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:59,360
Gardens that use radioactive materials in attempts to mutate in breed new plants

79
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
I would benefit

80
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,456
Mankind people kind of assumed it was some sort of a conspiracy

81
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,528
Oh this was all hidden from the public wasn't it

82
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,624
And this is a part of the CIA or it was a part of the propaganda age

83
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Actually it wasn't

84
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
It was widely talked about in speeches

85
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
It was written about in popular mag

86
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,839
Magazines Atomic Gardens have been largely forgotten

87
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,399
But they weren't top secret government projects

88
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
Purposely obscured from

89
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,751
They were right out in the open

90
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
And they produced

91
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
New kinds of fruit

92
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
Sand grains and vegetables

93
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,919
That we still have on our grocery store shelves today

94
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,527
Botanic Gardens of the 1950s and

95
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,855
These were part of a broader interest in atomic research that ramped up

96
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
During and after World War II

97
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,951
But they were also part of a much older

98
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,511
Debris better heart ear crop

99
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,583
Humans have been messing with plans to suit our needs

100
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,119
This for a long time

101
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,959
But you understand the history of using radiation to mutate

102
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Plants

103
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,543
We need to take a step back to the 1920s

104
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
And a relatively new technology of the

105
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
X-ray

106
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,479
In 1927 Herman Miller conducted a famous genetics

107
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
Where dispose fruit flies

108
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
X-rays

109
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,831
A form of ionizing radiation

110
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:18,719
So basically ionizing radiation is just a nice form of electromagnetic radiation that has the power to

111
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
How to penetrate matter

112
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
So it has the ability

113
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
Potentially go inside the cell

114
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
Can actually alter the genetic

115
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
Material

116
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,215
The x-rays change the genetic makeup of some of the fruit flies

117
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
And some of those changes

118
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
It's those mutation

119
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
We're heritable

120
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,871
Meaning that they could be passed along to the Next Generation

121
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
In the 1920s and 30s

122
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
Some plant breeders started using x-rays on plant

123
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,903
And hope so they could induce mutations that can make them grow faster or produce more fruit or create interesting

124
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Flowers

125
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
But enthusiasm for those techniques

126
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
This would soon die down

127
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,607
And for a while the world lost interest in how radiation could alter plan

128
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,655
Fast forward 2 World War

129
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
In a top-secret mission spearheaded by the US government

130
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
The Manhattan

131
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,103
A new branch of the Army Corps of Engineers was established

132
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
To administer work on military uses

133
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
The US began doing research not only on how to make atomic bombs but what their effects might be

134
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
After the nation

135
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
In concert with a kind of

136
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Weapon base

137
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Experiment

138
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,303
They have started to try to try to monitor what the effect

139
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,167
Of the nuclear radiation in Fallout would be on plants and animals

140
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,775
Well that research continued after the war in a project called operation cross

141
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,895
What are US tested nuclear bombs around a small cluster of islands in the Pacific

142
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
The Bikini Atoll is where the US

143
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
Testing the atomic bomb

144
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,599
And that's the first place where they really start intentionally

145
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
Planting play

146
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
And seeing how their effect

147
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,511
Researchers wanted to find out how plants would respond to the Heat

148
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
And the cameras but the bombs came off

149
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,655
The US also duck boats nearby filled with rats and goat

150
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Awesome pics

151
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,983
See the effects of bombs on living animals

152
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
A lot of them.

153
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,079
On the blast as well as the radiation

154
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,663
But there were other strains of nuclear research going on much

155
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,943
Closer to home

156
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
Particularly in National Lab

157
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,855
For the government was willing to throw funding at the new Hot Topic of nuclear science

158
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,183
Even if those projects were directly related to weapons

159
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
Enter the Atomic Garden

160
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,583
Add a new quest to alter genetic material in plants

161
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
Something we're still doing today

162
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,679
Modern genetic

163
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,703
Education techniques

164
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,799
We have the ability to go in and very carefully slice the genome with the scalp

165
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,383
The radiation experiments B Tomic Gardens were essentially just

166
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,687
Getting the genome with a hammer and see what would happen

167
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,271
What are the most fascinating examples of us

168
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
Research was happening at Brookhaven National Lab

169
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:58,463
So the gamma Gardens of Brookhaven in New York for probably the largest Gardens in the US governmental ever

170
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
Devoted to Atomic radiation

171
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
Plants

172
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:05,119
The Brookhaven gamma Garden was created in 1949

173
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,191
And its original goal was to study the effects of

174
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,751
Prolonged exposure to gamma rays on plant

175
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,407
But eventually they begin to research whether they can use gamma Gardens to induce beneficial mutation

176
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,503
The essence of gammagard is it looks like a big circle

177
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:27,135
I'm with pie-shaped wedges and at the very center of the pie is a radioactive

178
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Eversource

179
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:33,535
It was usually contained in a pole and would be raised above the level of the ground

180
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,887
The column Gardens actually makes them sound smaller than they were

181
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:43,519
Many of these gamma Gardens were five acres in size so they were really massive installations

182
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
Because of the wedges

183
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,151
When viewed from above almost looks like a symbol for radiation Danger

184
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,735
The center pole contain the radioactive isotope

185
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Usually

186
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Kobalt 6

187
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,879
That would shower the field with gamma radiation for about 20 hours a day

188
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,951
When it was time for researchers to go in and see the results

189
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,303
They would lower the source into an underground bunker made of concrete or lead

190
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,095
Step inside the Fieldhouse

191
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
Defense

192
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
And inspect the plants arrayed around the center

193
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,263
Generally the at the very front of the source almost all those plants

194
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
Die

195
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
Pretty much where they be shrunken and shriveled

196
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,895
As you got back towards the back of the

197
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
Glad you see plants

198
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,783
Sober living that might look normal but which were going to be evaluated

199
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
To see if they had any abnormal growth

200
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,183
Mutations naturally randomly occur in every living cell

201
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
Adhere the researches

202
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,279
For Henry the place with radiation in an attempt to

203
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,095
Increase that rate of mutation in the plant's DNA

204
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,679
So in a sense the scientist hope to speed up evolution

205
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,287
They were hoping to create crops that could withstand harsh growing condition

206
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,639
Never more resistant to disease that can produce more food

207
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
To help feed the world

208
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,247
I was struck again by just what are utopian Quest

209
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,671
Rebuild plant than in World famine and make the world they even use this language

210
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
Smiling Garden of Eden

211
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,279
This Quest wasn't just taking place in the US

212
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
By the late 1950s

213
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
Similar experiments for happening around the world

214
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
In Norway

215
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,495
Sweden Costa Rica and the Soviet Union

216
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
Among other places

217
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
And that all of these efforts were run by the government

218
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
Fancy research universe

219
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,943
Somewhere done by curious citizens

220
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:33,599
The Atoms for Peace movement began to support the idea that home experimenters could run their own nuclear projects

221
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,999
As part of its Atoms for Peace effort it was really actually designed to enable Atomic entrepreneurship is

222
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
1215 starling

223
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,863
You know it's like kind of if the startup culture. Today existed

224
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
Only you can get a radioactive source

225
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,495
Switch to run your startup company

226
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
In the late 1950s

227
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:57,151
An oral surgeon in Tennessee became one of these atomic

228
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Entrepreneur

229
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
His name was CJ's

230
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Skis

231
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,343
Annie build a little bunker in his backyard where he started a radiating seed

232
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:09,439
And selling them to home gardeners and two children looking for science fair

233
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,535
These irradiated seeds weren't dangerous to handle

234
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,839
Just because something's been irradiated doesn't make

235
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Get Radioactive

236
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,471
One of species biggest clients was an English woman named Muriel Howard

237
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
It was an Enthusiast of all things

238
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Atomic

239
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
And all things gardening

240
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,663
Tri-form something called the atomic gardening Society

241
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,735
And its purpose was really to engage

242
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
I'm the lady gardener

243
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
In the sorts of atomic

244
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
Experiments that were taking place the National Lab

245
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,719
So she wanted to provide them with irradiated seeds

246
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,071
And they would hopefully discover useful mutations in people's

247
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,983
People could become members of her Atomic gardening society and Merle would ship out the irradiated seeds and ask them to see

248
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
Send back any data they could about the plants

249
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,591
This is really an early example of crowdsourcing

250
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
That's what she was doing

251
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,687
And her Atomic gardening Society was just

252
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:07,807
One of Howard's efforts to get people involved and interested in nuclear science

253
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
Previous to the forming Atomic Garden

254
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,927
Society she had published something called the atomic Digest

255
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,511
Byline was safeguarding the atom for the Layman

256
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,583
That digest was part of another Society

257
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,983
She started called the atomic Society for the Layman Albert Einstein to be the first patron of her Society

258
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,591
She was invited to Gatherings of the Nobel Laureate

259
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,175
Who acknowledged her to say our goals are much like yours

260
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,527
A lot of atomic scientists like the idea that their work was being used for something

261
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Besides making bombs

262
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,623
So the atomic scientists were very concerned

263
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,975
Did the power of the atom would be kept kind of only for evil and only for weaponry

264
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:51,071
And felt like the safest route for it was for it to be brought out into the open

265
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
An into the realm of the laborers

266
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,143
Person in into these more peaceful

267
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
What causes

268
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,495
Imperial certainly made great efforts to help his cause

269
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,567
She had a lot of atomic Gatherings an event

270
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:07,199
So there were film screenings I'm about an ectopic Sarah lectures

271
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,735
I'm never parties

272
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,087
And she was particularly unique and that she spoke explicitly to women about this

273
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
In 1950

274
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,927
She even saved an elaborate

275
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,255
Performance in which actors pantomime the basic structure

276
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
Picture of an atom

277
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
And it was reviewed by some

278
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
Pretty major publication

279
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
So here is the review of a

280
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
The performance in Time Magazine

281
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
Before select audience

282
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,823
250 raptor ladies and it doesn't faintly board gentleman

283
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,895
713 bosomy atomic energy assoc

284
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,503
It's in flowing evening gowns gyrated gracefully about a stage and Ernest imitation of

285
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Atomic forces

286
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,671
By the 1960s popular interest in atomic gardening was coming to an end

287
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,975
Members of the atomic gardening Society group

288
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,559
Tired of seeing very few promising results from their seeds

289
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,631
It was extremely rare to get a beneficial mutation

290
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
Invitations were hard for

291
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
People without sign up

292
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
If you're training to detect

293
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,799
Backyard Atomic gardening basically reached its

294
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
E-quick Mario power

295
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,919
Radiation plant breeding didn't completely die

296
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
Disappear

297
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,831
Japan has an Institute that uses our radiation field very similar to the Brookhaven gamma Garden

298
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:23,743
Any International atomic energy Association and the food and agriculture organization of the United Nations

299
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
David Joyner

300
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
Plant breeding team

301
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,375
Still conducting research with radiation today

302
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,935
And there are still varieties of plants in our food system

303
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
I'm thinking about from radiation experiment

304
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
A strain of durum wheat Italy

305
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
Varieties of rice throughout Asia

306
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
Certain pairs in Japan

307
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,431
And a breed of sunflower in the US

308
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
Just to name a few

309
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:50,111
Also the Rio star grapefruit came about because of radiation breeding experiments and now accounts for about 7

310
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
25%

311
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
At the grapefruit grown in Texas

312
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,255
A producer Delaney Hall used to live in Texas

313
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
And can confirm that it is delicious

314
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
Yeah I can confirm that it is

315
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,751
But despite some successes

316
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,871
Radiation plant breeding never managed to live up to its ideals of ending famine

317
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Intermingle world into a quote

318
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,967
Smiling Garden of Eden

319
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
Basically after the 60s

320
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,831
It was clear that things didn't live up to their promise

321
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,391
It definitely didn't live up to exasperate

322
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:30,559
That's Helen and Curry I'm a senior lecturer in the history and philosophy of science at the University of Cambridge

323
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,631
She's also the author of evolution made to order

324
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,471
Plant breeding and technological innovation in 20th century America

325
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:42,847
Curry thinks that over time especially as environmentalist movement started

326
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:48,991
People may have become less intrigued by and more wary of all things new clear

327
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
Including radiation breeding

328
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
Weather it's going to create

329
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,159
Horrible things in the field that I might not want to ever eat anyway

330
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,487
I'm I wonder if radiation lingers on the seeds in my

331
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
Pose a threat to me

332
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,839
So I think this view becomes much more mix

333
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Text about

334
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
What does the

335
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Possibilities

336
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,055
Some historians believe that the Atoms for Peace movement was just a cover anyway

337
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:17,407
A way to put a positive spin on Atomic research at the US continue to build up

338
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
Its nuclear Arsenal

339
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,759
When Eisenhower assumed office in 1953

340
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,063
The US had about 1000 nuclear weapons

341
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,111
We left in 1961

342
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
There were around

343
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
18

344
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:33,023
Eisenhower needed people to believe that there was hope and nuclear research

345
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
Not just fear

346
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,655
So that we wouldn't turn away from nuclear weapons completely

347
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:44,031
He wanted us to keep pursuing nuclear technology even if it scared us

348
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,103
Because the Soviets were certainly pursuing it

349
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
And I was even scarier

350
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
At the time

351
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
But this March

352
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
Toward mutually assured

353
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,599
Destruction would leave us with other world-changing non-military Innovations to

354
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
Like nuclear power

355
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,695
Expanded field of nuclear medicine

356
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Course

357
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
The unarguably delicious

358
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Rio star grapefruit

359
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,495
Paid Johnson run the blog Garden history girl

In the nanotechnology company 1090

361
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
She's also collecting oral histories of the backyards

362
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,711
