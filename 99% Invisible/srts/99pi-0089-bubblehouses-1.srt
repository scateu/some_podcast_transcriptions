I'm Roman Mars

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,440
In 1941 the journalist and screenwriter Leo rosten Road

28
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,768
Is Hollywood as an Istanbul or Sioux Falls

29
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:42,144
The rich hasten to express their wealth in betray their fitful groping for status

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,496
By erecting homes of unnecessary magnitude and splendor

31
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,288
The man who built

32
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
Many of Hollywood's homes of

33
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,616
Unnecessary magnitude

34
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
Splendor

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
Was Wallace Neff

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
Neff was a starchitect

37
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,368
I know many people find the term starchitect a pretty contemptible portmanteau but never really was both famous in his

38
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,720
His own right and an architect to the Stars one of his most famous projects

39
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
The renovation

40
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,632
The state owned by the iconic silent film actress Mary Pickford and her husband Douglas Fairbanks

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,936
When a couple moved into Pickfair

42
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
The house sat on a nameless Street

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,288
Empty neighborhood called Beverly Hills

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,616
If you were lucky enough to be invited to dinner at Pickfair

45
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,432
You might find yourself seated next to Babe Ruth

46
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
King of

47
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
Spain or Albert Einstein

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
Life magazine called Pickfair

49
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,880
Only slightly less important than the White House

50
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
Much more fun

51
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,816
Best Los angeles-based reporter David Weinberg for Charlie Chaplin Judy Garland and Groucho

A blonde from

55
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
Reese Witherspoon

56
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:00,736
She actually honestly and we could have fact check this the living Ranch in Ojai

57
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,040
Jeffrey head is an architectural historian

58
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
And the author of a book on that

59
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,160
I checked and Reese Witherspoon does infect on the Libby Ranch

60
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:13,024
At the end of his life Wallace Neff could have lived in a grand estate on the coast tour

61
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,072
Huge mansion in the Hollywood Hills

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
But instead

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,168
He lived in a 1000 square foot

64
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
Concrete bubble

65
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,264
Enough believe that this simple Dome

66
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,568
Was one of his greatest architectural

67
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
The story of the bubble house begins when morning

68
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
When Death was standing his bathroom

69
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Shaving

70
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,392
Is 1934 so it was probably a straight razor

71
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,488
Netflix down and noticed a small soap bubble

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
4 minutes

73
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
You reached out and touched

74
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
The bubble held firm against

75
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Fingertip

76
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
That was the moment the idea

77
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
Struck him

78
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
You could build with

79
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Are

80
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
He can build

81
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
Bubble houses

82
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,104
And never wanted to build them by the thousand

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
Near the end of the second World War

84
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,224
Architects were anticipating the postwar housing shortage

85
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
And working on very Solutions

86
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
Neff had a larger View

87
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,904
In wanted to create a solution to me

88
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
Demand for housing worldwide

89
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,280
Jeffrey Haynes book about Neff is title No Nails no Lumber

90
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Because the bubble houses

91
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Did your nails

92
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Lumber

93
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,191
Headsets that never saw the bubble houses as a way to make money

94
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495
He saw them as a social responsibility

95
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
A way to provide low-cost housing fee

96
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
He really didn't make money

97
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
Trauma in fact Spence

98
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
A great deal of money

99
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,735
Money from his other architectural practice

100
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
I input it into the bubble houses

101
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
Plusnet was already rich

102
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,135
Remember he was building mansions for the Hollywood Elite

103
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,439
And his grandfather was Andrew McNally

104
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,255
The Cartographer who created Rand McNally publisher

105
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,911
And this idea of a dome-shaped dwelling was not entirely new indigenous cultures in the Americas had certainly Explorer

106
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,311
For that territory even during this lifetime another guy Buckminster Fuller was creating his own circular solution to the housing show

107
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
A geodesic dome

108
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
Yeah and I think it was a misunderstanding people

109
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
Look at the bottle house Anythink oh

110
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,783
This is a variation on Bucky Fuller

111
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
And it's it's really not

112
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
It's more of a

113
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,927
Variation on a

114
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
Forum

115
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
Caring nature

116
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
That someone has

117
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Adopted

118
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,119
4 human scale human years

119
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,215
What was original about Nest design was the way the bubble houses

120
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
4 built

121
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
Meth invented a new method of construction

122
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
He called it are form

123
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
Here's how it works

124
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,455
First a big slab of concrete was poured in the shape of a giant coin

125
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
Now picture of giant balloon

126
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
Shape of half a grapefruit

127
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Flat side down

128
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,415
This balloon was tied down to the foundation using steel hooks

129
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
So once the

130
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
Balloon was tied down

131
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
It was inflated with

132
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,631
Through an inlet valve and it took all of five minutes to inflate it

133
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,471
After the balloon was inflated it was coated in a fine powder

134
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,287
And this this would happen before the gunite process

135
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
Yes

136
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,407
Gunite let's take a minute to talk about the magical substance that is

137
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
Gunite

138
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
Or maybe you prefer the generic term

139
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
Shotcrete

140
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,903
Yeah so the gun I was shot out of a cement gun and the gun had two hoses

141
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,535
That came together at a nozzle and the other was dry cement mix

142
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
And water in the mix

143
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
Came together under high pressure

144
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:37,567
To form the gunite when it was more than twice as strong as regular concrete

145
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
Neff Lovelace

146
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,151
What's the bloom was coded in gunite

147
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
A layer of wire mesh

148
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
Play Store for that

149
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,783
Then a second layer of gunite with spray tan and Bam

150
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
That's it

151
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,879
Two men with a balloon and a gunite machine

152
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,487
Could turn a bare patch of soil into a bubble house in less than 48 hours

153
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
And after the gunite dried

154
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
The balloon was deflated

155
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Pulled out through the front door

156
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
Soda be used again on the next top

157
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
More earthquake-proof

158
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
And even more bomb-proof

159
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
Been any traditional structure

160
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,895
Net was so confident in his design

161
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:17,759
He would often invite people to bash the walls of the bubble with a backside of an axe

162
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
Movies at the back side up for some reason

163
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
Using the backside of Acts

164
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,511
What meth like best about the bubble houses though

165
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
Was that they were incredibly cheap

166
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,863
After Neff fine-tune the air form process

167
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
He went in search of a client

168
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,727
Someone with money who would hire him to build more bubble houses

169
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
I found one

170
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Federal government

171
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
The first Waffle Houses were

172
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Done

173
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
During the war

174
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
2

175
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Create

176
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Quick housing

177
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
4

178
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
Government worker

179
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
World War II and escalated

180
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,855
Any us needed homes for military work

181
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
Turneffe convince the government

182
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,719
To build an experimental bubble house community

183
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
In a forest

184
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
Falls Church VA

185
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Virginia

186
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:06,911
In October of 1941 fbn construction on the 12 bubble houses in Falls Church

187
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
That would eventually be nicknamed

188
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,519
Igloo Village has no lighting of a

189
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
Funny condom the street

190
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
And we arrived in the daytime

191
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
But

192
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
It was still quite dark

193
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
Because they were so many trees

194
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,271
Kathy Miles grew up in one of the Falls Church bubble houses

195
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,111
When she was five years old her dad who work for the military

196
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
Drove the family into the forest

197
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
Show them a new house

198
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
He hadn't told his wife and two daughters

199
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,303
That they would be living in a village of bubbles

200
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
The woods

201
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
It was dark and damp

202
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
And isolate

203
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,215
And I can remember coming up the street and there was

204
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,079
A a cleared area with still many trees and very little

205
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Grass

206
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
Tiffany

207
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
And there were Flagstone

208
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Sounds and there was this

209
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
House

210
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
It didn't look like a house to me at that time

211
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
But there was something

212
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
Rising up from the ground

213
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
And it was white

214
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Enlarge

215
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
Had two large lumps

216
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
And they were held together

217
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
In the middle

218
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
With a smokestack

219
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
And of course I was with my parents and I don't remember what they were telling me but I'm sure it was something

220
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
That we were going to live in this

221
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
New kind of house

222
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,431
Do you remember what your mother's reaction wasn't

223
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Croissant

224
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:28,063
Her over reaction was to stay calm and carry on

225
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,671
I think she was trying to make the best of it

226
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
And hoping that we wouldn't live there long

227
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,303
Soda come to something that look like this

228
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:45,215
I think she was truly horrified The Falls Church community consisted of two single bubble houses

229
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
And 10 double bubble how

230
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
Kathy lived in one of the Double Bubble

231
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:55,455
The double bubbles were made by connecting two smaller bubbles with a rectangular cinder block structure

232
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
That house the kitchen in the bathroom

233
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
Kathy says that growing up an Igloo Village

234
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
But incredibly isolating

235
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
Animator standout

236
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
One time

237
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,255
When she was in first grade I set out to draw a picture of my house

238
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,839
And of course we colored it and I couldn't color it because

239
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,911
I kept insisting there were no white crayons

240
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
And

241
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,103
So when the teacher looked at it she kept saying it's trying to explain to me that I was supposed to draw the house

242
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
I lived it

243
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,455
And I kept saying I do live in this house

244
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
So

245
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:35,391
Finally I felt that I wasn't doing what I was supposed to and she clearly

246
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
Had no idea what I was

247
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
And of course when we passed all the

248
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Houses

249
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
Around to our friends to look at

250
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
Pictures

251
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
The other children

252
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
Laugh

253
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
And

254
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Mets

255
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
So it was

256
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,591
Pretty daunting as a and is in introduction to first grade

257
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
For me

258
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,967
And sometimes Cathy would be made to feel like an outsider in her own neighborhood

259
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
People were constantly driving into Igloo Village

260
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Tagalog

261
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
The weird families

262
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
Live deep in the woods

263
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
Inside strange Hobbit

264
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
One of the things that

265
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
All of us children

266
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,607
In the early days were uncomfortable with I think was that when we were outside playing

267
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
In the yards

268
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
People would drive up the street

269
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,775
And they again it was a dark

270
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Street with the cousin

271
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
To the trees

272
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
And they would drive up very slowly

273
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,967
And as even in the summer as they would come up the street

274
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
They would roll

275
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
The windows of the car up

276
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,623
And they would all be pressed against the glass

277
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
And you would see them pointing

278
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
It was very much a

279
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
Zoo like feeling

280
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,375
And I can even remember when I went to the zoo one time as a child

281
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,263
I remember thinking about how I felt when people were watching me

282
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,591
And I thought about how the animals were feeling

283
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
With us watching them

284
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,967
So it had that much of an effect that I was able to make that trance

285
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Esperance

286
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Life in the bubble house

287
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
Was especially hard on Kathy's mom

288
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
Because there were no straight walls

289
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
Couldn't hang pictures

290
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
Your family photos

291
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
And the circular rooms were difficult to furnish

292
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
But living in a bubble wasn't all bad

293
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Fracassi

294
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
He discovered

295
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,607
But you could easily climb up the side of the bubble

296
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:26,751
The roof I was always a climber in those days you called it the Tomboy from the hole

297
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
These houses were really weird

298
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,615
Really I believe in this area and this

299
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
Time this place

300
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,687
It was kind of Doom 2

301
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
The failure

302
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,855
Even though Igloo Village in Falls Church Virginia did not flourish

303
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,671
Neff was still able to land a few more clients

304
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
In 1942

305
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
The Southwest cotton company

306
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
Hired him to build desert colony of bubbles in Litchfield Park Arizona the Southwest cotton company provided the cotton it

307
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Goodyear used

308
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
How to make meth

309
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,471
Giant half grapefruit balloons

310
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,055
Neff also got a contract to build a bubble house dormitory

311
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
Loyola University in Los Angeles

312
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
And in 1944

313
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,199
Pacific Linen Supply Company

314
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Tiredness

315
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,271
Design the largest are form ever built

316
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
Was 100 feet in diameter

317
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
32 ft High

318
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
Messed up

319
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,231
Pacific linen bubble with its Grandeur and prime location downtown

320
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
What finally convinced the world

321
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
The airphone construct

322
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
Derived

323
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
Not just because bubbles or practical

324
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
But because they were beautiful

325
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,519
But still people just did not want to live in bubbles

326
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,103
Eventually everyone in America moved out of their bubbles

327
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
And they were all them all

328
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
All of them

329
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Except for one

330
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
Which happens to be in Pasadena

331
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
10 miles from my apartment

332
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,391
It was dark when I arrive at the bubble house

333
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,463
It's in a neighborhood of unremarkable suburban houses from the 19

334
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
30s

335
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
When I got to the front yard

336
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Side of it stop meme

337
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
My tracks

338
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,143
Smooth Dark Mount against the night sky

339
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Newsela spooky

340
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
Breathtaking

341
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Standing there looking at it

342
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,079
I immediately thought of a passage I dread and Jeffrey heads book

343
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
The passage

344
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
What about this very house

345
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,711
One turns on to a small residential street

346
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,783
Is confronted with a house that looks nothing like a

347
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,647
The fact that it has a front door and a few visible windows

348
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,463
Only adds to its incongruous

349
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Presence

350
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,071
Looking at the house which resembles a smooth mound of

351
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Hurst

352
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,703
Feels as if some ancient space station has suddenly falling from the sky

353
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
And upon Landing

354
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,055
It has mysteriously embedded itself

355
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
Into the wrong context

356
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
It's present so strange

357
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,967
Seems to have traveled through both space and time

358
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,295
That passage was written by the artist Steve Roden

359
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,111
Steve knows a lot about the Pasadena bubble house

360
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
The last 15 years

361
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
He's lived in it

362
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,047
The only reason why I drove out here to look

363
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
At the house with my wife

364
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Just because

365
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,143
Price was Sochi

366
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,215
And that the image was so strange

367
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,543
And so when we turn the corner and

368
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Saw this

369
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
Strange Brown Dome

370
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
In the middle oven

371
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Unbelievably

372
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
Conservative neighborhood

373
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
It was sort of

374
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Looks like

375
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,807
What the hell is this

376
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:25,183
Steve was fascinated by its history and all the surprises that come with living in a bubble

377
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
Like the way the light moves

378
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
The curved surface

379
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,815
That's really cool in the living room at night

380
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,631
Is when cars drive by the lights coming through

381
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
Through the window

382
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,959
Projects on the Dome form

383
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,287
It's like crazy cycle azarian or something Keynote

384
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,823
It's really amazing

385
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,919
None of the walls that separate a room in the house go all the way to the ceiling

386
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
Rick steves wife

387
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
Is in the bedroom reading

388
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,295
Fingers cast Shadows on a ceiling

389
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
He can see from the living room

390
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
But perhaps

391
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,439
The very most badass thing about living in a bubble

392
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
Is the way sound travels through

393
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,791
It becomes a whispering eye

394
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,119
When Kathy Miles and her sister were growing up an Igloo Village

395
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
They also discovered this

396
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,191
Parabolic imperfections

397
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
In the wall

398
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
And they use them

399
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
SM secret messages to

400
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,431
I think early on my sister and I learned that if you stood in certain places you could hear people whispering

401
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
And if you stood in other places you couldn't

402
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,575
And I remember conducting experiments to see where we

403
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,367
Best here and best not here

404
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,695
Just depending on whether we wanted our parents to hear us

405
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,487
Or we didn't want to be her

406
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,279
Steve loves his bubble house

407
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,095
It doesn't have the same problems that plagued The Falls Church houses

408
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,911
Guess custom furniture design for a circular room

409
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
And he's an artist

410
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
He likes standing

411
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:47,359
Given how much Steve loves his bubble when can argue that perhaps the bubble houses might have endured a different fate

412
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:51,199
If there are piloted here in California rather than Northern Virginia

413
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,503
But there are plenty of people who aren't sad

414
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,783
The bubble house have died out

415
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Like this guy

416
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,367
I think was a bad idea

417
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
Is an architect who's quite happy

418
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
Living in a world without bubble house

419
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,351
It was a good idea when it came to me some industrial uses it was a very poor idea when it came to

420
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,423
Housing and how it may very uncomfortable swelling

421
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
Heather ly dare

422
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,287
Assembly into neighborhoods and so on

423
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,943
It did not very informed by Regional by Culture by climate or any other way for Stephen us architecture works

424
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,015
When it takes into account the context of its environment

425
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
And respond accordingly

426
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Bubble houses

427
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
Their uniform

428
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,999
You can spray gun I undo grapefruit balloon in Virginia or California or anywhere else and it's going to look and function

429
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
Exactly the same

430
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
One of the shortcomings of this house

431
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
He said it's really

432
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
Mostly Focus

433
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
On the method of his contract

434
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
Stefanos took me on a tour of his office

435
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
A Spanish Colonial building

436
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
He says

437
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
An example of great Arkansas

438
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
Show me a balcony on the 2nd

439
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,479
Flor Martinez partner sometimes do work it's a favorite place of hours in that

440
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,831
We are also urbanists and we dedicate entire life fighting sprawling

441
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,879
Trying to reorganize the world properly and

442
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,463
We have nothing in front of us here with a better magnificent view of sprawl

443
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
This is our frame into the world you know

444
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,375
It's like a panoramic view of what the rest of our lives going to be about going to fix all this mess

445
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,471
Imagine if the view from this balcony with a c of bubble houses

446
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,055
Nothing but thousands of identical industrialized own

447
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
Stretching into Infinity

448
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,151
It would be a dystopian nightmare

449
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,479
And even though he lives in a world of sprawl

450
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,527
He has his office to take refuge in

451
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
This building is my walls

452
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
This a perfect building for the hot dry climate because

453
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,463
When it's 80° outside of 90 or 100

454
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
You keep the building tight clothes then it's at

455
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,839
Six-Guns after you open up doors and windows

456
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
Any events down in no time

457
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
Explain how the arrangement of the windows

458
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
Provide balanced natural light

459
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Throughout the entire day

460
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Design

461
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,871
Was based on the combination of Mediterranean and Spanish style

462
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,431
Because Southern California has a Mediterranean climate with

463
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Spanish route

464
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
These are the things the bubble house

465
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
Can't do

466
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,599
Be culturally relevant and adapt to the environment around it

467
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,511
This office was designed by an architect who spent his entire life designing buildings that did adapt to their environment and work

468
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
Culturally relevant to my surroundings

469
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
This building was designed

470
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
My wallet

471
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Snuff

472
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
Classic Wallace Neff

473
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,775
Porch this chair is actually reconstructions of Methodist and F design

474
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,591
It was his office before it belonged to Stefano

475
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:31,711
Is Stefano why he thinks meth did this complete 180 when he created the bubble house

476
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,295
Why he made something that was so antithetical to the rest of his work

477
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,623
Stefanos thinks it had something to do with the birth of modernism

478
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,951
UCF was known for Spanish Colonial houses

479
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:46,559
White thick walls with red tile roofs in a labret wrought-iron window coverings

480
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,607
The really popular in California

481
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
They're everywhere

482
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,703
But there was this new movement happening all around Neff

483
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
Architects like Noah trailer

484
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
Schindler and Frank Lloyd Wright

485
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
We're making simple boxes

486
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
Concrete

487
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Cleanline

488
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Lots of glass

489
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,431
They look nothing like next elaborate mansion

490
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,247
People were beginning to look at younger Architects Maybe

491
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
With what we know

492
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,135
Wilder ideas and more relevance maybe the daily life and so on

493
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,207
You think it was sort of like a like a midlife crisis kind of thing

494
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:19,839
ProSource I mean I I think grade argue they continue to sync their entire life and

495
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
There comes a moment in which you look

496
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,447
Look at the movement taking the world over it's like a wildfire

497
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
So you have to ask yourself

498
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:30,335
Am I the wood doesn't burn or shall I become part of the Wind

499
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,151
But the modernists were not impressed with Nest bubble house

500
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,223
Steve rodent the guy who lives in the Pasadena bubble house

501
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
Tell me almost the same thing

502
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
Young architects who are trying to like

503
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,623
Bring modernism forward

504
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,903
No they thought he was

505
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
Dilettante

506
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:50,559
You know and I think he was an outsider probably because he was hobnobbing with movie star

507
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
I mean imagine if like

508
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:58,239
Barry Manilow started a metal bands not like anyone would take that seriously

509
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,287
Right no matter how great it was

510
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,639
Ironically great but you know like what if it was great

511
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
We none of us would buy into it

512
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,271
And I think that was part of his situation you know he wasn't

513
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
Like a hipster

514
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,111
Cute he wasn't an unknown crazy dude

515
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
He was a guy with a very

516
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
Strong practice who

517
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
Made giant houses for rich people

518
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
And yet that's never stopped believing in the bubble house

519
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
He continued to make variations on it

520
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,192
Designing bubbles with straighter sides and flatter roofs

521
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,240
Ones with big holes cut out of the side

522
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,568
Even at the end of his life long after it was clear

523
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
The bubble house had no future

524
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
He saw it as when I was

525
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
Greatest architectural

526
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,480
He believed in it so strongly

527
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,808
Did he spent the end of his life living in a bubble house

528
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
In fact

529
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,880
He lived in the same house Steve Roden now live

530
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,024
I don't want to play the bubble house off as just some failed idea

531
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,864
Navigate to be a symbol of a design inspired by the highest ideal

532
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Beauty

533
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
Efficiency

534
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
Affordable housing

535
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,776
Willingness to take risks on crazy ideas

536
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
Experiment

537
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
With making the world a better place

538
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
Maybe the structure itself

539
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,480
The concrete show that house the idea was fly

540
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,784
Maybe people don't want to live in bubbles

541
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,088
But their legacy deserves reflection

542
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
And so does meth

543
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,464
The guy invented a way to build houses out of air

544
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,768
That's being awesome

545
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,560
And hardly anyone knows about him

546
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,608
All the remains of his idea

547
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
Is this one last bubble house

548
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
Jobs in Pasadena

549
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
Actually that's not entirely

550
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
True

551
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
It's the last bubble house in the United

552
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:42,688
States that were bubbles in Pakistan Egypt Liberia India Jordan Turkey

553
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:49,088
Nicaragua Venezuela Cuba there was an air form gas station in Brazil but the largest colony

554
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
