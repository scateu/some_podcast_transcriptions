This is 99% invisible

30
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
I'm Roman Mars

31
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,160
In 1914 in Manhattan

32
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,768
The city government took ownership of an apartment building belonging to a guy named David Hess

33
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
They use illegal power called eminent domain which allows governments to seize private property for public use

34
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,472
In this case they want to expand the subway system

35
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
Has fought them and laws

36
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,592
It was all said and done his building was torn down

37
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,176
And he was left with a triangle shaped piece of property

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,992
And when Roman says triangle-shaped

39
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,832
He means the property has was left with was about the size and shape

40
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
Very large

41
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
Slice of pizza

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
He was not amused

43
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,232
That's a producer Katie Mingle

44
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,560
Later the city tried to get him to donate his pizza shaped

45
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
Property so they could build

46
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Sidewalk

47
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,008
He refused again they build the sidewalk anyway and in the middle of the sidewalk is hess's triangle

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
With the tile mosaic that reads

49
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,104
Property of the Hess estate

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,152
Which has never been dedicated

51
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
Republic

52
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,016
In other words get off my triangle

53
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:35,392
Lyrics it's still there by the way on the corner of Christopher Street and 7th Avenue in the West Village

54
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
People like David

55
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
That's who refused to sell their properties are called

56
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Holdouts

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:45,376
An eminent domain only comes into play when the government wants your property for public use

58
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,752
If it's a private development that wants your place and you refused to sell there's not much they can do

59
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:56,128
Although there have been cases where eminent domain has been controversially used for private development

60
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
But that's another story

61
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,712
In China they call their holdout houses

62
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
Nail houses

63
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,856
You may have seen some of the pictures of single houses sticking up like the head of the nail

64
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,160
Everything else around them bulldozed

65
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
Hand carved owl

66
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,048
Basically anywhere there's a lot of new development there are bound to be Developers

67
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
Plans to make lots

68
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,704
And lots of money if they could just get that one stubborn person

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
To move

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
Which brings us to one of the most stubborn and

71
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
Steadfast

72
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
That's ever

73
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
Edith macefield

74
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
I always call her mrs.

75
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,808
That's Kathy Milady she's one of the only reporters who ever got an interview with

76
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
Mrs. masefield

77
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,696
Avicii achieved through unwavering persistence good manners and proper attire

78
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,536
Later I asked her I said what was it that made you decide to talk to me today

79
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
And she said I like your skirt

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,144
Edith macefield lived in a Seattle neighborhood

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
Salt Ballard

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,056
Ballard had once been its own little town until it was annexed into Seattle in 1907

83
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,848
To have the feel of a small town

84
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,920
A lot of single-family homes and small businesses

85
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,736
That started to change around 2005

86
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
When

87
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,832
Development really started to sprout

88
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,160
Terra Condominiums we started hearing some

89
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
Push back

90
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,559
From old-time residents in the neighborhood Who felt that the neighborhood was changing

91
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Too quickly

92
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
Ballard became so iconic of this type of Superfast high-density development that

93
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
Hoods we call it the

94
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
Ballard ization of my neighborhood

95
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,455
So in 2005 when Ballard was in the middle of bean Ballard I

96
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,087
A developer wanted to build a shopping center that would take up the entire block where Edith macefield have lived

97
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,879
The last 50 years

98
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
Edith macefield house was in a more industrial section of Ballard and her black was mostly empty besides

99
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
I've heard tiny house

100
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,655
Just so you can picture her house you know when you're a kid and you draw

101
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:01,055
A picture of a house using a little square with a triangle on top then you put a little front door in a couple of windows on each side

102
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
That is exactly

103
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
What Edith macefield house look like

104
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
The developers offered her seven hundred and

105
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
$50,000

106
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Monster House

107
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,087
Which was appraised at about 120000

108
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
And as you can

109
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
Probably yes

110
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
She said no

111
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
And so they said no problem

112
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,023
We'll just build arm all around you

113
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
Like literally

114
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
All around you

115
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
Hi I'm Barry Martin

116
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:32,031
I work in construction is a project superintendent so I'm just the guy out there in the sight making sure that

117
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
You don't get all gets done

118
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
Barry was hired

119
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
Oversee the shopping center project

120
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711
And he heard that some Ballard residence

121
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
Weren't happy about all the nude

122
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
But he wasn't too worried

123
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
I mean

124
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
Just a job for me

125
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
You know I didn't really think about it

126
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
You're really one way or another

127
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,511
He hadn't yet heard about Edith macefield

128
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,327
So when I got closer to where I was going to start the project

129
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,143
My wife asked me if that was the one where

130
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
There was a little lady down in

131
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
Ballard would move

132
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,031
I said no that's not it cuz you know

133
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
These guys would have told me

134
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,151
I called them up and they said oh yeah didn't we tell you

135
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
Whoever said you can't stand in the way of progress

136
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
Is never tried to step over Edith macefield

137
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
Old lady being bullied by Developers

138
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,327
The story was classic David and Goliath

139
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
Edith macefield

140
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
Versus the big bad Developers

141
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215
And Barry Martin wasn't super

142
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,799
Excited about all the extra media attention on his crotch

143
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,359
I'm thinking this is a lose-lose

144
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
Proposition because

145
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
All she has to do is

146
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
You don't complain

147
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,295
Adele somebody at the TV station or the

148
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
On the newspaper

149
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
Llamacolombia

150
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
Pretty big deal

151
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,231
But even though the press was clamoring to talk to mrs maysfield

152
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,303
She wanted nothing to do with talking to them

153
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,631
Kathy mullady had been one of the few exceptions

154
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,727
Here's mrs. masefield turning down help from a CBS reporter as she

155
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
They took out some trash in her front yard

156
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,431
As Mrs macefield thank you very much

157
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
Later in the segment

158
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
He knocks on our door

159
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
And you can hear muffled

160
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
Go away

161
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,135
Is there any chance okay

162
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,951
Unfortunately that muffled recording of a

163
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,767
Cranky mrs. masefield is the only one week

164
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Define defer

165
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
She passed away in 2008

166
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
Which will talk about more later

167
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,215
Love my second day there

168
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,287
When walking by eat his house and she was out in the front yard

169
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,127
With the flowers and her little dog that was blind

170
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,199
The workers started to demolish the few other building

171
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
Think that we're on the Block and dig up a bunch of soil that was contaminated with lead and all the while their neighbor

172
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
Mrs. maysfield

173
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
Went about her business

174
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,231
Day after day just like she'd always done

175
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,279
Should get up in the morning and feed the

176
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Bert

177
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Anthro

178
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
Bird seed on the sidewalk

179
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,423
Most of the time the bridge he would be there when we got to work

180
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,007
And if the birds eat wasn't there by 10

181
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
We knew something wasn't right

182
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
If they didn't see the birds

183
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,663
Marywood knock on her door to see if she was okay

184
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
And she would usually yell at

185
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,271
Get the hell out of there and go away and leave her alone

186
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
And I just tell her that

187
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
Okay I'm just checking on you

188
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,695
A lot of people thought that once the construction started

189
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,255
Ernest Edith macefield would fold

190
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,351
The noise and the encroachment on her privacy would just be too much

191
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
The Architects even designed the building in such a way

192
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,727
But if mrs. masefield ever decided to move

193
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,079
They can easily incorporate the space Warehouse was into the building

194
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,359
But she didn't fall

195
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,687
The developers up their offer to $1000000

196
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,759
Plus they offered to find her a similar home somewhere else

197
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
And pay for a home health care worker

198
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
She turned them down

199
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Beer past

200
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,463
In the building around Edith macefield house got bigger and bigger

201
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
The image of it was really something

202
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,095
Amazing pictures of the house especially if you're from Seattle

203
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
The building powered 40 feet above Earth

204
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
Colonel house was

205
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Was Bohr

206
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
Dirty well

207
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,591
It wasn't just a big building sitting next to a tiny house

208
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,223
It was a big building completely enveloping at Kani House on three signs

209
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,783
So close

210
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,391
Mrs masefield could practically lean out her window and touch them

211
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,463
As the building moved forward the construction workers

212
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:39,327
Checking in on mrs. masefield and occasionally bringing her lunch from McDonald's

213
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
She reportedly loved

214
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Chicken tasty

215
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
And Barry kept dropping off business cards

216
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
Telling her to call if she needed any

217
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
And then one day she

218
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
You finally did

219
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
Said that she

220
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,687
Didn't feel comfortable driving that day

221
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
Could I give her a ride to go

222
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Get her hair done

223
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,879
You don't got her in the car and started driving over there and we are kind of talking about how

224
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
Ballard was changing

225
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
And sort of

226
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,303
Edith macefield wasn't angry about the way Ballard was changing

227
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,143
Cheap wasn't even angry about the mall they were building more or less

228
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
On top

229
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Love her house

230
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
She said cuz it always changes

231
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,823
He said 20 years from now they'll be carrying this down and building something else

232
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
She said that's just the way it goes

233
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
I felt like she was

234
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
Happy that we were there

235
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,295
She said she didn't mind the noise she said I was through World War II

236
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
That's Kathy Milady again

237
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
And

238
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:41,279
She didn't mind the attention from those a young construction workers who walked by her house and the wave to her or

239
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
Smiled or checked in a little bit

240
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
She's been there for fifty years

241
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,447
That point in time know she was 86 years old

242
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
Money didn't really mean much to her

243
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
Anymore she couldn't

244
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
Move around very well

245
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
She knew where everything was in her house

246
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
She had

247
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
No reason to move

248
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
She didn't have any family

249
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
So

250
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,343
Getting the money so that she could leave it for family didn't exist

251
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,719
Mrs. maysfield didn't have any living family to leave any money to

252
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
By the same token

253
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,583
She didn't have any family to help take care of her in her old age

254
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Pretty soon bury started

255
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
R2 all of her

256
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
Lenny started making them

257
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:28,127
I got concerned that mrs. masefield who was getting more frail by the day was going to burn herself

258
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Under stove

259
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
So

260
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
I just started

261
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,503
Swing by there after work and making her dinner

262
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
Twink in a microwave so

263
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
I guess I have to

264
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
Cook for social don't have to worry about it any

265
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
Pretty soon Barry was making

266
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,719
Her lunch and breakfast as well

267
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
One day I woke up and I'm making a free meal

268
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Today

269
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
And then I had to come in on Saturday and

270
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Sunday

271
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
Because

272
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
Spending all this time together

273
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:58,591
He got to know mrs. masefield pretty well they listen to music together watch old movies

274
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
Mrs. masefield also had

275
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
Crazy stories about her past

276
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,503
She told me that she was a spy for the British

277
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
That she had been

278
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
Captured

279
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Spine

280
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
And they put her in decal

281
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,487
Then she escaped from there she also said she

282
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
Taking care of a bunch of War Orphan

283
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
England after World War II

284
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,911
And on top of all of that she claimed to know a bunch of famous

285
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
People

286
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,215
She told me Benny Goodman with her cousin

287
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
She had met

288
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,079
Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey and then played

289
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
You know saxophone and clarinet with them

290
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,455
Her stories were so incredible

291
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
But they were hard for people to believe

292
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
But they were harder to dismiss than you might think

293
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
She came across to me as

294
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Very sharp

295
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
She liked

296
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
To talk a lot

297
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
About the past

298
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,303
But she also watch the news

299
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
And new

300
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
Exactly what

301
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
What's going on

302
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,703
Barry took care of mrs. masefield

303
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
For nearly a year-and-a-half

304
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,823
Making all of her meals visiting with her on weekends and after work

305
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,127
Sometimes she call in the middle of the night

306
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
Tell him she'd had an ax

307
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
And she needed him

308
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,295
You know she had very few wishes one she wanted to die in her house

309
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,599
You live out her last days in her house

310
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
But if I wouldn't have been there

311
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
At some point in time

312
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
They would have

313
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
Put her in a state-run facility

314
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
And it wasn't a reason for that

315
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
And then she's going to

316
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
Being happy

317
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
The last days of her life

318
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
And for what

319
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,519
When she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and began to die

320
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
She finally agreed

321
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
To a home health care work

322
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
But very became / power of a

323
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Attorney

324
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
The person she put in charge of her

325
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
Her final decision

326
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:45,087
Edith macefield died in her house on June 15th 2008

327
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
She was 86 years old

328
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,439
She left her house to Barry Martin

329
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
The construction superintendent who became her friend

330
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,351
While simultaneously sandwiching your house between a Trader Joe's

331
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
In an LA Fitness

332
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,751
After she died very begin packing up her house and he look for things that would

333
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
Confirm this is masefield

334
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
Crazy stories about her

335
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,895
You never found anything about her escaping.

336
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
Caring for any War orphans

337
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,271
But he did find a Benny Goodman record

338
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
The written inscription

339
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
It said

340
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
To my cousin Edith

341
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
With love

342
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Bunny

343
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,375
After people found out that Edith macefield had left her house to Barry Martin

344
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
There were some who called him an opera

345
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,495
Ultimately it's hard for anyone

346
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
Other than Barry to know what his motivation

347
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,127
Menswear but for what it's worth I did talk to a couple of the Home Health

348
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,455
Care workers who took care of mrs. masefield before she died

349
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,015
And they both had a very high opinion of

350
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
Said he was there every day when no one else was

351
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
I love you seem to care.

352
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,903
Deeply for mrs. masefield

353
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,535
Barry eventually sold Edith macefield house to an investor who had various plans for it

354
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
None of which have materialized

355
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,167
And recently the same guy asked Barry if he'd be interested in buying it back

356
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
He said no

357
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,775
No and if I did eat it would probably

358
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
Probably hot

359
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
For that

360
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
She told me to

361
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
Hold out until I say

362
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
Got my price

363
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,223
And then to

364
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
You know

365
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,831
