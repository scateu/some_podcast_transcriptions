But I am Roman Mars

Could change everything

28
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,632

I'm in this episode that were featuring a whole lot

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,288

00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
It's super fun

33
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,616
But unlike 99percentinvisible

34
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,200
There is swearing in zigzag even I swear in zigzag

35
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
So I just want to warn you

36
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
All right

Journalism and women in Tech

42
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,864
We're exploring these very big ideas

43
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,912
Through our own personal story

44
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,728
At this point it's late April

00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,800

We go looking for those answers in this episode

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,768
Chapter 4

54
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
Specifically we pitch

55
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,840
Sort of

56
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
A well-known angel investor

S&R blockchain Matchmaker

00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328

Car on our way to the airport

00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,216
He was going to Puerto Rico Governor Cuomo

65
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
Why are you speaking so slowly

66
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,408
Because it is 5:12 in the morning and it's taking me a little time to formulate my words

67
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,712
Politics for a local TV news station

68
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
We have two kids

69
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,600
But don't worry my mom was home with them as we scattered ourselves across the globe

70
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
I was going to San Francisco

71
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
What are you doing okay so I'm going out there will for a multitude of reasons we're going to pitch

72
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,376
A first for me

73
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,704
Going to hang out with Roman Roman Mars

74
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:59,360
For the day tomorrow in Oakland what do you think of my whole Endeavor so far are you

75
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
Aspects of it is too strong a term I'm happy for you for you

76
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
Serta following alarm

77
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,256
Like

78
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
Despite the fact

79
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
A block away

80
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
So instead

81
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
Everything conversation

82
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,215
514 on the way to the airport

83
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
It's our special time Josh

84
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,079
We should just get up every Sunday morning around 4

85
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
Take a ride to the airport and back

86
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Yes

87
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,247
Josh has been super supportive of me doing this startup thing

88
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,879
I texted our little chat to Jen who was also headed to the airport to meet me for a flight

89
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
That's really cute you guys are just fascinating I assume that Josh

90
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,399
Schleich knew every detail for some reason of what's going on with you right now so that's pretty funny

91
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
End

92
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
That's badass

93
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
That

94
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,823
You guys both are like we're both going to

95
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,431
Do your thing so police report

96
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,343
Josh and I are really lucky to have families who lived

97
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Nearby who helped out a lot

98
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
Jen doesn't have that

99
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
Most people don't

100
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
But that wasn't stopping both Jen and I from worrying how we're going to make this podcast and run a business

101
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
Steam

102
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,471
And that takes more than a cryptocurrency that doesn't exist yet

103
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
It takes cash

104
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,847
Just why

105
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,895
Jen and I decided to go on a wreck up

106
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
Mission

107
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
Trip to San Francisco

108
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,759
To see if we can find a back-up plan

109
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
A plan B

110
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,855
Because that's what responsible adults do these days

111
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,463
They'll put their savings on the line they get rich people to invest in their business

112
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:57,887
So far we've lost our first grant that was chapter one that we've been counting on

113
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,543
That was awful then we got in this other small grant that was having real money and having cryptocurrency that still didn't

114
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
This yet

115
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,127
Is like ziggety-zag Ade but like

116
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,223
Maybe it was trying to find some stability but having an investor

117
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,527
Or would that just create bigger problem

118
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
We weren't sure

119
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,999
Then I had done our fair share of reporting on tech companies that put their profits ahead of basic Humanity to a

120
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
Appease shareholders

121
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,095
But there's also the good side to Silicon Valley

122
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,935
Big Ideas can happen because people believe in them

123
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
And back then

124
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Was big money

125
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
Okay we just landed here is our planet it's jam-packed we were meeting with an angel investor named Jesse

126
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
Torelli that afternoon

127
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,575
And I guess we're going to catch her

128
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
Our plans see if she gets it hopefully she will

129
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,839
And then say what are the next what's the next move

130
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,399
Flowers and shower later

131
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,727
Okay we are walking down 3rd Street

132
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
In the mission

133
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
To a coffee place to meet Jess Pirelli

134
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Lucifer Ella

135
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,175
She was an early development strategist

136
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
@twitter

137
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,503
You've done your homework Jen poyant

138
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,831
Go to the copy shop we were going to meet Jess a little early

139
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:26,463
We just could not stop talking about what we had seen on our walk to the coffee shop

140
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,303
It's definitely the most extreme version of wealth disparity that I've ever seen

141
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
In America

142
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,679
Yeah look down and person after homeless person is lying in the streets

143
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
Look up and there are spiffy

144
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,591
Extremely wealthy people zipping by on motorized scooters and their athleisure wear

145
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,711
Jen and I had to abruptly end our conversation about the economics of San Francisco

146
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
Just arrived

147
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,647
We all agreed that the cafe was way too noisy

148
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:00,511
We grabbed some iced coffees to go

149
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
I went down the block to Jesse's apartment building

150
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
Thank you

151
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,911
She said we could talk in the conference room by the lobby

152
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,543
Is San Francisco show apartment buildings have conference

153
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
Yeah hi I'm Jessica Borelli

154
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,431
We were connected through a mutual friend

155
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
Crystal sacca

156
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,015
Who I've known for a long time

157
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,135
Founding partner of hashtag angels

158
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,975
Which is an investment Collective I co-founded with five other women

159
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
3 years ago

160
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:37,631
I spent my career working in Silicon Valley at

161
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
Twitter over eight and a half years

162
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,263
Start working for Venture Capital firm

163
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
We were frankly initially buried

164
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,407
Resistant resistant

165
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,967
We have reservations are skeptical about

166
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
Because we were a little worried about having to push for these returns

167
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
Define incentive

168
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,487
That is a smart question for you to ask and it doesn't work of us

169
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,559
You're really thoughtful founder which is

170
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
How do I make sure

171
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,447
Vision our expectations and hopes I have for my company

172
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,263
Aligned with the expectations of an investor

173
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,895
A lot of time because you get that right

174
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
Obsessed with it

175
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
Like we talked about it all the time

176
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,295
Venture capital

177
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,879
Is a great way to finance if you want hyper-growth

178
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
And so

179
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
Hyper-growth

180
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,047
It's not to be obtuse about this is is the rate of growth and the

181
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,631
I want to grow that's going to take

182
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,447
Anywhere from one to five years I would imagine

183
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
For us too

184
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:50,591
Launch 3 shows and then spend those off into those different multi-platform

185
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
But I guess the question

186
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Is the

187
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
Maybe the exits

188
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:59,551
Strategy be expected to exit all those questions about what

189
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,671
What do the investors want back like what level of growth is expected in

190
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,975
Do we have to know all that at the beginning

191
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
Generally if you're raising venture capital

192
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
At investors are looking

193
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,911
Are looking for a business that they believe

194
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Can transform an industry

195
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,543
Was this a pitch or more like a tutoring session

196
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
I guess my hope

197
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,943
And I want to be upfront about it is that we do have investors who care as deeply is

198
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
We do about the

199
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,271
You know that societal impact of the

200
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
Stuff that we make

201
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
That's really important

202
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:38,463
I mean I definitely want to be big so I think these ideas need to be big in their big ideas

203
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,303
But I also think like is there room for that to be

204
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
At this point Jen kicked me under the table

205
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Conscientious

206
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
By accident she told me later

207
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,751
But at the time I thought you wanted me to shut up

208
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
I think so I think it's all about finding that right

209
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
Set with an investor

210
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,431
And given how important that is to you and given

211
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Trump

212
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Growth

213
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:07,135
I think being as exactly as you're being rather explicit about your goals are for their send what success looks like to you

214
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
Who is going to help you find an investor

215
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
That aligns

216
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,583
And I can do you know anyone like this is sound like farfetch.

217
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,167
Wait was this weird that we were kind of pitching someone to fund our work

218
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,567
Which would basically criticized the tech platforms that they had also funded

219
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:30,687
I think these people exist I think I want to send a little bit more time with you on

220
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,551
The ambition for what you want to build and what that business and scale might look like yeah

221
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
This face should be

222
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,647
All about building a product and get a few customers

223
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:44,255
If you need money right now then you got to think a little bit about like okay what is the right sourcing

224
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,559
Whether it's revenue or Grant or seed funding

225
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,887
But if you have a time for your back in a fundraising mode

226
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,543
I think we can

227
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
But they take

228
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,199
Tapastic the process is very often very bureaucratic

229
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
And we might have

230
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,879
But that takes time to come out

231
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,791
We're definitely going to have to go into debt unless we get some Defenders I think that's basically what

232
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
No that's correct

233
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
Yeah for sure

234
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,215
She haven't looked at her watch yet but the Justice we were wasting her time

235
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
AAA

236
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:32,639
You always take care of most of the rescuer and so it's about finding the right alignment with those that believe in you and believe what you're building

237
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:39,039
Show friends and family around maybe possible so far does seem like something word

238
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:44,671
The impact investors might be the better fit but I don't want to jump to that conclusion with edges like really like

239
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
Talk through that

240
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
It sounds like you have

241
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,119
An incredible background to do this you've been successful duena Senor prior roles

242
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,031
Can I take a look at some of that

243
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,151
How big of a business is this is this the next

244
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,199
Like massive

245
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,991
Like Global Media Company

246
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:14,623
Is this the seed of something that can be really big and is that what

247
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
They want to build

248
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,951
Do they believe there's a path to doing that

249
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,791
How quickly can we come back and do that

250
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
This week

251
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,959
Cool

252
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
Talk

253
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
Decide whether we want to do that

254
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:42,015
Okay I just wanted to make sure

255
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
Yeah

256
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Absolutely

257
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
Thank you so much

258
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,263
Jen and I walked out of our meeting with

259
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Jess

260
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
Kind of stumbled

261
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
Stunned

262
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
Into the waning light

263
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
Of a crisp

264
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,943
Spring evening in San Francisco

265
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:15,295
What a weird experience we had presented a united front

266
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
To Adventure capitalist

267
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,927
But meanwhile our brains had been talking to each other like ESP

268
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
Don't do this

269
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
Do this

270
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
Do I do this

271
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Don't do that

272
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Exactly 2 hours

273
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,935
She said she'd be with us for 2 hours and 2 hours

274
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:38,335
Since that meeting by the way just has been named the newest partner at the Google back venture capital firm GV

275
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
At least you knew what you was doing

276
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,711
Jen and I needed to debrief

277
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Paint thinner

278
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,975
Isn't it just amazing words yeah

279
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
I feel like that was bad

280
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,839
You do

281
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
Why do you say that why you feel that way that's so interesting

282
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,799
Cuz it's not what I think in our guts she knew and we knew that it's not

283
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,223
Like you were like I definitely want to catch this and I was like

284
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,807
I felt pretty out of my comfort zone

285
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,463
We stayed in the media business like we both like it

286
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
We like the

287
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
People who are in it and we like the

288
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,375
Emphasis on ideas as opposed to valuation and

289
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,287
I just don't want to be thinking about money like to me the greatest luxury is not to be thinking about money

290
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,871
I can't wear business people now we have to

291
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,687
My golden is to get to where I don't have to think about money

292
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,479
My goal is not to like

293
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
Cap

294
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
Send

295
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:58,207
Tables and all that it's really not like I don't think like I really I really care very much about like make

296
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,767
Making stuff with you and feeling that creative

297
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,959
Wonder and like people feeling moved by the things that we make and like that matters a lot to me

298
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,519
Matters to me too I just don't know how we're going to do it

299
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:17,663
That leads me to okay just wasn't right like to even want to go back and actually try and picture

300
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
I mean it song

301
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
Like no

302
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
In the short-term

303
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
She kind of said like

304
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
Grants and family and friends

305
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
I think the bigger thing is what we're going to do like

306
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:36,095
We work our asses off until we watch this show and then we go back to Lake Amado are we to see where the fun

307
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
Comes in we grow it waste lower together

308
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
And there's no Lake

309
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,591
Is there shame in that I feel like we feel like there's a minnow but I just keeps telling us that that's not possible

310
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,199
Dan was a business consultant who is helping us project future budgets and Revenue

311
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,807
I mean seriously we need to have this entire conversation over again with Robin tomorrow

312
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:02,207
It's going to be it's going to be different I don't think there's any shame in that that's essentially going back to like they're real bootstrap

313
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:08,607
Remodel and then seeing where we go from there fine with that I'm fine with that which is awesome

314
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
I'm totally fine with it right then

315
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:16,287
It's weird how you eat I feel like you know there's still utilitarian in many ways there's not a ton of soul

316
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
Makes me so happy you said that

317
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,151
It really does

318
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,711
Yes dude you know I'm very much about

319
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,879
I mean not like in the not like Franklin

320
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:36,255
I think the other thing that's so strange is that we believe so wholeheartedly and Lee

321
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:41,887
We are women we could do this why don't we take that opportunity this is crazy not to

322
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,679
But it's not right for us

323
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
And that's

324
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,287
Hard that's why I feel like a disaster to me because I'm like

325
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,615
I feel like a disaster let me be clear

326
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
I'm realizing

327
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199
It's like part of me was like guess we'll put you

328
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
Because I think I'm

329
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,575
So worried about letting you down money-wise

330
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
You taking a

331
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Like

332
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
Are you at the same thing dude

333
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
Your aunt taking a big risk but your

334
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,559
You've invested a lot already into it

335
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
So I'm worried about the same thing

336
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
I mean it's not like we don't have

337
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
Some money coming in

338
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
Right right

339
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,055
Don't forget to forget that

340
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
Oh that looks yummy

341
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,175
Great and I want to eat one of your French fries thank you so much

342
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Beautiful

343
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:38,975
We really wanted financial support to make our mission-based journalism possible and we really wanted honesty from Egypt

344
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Weather

345
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
Right now we have the ladder

346
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,727

00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,159
It is a creation of Sonic trash

359
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,231
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

360
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,815
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

361
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
To make them more human

362
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,703
Turn the living room lights on

363
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Okay

364
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,055
Dim the living room lights to 50%

365
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
Okay

366
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:05,247
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

367
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,551
Makes for a much more natural

368
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
Experience

369
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,111
Turn the living room lights on

370
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
Dim the living room lights

371
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
50%

372
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,887
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

373
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,703
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

374
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,263
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

375
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

376

00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
E9pay

378
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,735
We need to talk about something

379
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:43,135
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating it's not that bad you take laxatives

380
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Routine

381
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
Thinking about it all the time is frustrating

382
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:52,351
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

383
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:58,751
Then it may be time to seek help go to oh my God. Info podcast we can learn more

00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
Oh my God

386
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
Flask podcast

387
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,135
You probably her to say that we are proud members of radiotopia at the end of the first three episodes

388
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,232
Some might say that we have rapper POs to thank

389
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:23,072
For our entree into that awesome podcasting Collective

390
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,400
Last year he put out a song called wearing a bear

391
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,448
He gave shout-outs to me

392
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:34,848
Radiotopia co-founder Roman Mars

393
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:41,248
Cup holder

394
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:47,648
But the passengers ice-cold pushing down the pressure when a guy I'll guess tags

395
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,672
Get better

396
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:53,024
Now Jen and I were the newest members of radiotopia

397
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,840
And that meant we owned all our work

398
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,424
I had hung out with Roman before but he and Jen had never met

399
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,472
And when he suggested that we come out

400
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
Spend the day with him

401
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
We were both sick

402
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
Ira Glass

403
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
Jad album Rod

404
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
Roman Mars

405
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,712
These are the great names and narrative audio storytelling

406
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,272
So it's kind of like going to Kiss the Ring

407
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,624
Accept all of them or public radio nerdy cool so

408
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Enter code

409
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Play Store

410
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,512
Same weight that morning

411
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
Jen and I were most

412
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584
Definitely not

413
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,704
Just getting into the building seemed to be a struggle for us

414
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:39,872
Roman Mars to know which one he's on

415
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
So sorry

416
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,736
That conversation with jazz must have rattled us more than we knew

417
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:49,088
Start

418
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
Okay let's try no

419
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
Here we go

420
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
Wow that's nice

421
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
Hainan

422
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,248
Enchanted

423
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,648
It's so nice to meet you

424
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,672
Did we have like

425
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,232
24 hours

426
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
When did you arrive

427
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
Yesterday

428
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
And then we had like an epiphany last night

429
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,656
But we need your help cuz

430
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
Over already

431
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,640
Public radio producer making shows barely making any money

432
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:51,040
When podcasting started taking off about 5 or 6 years ago he went to PRX and they decided to Jess Conte

433
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:55,648
Concentrate on that form a collective where the podcasters owns their work

434
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,720
It's stop worrying about making radio shows

435
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,768
Make a business out of podcasting

436
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
Or at least a decent living

437
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,608
Still doing great Public Radio

438
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Alcantara

439
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,032
Roman and radiotopia had done one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns in the history of Kickstarter

440
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:16,896
I am Roman Mars I am the host of night

441
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,480
And I am the co-founder of radiotopia from PRX

442
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:25,600
And we're sitting in your office downtown Oakland California

443
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,416
Romina definitely taking some big Financial Risk

444
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
In his time

445
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,024
I mean it's just like it's a business like any other so you make enough money to

446
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
Pea salary odoo

447
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
And then you see

448
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
Can you make enough money to

449
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:41,472
Add another person that another person then you make enough money to have money left over to

450
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
You reap the benefits of ammonia

451
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,080
And it took me

452
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,128
Bi4

453
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,664
Almost 8 years

454
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
And

455
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,760
The way it operated in the beginning was that

456
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
I didn't

457
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
Pay myself

458
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,112
I mean were there moments where you were like

459
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,416
What is it

460
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,512
I just feel like you can always get a job

461
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,328
So what does failure mean in this case

462
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,144
Tele means you do with the thing that everyone else does

463
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,704
That's not really failure right right

464
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
It's true

465
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
It's like

466
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
I don't know I didn't

467
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,872
I feel more scared of it now

468
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
And I did then

469
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,200
Yeah because

470
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
Can employees

471
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,832
Opiate self like

472
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:34,720
A lot of the revenue that operates radiotopia is the percentage of my show because my show brings in a lot of AD Revenue

473
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
Until like

474
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
Now I feel like

475
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
Timeout

476
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Keep hustling

477
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
It's like different

478
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:47,520
We've been struggling to decide how to fully fund the show

479
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:53,664
Did they decide I suppose we've been talking about whether we should seek out investment or get grants or

480
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:00,064
Yes make the thing and then get the sponsorship that way you should do all of it

481
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
Right away

482
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,648
Radiotopia fundraising

483
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:09,024
Because we have a model which supports shows that can support themselves completely as Advertising based

484
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
We

485
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,632
We really need donations to support

486
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
Asleep at the hole

487
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,704
Slate of shows

488
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,032
And then we then we have to do that to me is like

489
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,056
That's how we make art

490
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
Like rather than Chase Commerce

491
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
What you just said

492
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,712
Art rather than Commerce

493
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Kind of

494
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,016
Thumbs up

495
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,296
The

496
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,624
Soul searching that you and I have been doing Jen

497
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:40,512
So the question that we keep getting is what do you want it depends what you want what do you want what do you want

498
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,168
I think we're getting closer to knowing what we were

499
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,472
Well I think it's because the news

500
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,384
We starting to succeed in these ways where she was being asked to speak she's doing the Ted talk so we could naturally see a model

501
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,200
That would work that was bigger than just a show

502
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
We are

503
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:04,576
About to document this experience both of making the show making this business

504
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,648
All the different choices that were just talking about right

505
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,256
And it feels very vulnerable to admit all this on tape

506
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:16,608
Yeah I can see that I'm glad I wasn't talking to you my friend

507
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
Publicly is to women to do it

508
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,984
But you also I get that

509
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
Can I get that that's a risk

510
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,592
We also you're going to get a lot of strength from that too

511
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:31,200
Again it's like this balance of risk and reward and you have a greater risk

512
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:35,808
Can we bake and also it's just like

513
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,088
I fully believe

514
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
That

515
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
Your uncle

516
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,464
In life is to live an extraordinary

517
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,512
Like live a weird life

518
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,352
I think that's true I think there's that there are a lot of women out there

519
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
That need to

520
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
To hear other women doing this

521
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
You don't

522
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,520
We've asked for a lot of advice from a lot of people and every

523
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,872
Bit of advice when it comes to business seems to be like well the way of business works like

524
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:06,016
You're not going to be able to do this like a lot of people kind of say like it's not going to work

525
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:09,600
It depends on what type of business you have or one

526
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,904
I totally I think

527
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
You know like

528
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,536
Videos of bad startup in a good business

529
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
Because it doesn't

530
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:26,752
Return money the way they wanted to and if you do you have to grow and make things that you don't care about

531
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
But

532
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,336
He just want to make a show and pay yourself

533
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,616
You can do that

534
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,408
That is not that Steep Hill to climb

535
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
You could do that

536
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,992
And then from there you begin to go

537
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576
I think that you follow your gut when it comes to that.

538
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,184
And personally I think that there's no money without strings attached the only money I've ever

539
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
It has strings attached. I like

540
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,768
Is money from the audience

541
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
I guess I'm going to be very

542
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,472
Business and fraternal or something

543
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,496
How much you got saved

544
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,544
Do you have a year saved

545
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
Can you live without making any money

546
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,640
I definitely cannot

547
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
I like 2 months baby laugh

548
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
So

549
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:16,160
Is that asymmetry in your needs does that cause attention in your choices

550
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:24,096
I would say that at the beginning where I was like well if I'm going to invest in the company I want to own more of it and gents it now

551
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,520
I worried it like you're putting in different sacs

552
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,872
I mean if a company can never pay me back that's

553
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,712
Tell me something

554
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,528
That's what I kind of think I'm really

555
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,064
Money is freedom

556
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
That's what it's for

557
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,392
The hard part of ownership is that the

558
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
The runway

559
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,976
SB kind of long

560
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,792
Yes for you gets the points sustainable

561
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,608
And if the runway is short then

562
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
It actually

563
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,680
It f**** with the sustainability

564
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,984
I think we're trying to figure out

565
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,360
What's a minimum we can pull in through all these various funding

566
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,944
Sources if we're not going to do the BC thing and still

567
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,480
Sustain ourselves

568
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,576
Until that Runway gets long enough for it to become really sick

569
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,136
I mean it's something you have to be prepared

570
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
2

571
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
Recognizance.

572
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
Working

573
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
I just think things like what

574
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,632
Is it it's kind of easy if you don't have a lot of other pressures

575
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,960
To hold onto something that you maybe shouldn't be holding on to

576
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,776
What would make you sun set this whole thing

577
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,640
It's a really good question

578
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,968
But you know it's that is so hard to answer cuz if you had

579
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,272
Ask me that about note to self I wouldn't have

580
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,832
Shit happens and you have no idea

581
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Set this whole

582
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
Is it a better opportunity

583
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,096
It's like no cuz this is

584
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,144
This is the best

585
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
But let me ask you this

586
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,752
Can you just make 99 Pi forever like

587
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
Well I wonder that too

588
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
I've given myself

589
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,920
A kind of a timeline

590
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,272
Of I need to make it as successful as possible

591
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,320
43 now

592
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,696
I don't know if the end of it's going to happen when I'm 50

593
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,792
I think I would probably go your route faster like right now

594
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
Weird

595
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,656
People are doing projects inside of

596
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,704
Rainbow

597
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,496
Which will be new things for the word

598
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,312
And I can't really talk about him but we could say this much

599
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,384
I could imagine

600
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,920
That my life

601
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
Is

602
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,224
Not

603
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
Hosting

604
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
Yashow

605
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
Running Shop

606
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,832
And also it's just like

607
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
I

608
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,416
Feel myself more tired

609
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
Can I ever have

610
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
I just can't

611
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,048
I can't work this hard

612
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
Forever

613
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:18,688
Roman thank you so much

614
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,480
You guys are taking action

615
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:26,112
I don't know but it's a good chance like it's like that's the thing it's like it's more you were that's why raise up your work

616
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,648
It's like

617
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,672
I don't own it

618
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,952
And we don't own it

619
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:36,608
It's your chance to take we just get to be part of it and we'd like to be a part of things that we're proud of

620
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:42,496
Our session with Roman kind of felt like a motivational pep talk

621
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,592
We don't have to stand on chairs and yell like a Tony Robbins event

622
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,896
Dyspeptic was way more chill

623
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
Thank you and welcome

624
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,248
My pleasure I'm so happy you're here

625
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,552
This conversation was just what we need

626
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,856
Jen and I were resolved

627
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
Investment money

628
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
For now

629
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,440
Was not for us

630
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
Another

631
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
Enemies Act

632
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,352
That we needed to focus on making the podcast

633
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
This podcast

634
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,424
Stick to the mission

635
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,472
And then if we made it that far

636
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,496
Weed reassess

637
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,128
So we went back to New York and even put a big red circle around one summer day on the calendar

638
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,408
We labeled it

639
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
Financial Reckoning day

640
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:29,600
But it felt good to know we have the support of not just one

641
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,136
But to Collective

642
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,440
Roman and radiotopia

643
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,976
Kauai Distributing this show

644
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256
And selling sponsorship

645
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
Uncivil

646
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,840
Experiment using the blockchain

647
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,168
To create a new ecosystem for independent journalists

648
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,472
True the whole thing with Stacy

649
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,544
But they had given us just enough money to pay the bills

650
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,104
Maybe the token thing would actually work

651
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,640
Anyway

652
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,176
The Civil people

653
00:33:54,432 --> 00:34:00,576

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

660
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,552
Series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

661
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,344
The body genius is a dark

662
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,368
Comic mystery

663
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,696
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

664
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
We're looking the part

665
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,768
Might cost you your life

666
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,144
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

667
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,496
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

668
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,824
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

669
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,848
A dad

670
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:59,200
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

671
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
Actually if I'm being honest

672
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,552
I'm one of the main got to know how to do that guy

673
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:09,952
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an act

674
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,232
Movie called Immortal cop

675
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,560
Was found dead in my private gym

676
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,960
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had some

677
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,264
Nothing to do with it now

678
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,312
I need to clear my name

679
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:31,712
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

680
