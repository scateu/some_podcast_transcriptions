The fundamental ethical precepts of medicine is that doctors

First Do no harm

54
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,792
A number of Architects have taken a stance that there are some buildings that just should not have been built

55
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
And they don't just mean the ugly

00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,216
They violate standards of Human Rights Greenspan

58
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
He's talking about prison

59
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,872
Specifically prisons that keep inmates alone in cells with little to do

60
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
Minimal human contact

61
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
Inmates have names for these places

62
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
The Box

63
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
Work the Bing

00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,320
On the outside we know them as supermax

65
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
Or

66
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
The shoe

67
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,928
That's Shu for security housing unit

68
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,024
Now it's Up For Debate as to whether or not the shoe is solitary confinement

69
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,864
Recent being and this is something weird we found while researching the story

70
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,960
There is no legal definition for solitary confinement

71
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,288
The UN doesn't have one to Department of Justice doesn't have one

72
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,336
And neither does the cdcr

73
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,152
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation

74
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064
Cdcr maintains that no prisoners in California are kept in solitary confinement

75
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
Has a quote

76
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
Segregation unit

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
But a number of groups

78
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
Including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch

79
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
Do call the shoe solitary confinement

80
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,400
And there's a lot of controversy surrounding one shoe at a northern California prison

81
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
Call Pelican Bay

82
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:56,800
Pelican Bay State Prison was designed by San francisco-based Architecture Firm KMD

83
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,872
Candy declined to speak to us for this story

84
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,456
But Jim Miller and architect we can do you work on Pelican Bay

85
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
Did talk with architect magazine about prison

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
He said

87
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Quote

88
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,720
The inmates have no contact with other inmates during the vast majority if not all of the day

89
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,375
They are only allowed out of their cells for very short periods of time for constitutionally required exercise.

90
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
Life inside of a shoe

91
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,263
Is 22 to 23 hours a day

92
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
80 or so square feet

93
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:37,247
Nancy Molina radio reporter with life of the law managed to get access to the shoe in Pelican Bay State Prison in

94
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
California

95
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,087
She went inside one of the cells and had an inmate Robert Luke

96
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
Describe the room

97
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
Basically

98
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,279
The cell I don't know what size 6 by 9 or 6 by 12 whatever it is

99
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
That

100
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,887
Your bunk is your living room the center of it

101
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
You're walking area and

102
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,263
Two steps to the right is your

103
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
Bathroom

104
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,383
The official measurements are actually 7 and 1/2 by 12

105
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
It's not a space

106
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
That's designed to keep you

107
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,575
But it's not these architectural features that concern humanitarian activist

108
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Stan psychiatry

109
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,439
It's the amount of time many prisoners spend in that cell

110
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,255
Without any meaningful activity

111
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,351
Long-term solitary confinement which is

112
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,935
Either for months or years or it goes on forever

113
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
As a Pelican Bay

114
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,871
Connected with absolute idleness that is the individual socially isolated to the extreme

115
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
But also has nothing meaningful to do

116
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:42,527
And this causes human breakdown this destroys people as human beings

117
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
Terry Cooper's is a psychiatrist

118
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
Who specializes in forensic

119
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,207
That is he's an expert on the intersection of Mental Health

120
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
In criminal justice

121
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,607
He served as an expert witness on more than 20 class action lawsuits concerning prison conditions

122
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,167
He says there's a whole Litany of the facts

123
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
It's solitary can have on a purse

124
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:07,359
Massive free floating anxiety paranoid ideas tomney depression and suicidal

125
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,919
Thoughts of reprimanded their eyes are destroyed

126
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
Because if you do not look

127
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
At a distance

128
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
Prolong lengthen

129
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
Time your eye deteriorate

130
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,207
They have concentration and memory problems and I ask if they re

131
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,303
And they'll say no because I can't remember what I read three pages earlier

132
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
Mounting anger

133
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:34,239
And they almost universally report that they're terrified that their anger will get out of control they'll be in Mortar

134
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,287
Trouble in the novel longer-term

135
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
In solitaire

136
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,127
And that's just for a normal stable person

137
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,479
Four prisoners with a history of or predisposition to mental illness

138
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
Solitary can bring on a break

139
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:51,391
Now again there is no universally accepted definition of solitary confinement

140
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:56,511
And like the law reporter Nancy MacLean it says that compared to other prisons she has visited

141
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,351
There are actually some good design elements in the Pelican Bay shu

142
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
Inmates can get natural light from skylights outside of their cells

143
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,007
What's drifts into the doors made of perforated metal

144
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,079
These Forest doors allow for inmates to communicate with

145
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,383
Each other even though there are no lines of sight

146
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
To any prisoner from within the cell

147
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
But on the other hand cells don't have Windows

148
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,807
Inmates never get to see the horizon

149
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,647
The only time prisoners get to leave the cell is to visit the shower

150
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
Or the exercise.

151
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,255
And the exercise yard is an empty windowless room

152
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
Not much bigger than a cell

153
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,095
20 foot high concrete walls

154
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,911
Animal many prisoners in the shoe have a cellmate

155
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
Terry Cooper

156
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,775
Says sharing a cell is often worse than being alone

157
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,359
So if that's not solitary confinement per se

158
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
You could call it a kind of

159
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
Binary

160
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
And all of this taken together

161
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
Some people call torture

162
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,623
In 2011 Juan Mendez the UN special rapporteur on torture

163
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,927
Said anything over 15 days

164
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,511
15 days in solitary confinement is a human rights abuse

165
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,095
Not various other commentators have said that means it's torture

166
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,143
15 days says the UN

167
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,239
Is the point at which people in solitary can begin to have a reputable

168
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Psychological.

169
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,383
I don't actually like the 15-day standard some people fall apart in two days

170
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
And what Terry Cooper's calls torture

171
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:23,551
Happens in buildings specifically designed to maximize the isolation or

172
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
Quote unquote segregation

173
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,671
Of prisoners for the duration of their time in the shoe

174
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,975
So if it is the ethical code of Ark text

175
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
Promote human rights

176
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,095
What is their responsibility to the people who are incarcerated

177
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
And they're building

178
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,215
Did Argentina the military regime torture people in a former Auto Body

179
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
That was one of their big torture

180
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
I'm not going

181
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:48,383
Nobody's going to say that the architecture design the auto body shop or somehow responsible

182
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,943
Are you at the car mechanics we just own it or no

183
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
This is Raphael Sperry but

184
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
When

185
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
Solitary confinement

186
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,647
I practice that requires a certain kind of space and when your

187
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,231
Specifying the space exactly for that and making sure

188
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,839
And all the doors can be operated without you know seeing another human being that the outdoor space

189
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,399
This is going to be one that occupied by one person at a time

190
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
There's nowhere

191
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
What group of people tax

192
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
Be together

193
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
What happened

194
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
Then that is

195
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
It's the design at 10

196
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
When used as intended

197
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
Human rights violations will result

198
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,711
Raphael Sperry is an architect here in San Francisco

199
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:29,855
And he's the president of a group called a DPS are Architects designers and planners for social responsibility

200
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,207
A few years back Raphael have been following the news from Guantanamo Bay

201
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,023
And reading up on mass incarceration in the US

202
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,071
Not necessarily as an architect

203
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,143
Per se just as a civic-minded social justice oriented

204
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
Kind of guy

205
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,031
And then one day in 2010 he saw an article in the San Francisco Chronicle

206
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
About the we design

207
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,359
San Quentin prison in California

208
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:56,991
So yeah the chronicle actually ran a picture that was supplied by the Corrections Department that was the cad model

209
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783
A kind of three-dimensional floor plan

210
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
The execution chamber

211
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Suite of rooms

212
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Sounds like

213
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
They're using the same tools

214
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
That I use

215
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
To make

216
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,303
Residential additions for people to make schools

217
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
Only this product is going to kill people

218
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
That was totally

219
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,543
Seen the remodel of the death chamber was the catalyzing event but you could argue that there's a difference between designing a death room and does

220
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
Designing a shoe

221
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:27,199
But Sperry views both as a moral and in violation of the human rights that architect

222
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
Swear to uphold

223
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
Raphael Sperry wants architect

224
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,855
Extend the profession of architecture as a whole at least in the US

225
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,951
To stop building shoes or any structures that are designed

226
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,743
For long-term solitary

227
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Confinement

228
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
Or are designed to put

229
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
People to death

230
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,471
He's not talking about all prisons or jails just the ones were isolation is baked into the physical structure

231
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
Like the AIA architect design shoe

232
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
At Pelican Bay prison

233
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Pelican Bay State Prison is

234
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,663
Way up in Northern California near the Oregon border

235
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Hours

236
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Any major city

237
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
It opened in 1989

238
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,063
The house the so-called worst of the worst

239
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
Suspected gang members

240
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
And people who are seen to pose the greatest threat

241
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
The officers

242
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Another inmate

243
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,559
It was modeled after prison in Arizona and has since inspired design

244
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,351
Other prisons across the country

245
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
Even buildings in Guantanamo Bay

246
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,287
Life the laws Nancy MacLean head corrections officer lieutenant

247
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:29,151
Graves described his take on the purpose of the shoe when she visited Pelican Bay

248
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
In 2012

249
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
The key to making this design work

250
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
In our favor

251
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
Is it is not just

252
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
The design of it

253
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
But how it's managed

254
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,255
And historically Pelican Bay is is done a very good job of managing

255
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,583
The worst of the worst in the state

256
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
This

257
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
Prison was designed and built

258
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
To manage

259
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,703
5% of the California

260
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
Prison population

261
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,823
Those were the 5% that were causing the majority of crimes

262
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
In the other prison

263
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Throughout the state

264
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:06,527
Pelican Bay or any prisoners mayonnaise is the determining factor in what life is like

265
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
For prisoners

266
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,623
The way these prisons are used isn't the only way there

267
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
It could be you

268
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
Prison management could decide that Shu prisoners

269
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:20,351
Could be allowed to go outside of the building and secure gated area or the exercise yard could be repurposed as a communal.

270
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,935
We're just making these up as far as I know these have never been considered

271
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
Sperry

272
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,287
The key here is design intent

273
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,103
Pelican Bay is managed the way it is

274
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,431
And prisoners day-in-day-out are the way they are

275
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
Cuz that's how architects

276
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
Imagine the place to work

277
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
During the design process

278
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
Insperity along with the ADP Sr

279
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
Architects designers and planners

280
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Social responsibility

281
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,047
Say it's time to stop building the prisons that are designed

282
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
For what he see that solitary confinement

283
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
Or any other kind of torture or exit

284
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
It would seem like the least that architects

285
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
To do with that to demonstrate our commitment to public health safety and well-being is to say when you enter one of our bills

286
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
It's not intended

287
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
The kill you

288
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,111
Which brings us back to the rather minimal statement in the AIA code of ethics and professional condo

289
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
Ethical standard 1.4

290
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
Member should uphold human rights

291
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
In all their professional endeavors

292
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
That's it

293
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
Human rights

294
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
Refers to the international

295
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,167
That is built up around the United Nation

296
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
And strongly supported by these ads

297
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,031
Like Amnesty International and human rights

298
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:36,383
Human rights is not a term that United States courts use and it's not a term in the US.

299
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
Black Sea refers to something even bigger than

300
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
Bayside membership

301
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Support the US

302
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:47,391
Sperry and the ADP Sor are petitioning the AA to adopt a new Claws and its ethics

303
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Quotes

304
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,487
Members shall not design spaces intended for

305
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Iqushion

306
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,607
Word for torture or other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment

307
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
Including prolonged solitary confinement

308
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,775
And so if you happen to find yourself in prison you should know that because your prison was designed by architect

309
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
You won't be subjected

310
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,335
Cruel inhuman kratom

311
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,871
Punishment for that killed their

312
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,735
So far the San Francisco chapter of the AIA has recommended The Proposal

313
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,855
Which point out here that the AIA San Francisco was instrumental in the creation of 99% invisible

314
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,183
But it doesn't give us any money or servant in the editorial function

315
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,535
Is the NAIA National adopt this amendment

316
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
It will become part of the ethics

317
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,119
Code for all AIA Ark

318
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
Virtually every practicing Arkansas

319
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
In the United States

320
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,287
Regardless of how you feel about prisons

321
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
Rehabilitate people or weather

322
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
We should lock him up

323
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
Throw away the key

324
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
It's important to keep in mind

325
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
But these attitudes change over time

326
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
From the 1890s to the 19th

327
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,391
The US had a really different take on Prison

328
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,231
The emphasis was on curing or rehabilitating

329
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
People from a life of crime

330
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,375
Granted there were some really terrible things that happened in prisons during that time

331
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
But the emphasis Italy

332
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,495
Was on getting prisoners to become productive members of

333
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Society again

334
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,335
A big shift happened with the War on Drugs

335
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,383
Which a lot more people to jail

336
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,711
And then there was the violence of the prison riots or uprising

337
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
What happened to the 1970

338
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,319
So from the point of view of prison officials

339
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,879
Who are in charge of jailing these populations

340
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,439
Blocking people up in their cells most the time

341
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
Started looking like a good Ops

342
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Hence

343
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
Miss you

344
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
But when you create a building with a very

345
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
Stream design intent

346
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
Little variability

347
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,007
You're locking prisoners into that current mindset for the lifespan of the prison

348
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,591
Tamms Correctional Center a supermax prison in Illinois

349
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,663
Closing early 2013 to make up for

350
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
A state budget for

351
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,807
It turns out how Tina shoot prisoner is nearly twice as expensive as housing

352
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
Eternal popular

353
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Inmate

354
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,415
Widespread budgetary pressure and

355
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,743
Possibly the influence of anti solitary confinement activist

356
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:05,631
Is also causing state governments to reduce the number of supermax prisoners in Mississippi

357
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
Main and Colorado

358
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,519
Raphael Sperry may find he has a strange and Powerful Ally in this fight.

359
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Stop barking

360
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Text building Superman

361
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Prisons

362
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
And that is

363
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Broke

364
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
State government

365
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,015
