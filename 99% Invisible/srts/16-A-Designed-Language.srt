Let me start with this

37
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,648
The invented language of Esperanto has a flag

38
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
And it kicks ass

I'm feeling bored

42
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,400
Because of the design of the flag alone

43
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
Seriously

44
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,472
I could March in the streets behind that flag

45
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,032
But that's not the Esperanto way at all

46
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
Esperanto

Germans in Russia

53
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,952
And they all spoke different languages and they all hated each I

54
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
So he had this

55
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,024
Idea that if everybody's

56
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
Common language they

57
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584

58
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120

59
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,424

7 Hospital dream of peace to a shared second language never came to pass

71
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,960
According to estimates somewhere between 50000 and 2000000 people speak Esperanto

72
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
But that shouldn't

73
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800

Esperanto with a real product of the time

80
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,536
Early 20th century when nationalism was

81
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
Tearing Europe apart

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,984
All these old Empires were crumbling and the lines around which they fractured where linguistic ones

83
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,336
Tell me a lot of sense to say hey let's find a linguistic solution to our problem

84
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,968
The mantle of Esperanto as the king of invented languages also had to do with its design

85
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,296
As a language Esperanto was designed to

86
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Have

87
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
As simple as

88
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:15,232
Possible a grammar all nouns end in o all adjectives end in a

89
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:21,631
Verb tenses indicated by regular endings and it never varies so there are no irregular verb

90
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,959
She learn a finite number of endings in a few root words

91
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
And you're up and running

92
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
After a few weeks

93
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
Woodstock commune

94
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
But it's other strength is that it's not

95
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
To engineer

96
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
Being over design is up

97
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
Fall of many other invented languages

98
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
Previous project

99
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,439
Tried to be so consistent and regular ants

100
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,487
Breakdown the entire world of

101
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,047
Concepts into their component pieces

102
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
Which letter would contain a part of meaning within it

103
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,423
Those hundred languages are impossible to use

104
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
Esperanto has nice

105
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,103
Floppy Middle Ground if it's a nice balance between system atticity and arbitrary sloppiness

106
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,919
And when it comes to language we need both

107
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,759
Of those things in our natural languages we need a way to get

108
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
Pacific Rim we need to with a we have

109
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903
Stuff like legal jargon but it also lets us just sort of

110
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
Talk without

111
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,535
Necessarily knowing where we're going with it or no

112
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
Exactly what we mean

113
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
So Froyo language Adventures out there don't make it

114
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Too Perfect

115
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
A little

116
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
Fuzziness is key

117
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
So is artistic

118
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,615
Expression from the beginning xiamen hofstrasse poetry and music

119
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Esperanto

120
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,687
And there are unique aspect to the language

121
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,479
That make it especially Suited

122
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
To a kind of poetic word

123
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,623
With endings you can make any word into a verb so if you

124
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
You have blue eye meaning

125
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
Blue you can also have a verb

126
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Blue eyes

127
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
Is bluing soap and Esperanto

128
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,815
Conseil not yellow

129
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,351
Estas blue eyes

130
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
Sky is blue

131
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,191
But nothing really wants to be in Sp

132
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
Save-A-Lot yellow

133
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
Blue waffle

134
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
The sky is Bluing

135
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
And that's a very

136
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
Esperanto way of expressing it

137
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
Anywhere can also be an adverb

138
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
Which is strange not many languages

139
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Pandas

140
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
So you don't say

141
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
I go to the beach in the summer

142
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
USA

143
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
Summerly

144
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
I go to the beach

145
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
Some early I go to the

146
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
The beach

147
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,303
If you do not approve of that sentence

148
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
I don't want

149
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
How to live in your dark and joyless

150
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Little world

151
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,751
What are the ultimate irony is of Esperanto is that

152
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,567
One of its most widespread uses in the US

153
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
Was during the Cold War

154
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
The US would do these war game

155
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Against

156
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Fictitious

157
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
Anime the maneuver enemy

158
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
Also known as the aggressor

159
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
And they'd have to have the enemies

160
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
Speaking a different language

161
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
And since they didn't want to ask

162
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:56,255
Send any other country they couldn't have them speaking Spanish or French

163
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
Russian even

164
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
They had them speaking

165
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
Esperanto

166
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
Esperanza was used by the US Army so it wouldn't possibly offend another country and cause some unnecessary,

167
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
So even in this

168
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,151
Think we American completely Twisted context

169
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
Esperanto achieved

170
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967

00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
The body genius is a dark

Comic mystery

Might cost you your life

185
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:08,447
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

186
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,799
