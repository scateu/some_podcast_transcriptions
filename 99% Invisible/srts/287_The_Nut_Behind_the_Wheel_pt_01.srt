This turned out to be just a fender bender

Always exist

77
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,800
In fact at first automakers tried to

78
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
Keep data about car wrecks themselves

79
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:05,248
They not only resisted making cars safer they argued the very idea of a safe car

80
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
Was impossible

81
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,368
Story starts in the early 20th century

82
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
Car ads didn't talk about their safety fee

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
They talked about

84
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232

Saying that quote

92
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
They have to have special attractiveness

00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087

00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,903
When safety was discussed

96
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,695
It wasn't about the car

97
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
It was about the driver

98
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,071

00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,615
But all those deaths were blamed on the quote

Another words cars don't kill people

107

People kill people

108
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,951
The whole notion that the machine could have some sort of impact

109
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,999
On the likelihood of you

110
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
Surviving a car crash

111
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
Wasn't even on the radar

112
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
During the first half of the

113
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
The 20th century

114
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423

Historian who studies Auto Safety

116
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Safety-wise how would you

117
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Characterize the cars

118
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Compare them to the

119
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
Large part they were deaf

00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Traps

121
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:43,807
Get seatbelts and airbags the first cars had windshields made out of regular old plate glass

122
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
If your head went through it

123
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
You could get stuck

124
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Wood shards

125
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
Glass pressing into your neck

126
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,255
But before someone could come up with a safer car

127
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,327
Someone had to come up with the idea that cars could be safer

128
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,167
Getting off traces bad idea to a self-taught scientist

Computer Haven

00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
You tell me

131
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:06,079
Alex of the Haven being interviewed

132
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,663
The project really started in 1917 and 18

133
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
When I was just fine

134
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,783
That's the Canadian Air Force in World War 1

135
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
When he was just like

136
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
24 hours away from being commissioned

137
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
He had a horrific plane

138
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Accident

139
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
I ruptured my liver

140
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
I left my conscience

141
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
I rupture my gallbladder

142
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:37,567
While he was in the hospital he had his kind of moment of his epiphany

143
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,247
He concluded that there was a sharp knob on his safety

144
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,063
The belt that I'd probably led to his injury

145
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,671
Until we started thinking that perhaps we can package human beings

146
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Better

147
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
Not just an airplane

148
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
But also in car

149
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,143
The Haven started by crash testing objects dropping eggs onto padding

150
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
From higher and higher Heights

151
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:10,079
He found an egg could survive a 100-foot fall if it landed on a 3 inch thick rubber mat

152
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
Benny turn to human beings

153
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,967
Tracking down the people behind actual newspaper headlines like

154
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,039
Girl falls 10 stories lives and tells a bit

155
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,367
Any marines that we are just like eggs

156
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,207
We can survive seemingly unsurvivable collisions if

157
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
The impact of spread out

158
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
Tell her time and space

159
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
Like when you fall into soft dirt

160
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,655
Or get thrown into a seatbelt instead of the windshield

161
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:41,567
Finally he turned to what was actually happening to people's bodies in the most prolific source of high-speed collisions

162
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Cars

163
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Do that

164
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
He called up hospitals

165
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
Corners and police officer

166
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
Most of whom

167
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,015
Thought he was nuts

168
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
Why was it supposed to be

169
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
The crazy

170
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,415
Well

171
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
Is a very

172
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
People

173
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
In those days

174
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Feel

175
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
If you get in a crash

176
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
You're going to get

177
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
When your not hurt

178
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
What they called a Jesus fact

179
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,503
The Havens crazy theory was that would happen to people's bodies in a car crash

180
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
Was not just luck

181
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,599
It wasn't something you couldn't calculate or change

182
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,671
It was a predictable product of the car's design

183
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,255
It seems so common sense now it's hard to even register it

184
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
What is the time

185
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
It was revolutionary

186
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,655
And in the 40s and 50s to Havenwood prove it was true

187
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:45,055
In 1953 he partnered with the Indiana State Police for a year-long stay

188
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
Their photos and

189
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:53,503
Reports from doctors in Corners able to isolate which parts of the car where the most dangerous in a crash

190
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,063
And there are things that we don't even think of me

191
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,879
Like hard unpadded dashboard send

192
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
Steel knobs with sharp edges

193
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,975
Stuck in people's skulls

194
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
Yeah he's

195
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:09,375
Diagnosing exactly what's causing the injuries inside

196
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
The car

197
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,703
And then what does he find what exactly did he find

198
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Is causing

199
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
Busby's injuries

200
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
The steering column

201
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,871
The steering column itself was not collapsible

202
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:24,479
So if you had a front-end Collision the steering column with push up

203
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
And might even push

204
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
Sprue somebody's chest

205
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,391
Like a spear that might actually impale somebody

206
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:36,255
The solution was the now ubiquitous collapsible steering column

207
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:42,655
A technology that saved 79989 lives as of 2012 according to 1 governor

208
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,983
That's more than anything except the seatbelts

209
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,103
But collapsible steering columns wouldn't become standard equipment in till 1967

210
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,199
More than a decade after results of the Havens Indiana study were published

211
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,295
Because car companies just did not want to deal with his funding

212
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:04,671
Car companies for very paranoid about having a discussion about safety

213
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:11,071
In the 1950s because of discussion about safety was pretty much going to guarantee the people start thinking about the day

214
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
Dangers of driving

215
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:17,215
And it's just not fun to drive when you're thinking about a knob getting embedded in your skull

216
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
Steering column being jammed in your chest

217
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:25,151
I mean one of the things that you to have an is definitely looking directly at is

218
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
Our mortality

219
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:33,599
And it's kind of the analysis of risks in general require us to think about something that a society we

220
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
We rarely if ever want to think about

221
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,463
Better for society to think about it

222
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,279
Would take more than an academic research

223
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
It would take politics

224
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
I want to have my name so you remember where I am

225
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
This is Joan Claybrook

226
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,823
Joan Claybrook would eventually be in charge of Auto Safety

227
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
United States

228
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,175
1965 she was a political novice

229
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:03,551
Coming to Washington for the first time as a fellow for the American Political Science Association

230
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,367
And I I signed up to work with a member of Congress

231
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
Atlanta Georgia

232
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
And

233
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
He was concerned about

234
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
Kids in this neighborhood

235
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Man killed

236
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,303
In car crashes and he is very unsafe at any

237
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,447
Speed unsafe at any speed was an unlikely bestseller by a car safety obsessed young lawyer

238
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Name Ralph

239
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,055
Nader latest book and that's the first time that I realized

240
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
The car design was

241
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Crucial

242
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
Can your survive on a car

243
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Crashing

244
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:37,343
The book took research by people like you to Haven and turned it into a scorching indictment of the Ottawa

245
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,439
Mystery issued car companies actually patented safety technology

246
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
Including the collapsible steering column

247
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
I just want using it

248
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,071
I got to know

249
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
Because I was one of the most

250
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,191
Williams audiences play all the things you want to do

251
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
Behind the scenes Joan Claybrook work

252
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,591
With Ralph Nader on a bill to regulate the Auto industry for the first time

253
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,663
Neither would give testimony in front of Congress

254
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,503
It sounded like a grad student reading is overly academic thesis paper

255
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,575
Just for flavor here some from 1960

256
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
87

257
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,135
Mr frenetic activity

258
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
Deserve their corporate employer

259
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
These lawyers

260
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
Became Afflicted with a tunnel vision

261
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
The brings with it

262
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
The Familiar lawyer malady known as

263
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Retainer a stigma

264
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Warren and that sound

265
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
The Auto industry was

266
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
Terrified of Regulation

267
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Andolina

268
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,311
And that's why the Auto industry

269
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
Heritage jumpsuit

270
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Trail near me

271
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
I got some dirt on them in

272
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Try to discredit

273
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,247
This was when the greatest cell phones in American political history

274
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
General Motors didn't get any turn on data

275
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,927
The word got out they were trying to undermine him and it made General Motors

276
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Just

277
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Terrible

278
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,047
And that's what they did and that's what made him a national hero

279
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
I gave a lot of power

280
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,143
In just a few months the car companies

281
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
Had helped energize a movement to regulate

282
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
Car companies

283
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
And that movement

284
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Succeeded

285
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
Distinguished

286
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
Members of the Congress the administration

287
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
Friends

288
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:12,831
On September 9th 1966 President Lyndon Baines Johnson addressed more than 200 guests at

289
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,367
At the White House Rose Garden

290
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,719
Including Ralph Nader and the President of General Motors

291
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:23,327
What they heard was a president talking about cars in the language of Public Health

292
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,423
Are yours now we've tolerated a raging epidemic

293
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
He called it

294
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
Highway disease

295
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,591
A disease that have killed more than three times as many Americans as all our Wars

296
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,639
Despite our technological advances

297
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
We were failing

298
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Secure it

299
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
In this age of space

300
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,783
We're getting plenty of information about how to spend Menen

301
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Space

302
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
And how to bring them home

303
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
Yet we don't know if

304
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Foreshortening

305
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
Baltimore auto accident

306
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Cancer caused by faulty brakes

307
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
Bye-bye soft shoulders

308
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,839
Are by drunk drivers are eaten by the deer crossing the highway

309
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
And with that

310
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,679
LBJ started signing bills

311
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,495
Traffic safety act will ensure safer

312
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
Better protected cars

313
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
In the event

314
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,663
That bill created a new federal agency

315
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,247
What's now the national highway traffic safety administration

316
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
It had the power to make car companies install seat belt

317
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
Collapsible steering column

318
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,927
And to set up those crash database

319
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,583
And in case that wasn't enough this bill to create a powerful government agency to regulate what were then some of the large

320
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
Largest companies in the country

321
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,215
It passed with nearly unanimous bipartisan support

322
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
The 60s

323
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Sprayberry

324
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Different time

325
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Thank you

326
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:49,855
Technologies that were mandated in the 1960s like seat belts and collapsible steering columns are still saving

327
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
Thousands of lives each year

328
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:58,047
But the car crash death rate has continued to drop decade after decade in part because of

329
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
Smaller sudler design changes

330
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,655
And understand how those changes happen

331
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,239
You have to go back to the government databases of car crashes

332
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:11,359
The ones fed by police officers like Frank Bandero and use-by safety engine

333
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
Mike Matt

334
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
Tumblr

335
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,831
Matt brumbelow is an engineer at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety

336
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Poor iihs

337
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,927
Honest SKS bolt a car headlight

338
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,999
And a giant paper book of federal regulations

339
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
Federal Register

340
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
Define pastime

341
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,239
About 10 years ago Matt was looking at that government databases

342
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Fatal crashes

343
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,847
Government-run website

344
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,151
Sifting through the data he noticed something

345
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
People dying in head-on crashes

346
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
In cars that were rated safe

347
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
In head-on crash test

348
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,647
A lot of these crashes had a distinctive look

349
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
The passenger side was okay

350
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:03,071
The driver side look like a giant had destroyed the corner of the car with a croquet mallet

351
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
Pushing the bumper

352
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
Past the engine and the wheels off

353
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
Be there completely off for push

354
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
Way back towards dock

355
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Did it take some

356
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,127
Set a time to recognize or was it like a man

357
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
Fairly immediate

358
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,295
He immediately recognized that this was a kind of crash

359
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
These otherwise safe cars

360
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,647
Hadn't been designed to withstand

361
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
Switch to math

362
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
Was an opportunity

363
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
We can probably do something

364
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Sing about it

365
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,839
Something like designing a new crash test

366
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,679
Test IHS has been doing since 2012

367
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,567
I went one of these crash test for the BMW X1

368
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:50,943
And in the hours before the main event it's kind of how I imagine it would be backstage

369
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,039
Team of people running around making tiny cosmetics

370
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
Tweaked star

371
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,415
Except the star is a compact SUV and instead of hair and makeup

372
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
There are sensors and instruments

373
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,815
And huddled in one corner of the room Engineers from BMW

374
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
Tibbetts Creek

375
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
Make sure you're doing everything right

376
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,423
No they drink always everything

377
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Portrait

378
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Butt watching

379
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Closely

380
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,847
Because BMW has a lot riding on

381
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,431
An earlier model got a marginal rating on this test

382
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
One step below acceptable

383
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,039
So BMW redesigned the car

384
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,855
Always design for the new requirements

385
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
Should have seen your requirement from the IHS

386
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,463
We have to redesign our cause

387
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,023
How car is doing these tests

388
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
S'matter

389
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
2 car buyers

390
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
And so it matters to car makers

391
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,911
These days safety cell

392
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,495
And it justifies an incredibly rigorous technical process

393
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
What are you doing

394
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,407
Seat belt sensor tape so it stays

395
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
The breeze long These Bars

396
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
What's the movement of the

397
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Belt

398
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
This is Tyler Ayres

399
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Dummy

400
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
How many sensors

401
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,207
Right now at least for my dummy is 39 total

402
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
39 total

403
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,559
Tyler measures that crash test dummies position

404
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
Down to the millimeter

405
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,423
266 NE fingerpaints the dummy's face

406
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
Half pink half blue so we can

407
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,495
See where hits the airbag

408
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
Kindergarten

409
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
You're pretty much I said I got a job at the circus

410
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Paint clown face

411
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
Let's walk out of here

412
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,295
When we walk into the echo ecrash Hall

413
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,111
It feels like more than just a test of a car

414
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:40,511
It feels like I'm watching the whole cycle of Auto Safety in action

415
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,071
2

416
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,423
You got the new and improved redesigned X1

417
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,751
And you got this meticulous data-driven evaluation

418
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,847
39 sensors sending out 10000 samples a second

419
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,431
For the 17 seconds it takes to drag the X1

420
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:03,039
To a speed of 40 miles per hour

421
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
Destroying this car

422
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,183
In the hopes that maybe its next incarnation

423
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
Can be even safer

424
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,303
A couple months later the rating would be announced

425
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
The X1 went from marginal

426
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
Too good

427
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
And it was named in iihs

428
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Top safety pick

429
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,823
And this change started with Matt brumbelow the safety engineer

430
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,431
I found a need for a new kind of crash test by going through government crash date

431
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,247
Any terms of doing the work that you do

432
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
How important

433
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
Are these

434
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
Federal databases

435
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
Real world car crash

436
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,791
Yeah there

437
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Real

438
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
Crash data

439
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,887
We're just be guessing

440
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,055
Biersbach the Centers for Disease Control put out a list of the greatest Public Health achievements of the 20th century

441
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
On the list are vaccines

442
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,871
Fluoridated water

443
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
And

444
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
Motor Vehicle Safety

445
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,711
Decade after decade

446
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,503
Cars keep getting safer

447
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,831
Because Regulators activist and the automobile engineers

448
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
Keep looking

449
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
How drivers get hurt

450
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,439
I'm finding more things to improve

451
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,231
It's a never-ending process

452
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
It always begins

453
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
With data

454
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,119
But it is not a universal process

455
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,423
It hasn't happened in all Industries

456
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,263
The odds of dying in a car crash have dropped by 80%

457
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
The 60s

458
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,567
The odds of dying from

459
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
A firearm

460
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
Have actually gone up

461
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
Have you been listening to this

462
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,455
Maybe you've been drawing parallels

463
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
Between cars

464
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
Encon safety

465
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
If so

466
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
You wouldn't be alone

467
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,671
When pundits get together to talk about the latest mass shooting

468
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,255
The hook Virginia Tech Columbine the list grows somebody

469
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
We can bring it up

470
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,399
An interesting analogy and it's actually quite telling legal expert Michael Waldman

471
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
You know we

472
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,727
Affected who could drive

473
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,799
We lifted the drinking age to 21 for

474
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:05,407
Stop eating so people wouldn't drive recklessly we put in airbags we change card design

475
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,687
In other words we changed

476
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
Cars and made them

477
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
Safer and

478
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,063
You know the question is are there ways to do that also

479
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,087
With guns

480
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,184
Other pundits will rightly make the point that cars and guns are very different

481
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,512
What is designed to help a person get from point A to point B

482
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
And the other is specifically designed

483
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
To injure or kill

484
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,680
But people in the public health field that's kind of beside the point

485
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,752
Guns are a major cause of death and injury

486
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,824
And whether or not those deaths and injuries are in

487
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
National

488
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,152
Researchers want to know whether or not their prevent

489
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,224
They want to know if a change in gun design

490
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
Oregon laws about gun ownership

491
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,808
Or some other Technique we haven't even

492
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
Thought of yet

493
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:48,160
Could cut down on the more than 20000 gun suicide

494
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,256
And more than 10000 gun homicides that happened each year

495
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,912
Some experts think the first step could be to treat guns more like ours when it comes to research

496
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
For example

497
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,240
Public Health Professor Stephen Terrace

498
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,568
It's called for creating something that does not currently exist

499
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,432
Comprehensive database of deaths like the fatality analysis reporting system

500
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,272
But for guns with data about the victim and the perpetrator

501
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
Whether they've been drinking details about

502
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:21,440
The device itself we don't have those data with regards to gun deaths

503
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,256
So now even though the number of

504
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,584
Motor vehicle related deaths and gun deaths in the United

505
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,168
Stage are approximately the same every year

506
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,008
We have data for one we don't have data for the other

507
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,080
Starrett used government crash data

508
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,640
Tell look at airbags and child restraint laws

509
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,712
But then he shifted his Focus to guns

510
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,504
And the difference was Stark

511
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,344
Instead of just downloading government data did the gatherers own

512
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,136
Corners and police

513
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,696
Like a gun safety Hugh de Haven

514
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,232
Only 50 years later

515
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
It was hard

516
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
It was expensive

517
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,328
And some information like

518
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,120
Specifics about the guns used

519
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
He just couldn't get

520
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,192
There's been a culture that

521
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Built up

522
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
Around guns

523
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,056
Not collecting

524
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080
Information

525
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,872
Where is the exact opposite

526
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
Has occurred

527
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
With regard to

528
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
Cars

529
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,224
If you had to boil it down

530
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,272
Is there one big thing to point

531
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
2

532
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
That explains

533
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
That difference

534
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
Well yes

535
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
There is one big thing

536
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,280
And one powerful thing 2.2

537
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,120
Referred to as the NRA of the National Rifle

538
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
Association

539
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,496
For every chapter in the history of Auto Safety

540
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
There's an opposite chapter

541
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
In the history of gun safety

542
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,384
Usually written with the help of the NRA

543
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,456
We're Advocates of Auto Safety sued car companies

544
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,808
Advocates of gun rights made it nearly impossible to sue gun makers

545
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,648
Congress created registry of drivers and then made it illegal

546
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,672
Create a registry

547
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:04,352
And for each of the hundreds of millions of dollars that the federal government spends each year on Auto Safety

548
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Siri search

549
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
Gun violence research

550
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
If Penny's

551
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
And Scatter it knows all of this

552
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,568
All the people I talked to he was also the most hope

553
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
Which I found kind of

554
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
Hard to understand

555
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
What lets you still be

556
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
Optimistic

557
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
Looking at all those

558
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,576
You're trying your best and

559
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,624
You're doing a fairly good job

560
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
And making me

561
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,232
Sink into some swamp of despair

562
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
But I'm afraid you're not going to

563
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
Seething

564
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
And that I'm not going to do it

565
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,936
And one of the reasons that I'm not going to do it is because

566
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,240
I understand something about

567
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,312
How Public Health made progress over the century

568
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,432
He points out that it took more than 50 years to really reduce smoking in this country

569
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:55,552
And even though some 27,000 lives are now saved each year by Technologies.

570
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
Like seatbelts and airbags

571
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,928
It took decades to get people to even pay attention to car safe

572
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
Progress in public health

573
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,304
Just takes a really long time

574
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,864
There's hardly any examples

575
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,704
In public health where someone came up with an idea

576
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,104
Everyone rallied around the flag saying that's a wonderful idea let's implement it immediately

577
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,944
That's not how it works instead it's a fight

578
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,344
To collect the data to identify what we can change and finally to make the many small incremental model

579
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Vacations

580
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,208
But eventually save tens of thousands of lives

581
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,544
People tend to think the car itself as a critical factor in keeping them safe on the road but car does not

582
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
This is one piece of the puzzle

583
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,688
The engineering of things people might crash into on the side of the road

584
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:59,552
Play say less obvious but nonetheless critical role in Road Safety to

585
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,600
Are some cool examples of that

586
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,952
After this

587
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:20,544
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

588
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,104
The cluttered World a man-made sound

589
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
If

590
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,736
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

591
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:34,624
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and another hearing.

592
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,416
Technology talk to us

593
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,720
It is a creation of Sonic trash

594
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,536
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

595
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,120
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

596
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
To make them more human

597
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,264
Turn the living room lights on

598
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Okay

599
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
Dim the living room lights

600
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
50%

601
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Okay

602
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,248
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake

603
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,808
Human and adding in some thoughtful sound

604
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,624
Makes for a much more natural experience

605
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
Turn the living room lights on

606
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
Dim the living room lights to 50

607
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
80%

608
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:21,472
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

609
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
Landscape is impacting our health

610
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,568
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

611
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,640
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

612
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
Right here

613
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
NPR

614
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,040
We need to talk about something

615
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,600
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

616
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:44,000
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

617
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:49,632
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

618
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,912
And you don't know why

619
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,216
Then it may be time to seek help

620
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,288
Go to oh my God. Info podcast

621
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:01,408
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

622
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
Oh my God

623
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
Dot and Bo

624
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,064
To engineers and designers have done a lot to make car safer

625
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
And we hear about their work

626
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,672
The public statistics and vehicle advertisements

627
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,720
But there's another less

628
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
Visible Dimension to rotate

629
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
Which involves the

630
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,864
Better Vehicles often crash into

631
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,936
And I'm here with our digital director crackle dead

632
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,472
Let's talk a little bit about that

633
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
Side of the equation

634
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,544
We tend to think of

635
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Post

636
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
And support things like

637
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:34,432
Streetlights and telephone wires and road signs as being robots by Design

638
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
Have to be to stand up to the elements right

639
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,344
But sometimes those same supports actually have to serve a really

640
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
Function

641
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
Which is

642
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,696
At the break in just the right way

643
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,000
And I get hit which helps minimize vehicle

644
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,816
Designed to stand up and be started

645
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,352
But also to get knocked out

646
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
So how does that work

647
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
1

648
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,704
Popular type of solution is called a slip basis

649
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,032
Basically instead of sticking a whole pole into the ground

650
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
Which could do a lot of damage

651
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,896
It's hit workers assemble a pole out of two pieces

652
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,688
First there's a low-post

653
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,968
The top plate that just

654
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
Sticks up slightly above the ground

655
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,552
In another post

656
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,344
Is attached in both of that

657
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
And that

658
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,904
Upper pole is the one that holds the

659
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,232
Exactly most what you see is that upper pool

660
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,560
Any idea is that when a car hits that are proposed

661
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:27,424
It will then break away for the Lord post and cause Wells Fargo vehicle and let starts with I

662
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
Annie's awesome mix fixing a post

663
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,568
A lot easier after Collision because often a new top post can just be

664
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
It's all that happened

665
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,384
The old base that just got left behind

666
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
So the connecting bolts

667
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,224
They snap from the force

668
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,016
Of the car hitting the upper post

669
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
Similar Buck stays intact and that's

670
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
Really

671
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,392
Clever solution texting pretty simple when you think about it

672
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,952
But how did you even learn about

673
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,744
That's because you know you see them

674
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
They eat that's not obvious

675
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,376
Yeah they're they're everywhere and I'll be honest I never noticed them before

676
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,168
And looked at me interested in

677
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
Wrote in about the

678
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:09,920
And then I start again about the lady called my dad who's the physicist answer key with him about them and ask him about the Four Seasons

679
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
Play it how it all worked

680
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:15,808
Really hooked me was this one particular Breakaway sign post that Tom

681
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
Send a photo of

682
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,928
Rather than a pair of flat plates like that first one I described

683
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
Where the upper and lower post

684
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,792
Seedo connect to answer to this plant intersection

685
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
This example

686
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:27,840
Angled

687
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,680
Okay so you show me the picture of this when the plates are angled

688
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
Up

689
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
In the direction of

690
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,288
Travel yes exactly

691
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,568
In this so-called

692
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,360
Incline slip base system

693
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,408
It does something pretty remarkable

694
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,456
So instead of shooting just sideways

695
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
Is like the normal post

696
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
Top of the post actual

697
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:46,784
Please put up

698
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
An out-of-the-way

699
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,856
So the angle plate

700
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,160
Sims 4 broken toes upward rather than just

701
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:56,512
Fast forward video this on our website and it shows a car hitting a signpost

702
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,608
And then the whole time. Is over the car and then lands behind it

703
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,168
At least can work great if you know the kind of

704
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,752
Direction of travel right the directions

705
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,800
Acted so for example along the right-hand side of her

706
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
Right

707
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,176
So they're flat and their angles the basis for individual post but

708
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,224
There are lots of other types to write

709
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,272
Oh yeah there's a lot of really need to re-issue

710
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:23,392
Spike on some roadside sign for example they have liked to post supporting the one on either side

711
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,928
And1 Breakaway post

712
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,024
I'm freaking closer to a lame can flip out of the way while the other post

713
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,560
Actually hold the sign

714
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:37,216
And therefore the vehicle can just pass like most so doesn't even break away to the bottom

715
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:43,616
1/2 kind of collapses exactly

716
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
Peyton Place

717
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,224
And then there's have a bigger version of this on telephone poles

718
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
WeChat hinges all the way up

719
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,808
Top so they can actually break away at the base

720
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,208
And it should have been just crashing on the car they they just kind of swing out of the way and the other post take up the load

721
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,000
Of those lines on either side

722
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,536
So the telephone line

723
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:05,120
Hold up the rest of the telephone pole once the pole is broken away

724
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,544
Whole system down on top of you

725
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Just crush your car

726
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,592
That's amazing

727
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:18,432
Emojis aren't looking for them you start seeing these Breakaway systems just all over the

728
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,504
Send the droids in the mechanisms very there's a lot of difference

729
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
Subtypes butt

730
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,112
Usually if that connection to the ground in one form or another

731
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,720
Kurenai also recently worked on a video with

732
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,512
Kristofferson Fox

733
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,560
Media about improving traffic safety

734
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,376
By removing signed entirely

735
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,704
Urban designers call it a shared space approach

736
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,008
