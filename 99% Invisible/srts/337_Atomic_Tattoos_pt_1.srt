Roman Mars

23
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
Producer Liza Jager recently did something that will become pretty common with the Next Generation

24
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,824
No kids she has to Grandma

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
The shower or tattoo

26
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,968
Can you just describe what the tattoo looks like

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,248
What was the tattoo

28
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:29,856
My grandma is very tiny

29
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,928
I think it's maybe 5/8 of an inch

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,000
And it looks like a little hand mirror

31
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,560
Definitely

32
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
It's a little circle

33
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,680
And then a line going off to the side of it

34
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
And then there's our cross over that line because

35
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,544
My blood type is O+

36
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,360
It's a tiny tattoo of her blood type

37
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,432
And just under her left arm

38
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:59,808
Okay so do you think that you can just walk me through step-by-step the whole process of getting the

39
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Tattoo

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
Well

41
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
It was pretty it was pretty straightforward all of the kids whose parents have to sign the slip

42
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,144
Weren't taken marched out of our classroom

43
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
And down the hall

44
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,496
And yeah this was in school

45
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
This happened in Lake County Indiana

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
It was 1952 and my grandma was 16

47
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,944
And at the first station that you came to the

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
Your finger

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,576
And squeeze a little drop of blood onto a little card

50
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
And

51
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
Determine what your blood type was

52
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
And then you proceeded

53
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
Inside the Library

54
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
Inside the Library Carol discovered a few makeshift privacy Booth setup and inside each booth and in Ministry

55
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,472
Waiting with a tattoo gun ready to draw

56
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
Tiny old Plus

57
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,056
Or a b or a minus

58
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,128
On row upon row of waiting students

59
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,456
And always in the same place on the Torso

60
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504
Just under the left arm

61
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,832
It was sort of like it an inkjet printer they took

62
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Seconds

63
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
That was it

64
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:16,096
My grandmother and the other students said they were part of an experimental program called operation tat

65
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
It was administered by the county

66
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
And symbol

67
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
But also kind of terrifying

68
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
The goal of this

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
Was

70
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
How to make it

71
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,456
Easy to transfuse people who had been injured and who needed a blood transfusion

72
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,760
In case of an atom bomb

73
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:41,184
At the age of 16 Liza's grandmother's body was permanently marked in anticipation

74
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,256
Of a nuclear catastrophe

75
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,120
In 1952 the cold war was in.

76
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
And the government was busy developing civil defense strategy

77
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
Things ordinary citizens can do to help protect the home front

78
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,384
And in this case the thinking was that in the event of a Russian attack

79
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,504
The tattoos would make for quicker transfusions if children were incapacitated or did another blood type

80
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:10,368
They would also have what they were calling a walking blood bank

81
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,536
So instead of having to extract blood from people store it and keep it cool you just have a cohort

82
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Potential donors

83
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
Walking around with their blood types

84
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
Written on their side

85
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
And if you needed

86
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Some

87
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
A Plus store

88
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,543
A B minus or something you would just

89
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
Check all these people and they will see you found what you needed to the person that needs

90
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,503
Did the blood into an immediate transfusion

91
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
That you were just sort of like lift up somebody's Iris

92
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,439
Yeah yeah I've got one here this is what we need

93
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,839
For my grandma getting this tattoo was not a big deal

94
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
But I'm not now

95
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
It was a totally normal day

96
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,079
This was Indiana nobody gets all excited

97
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,223
Student loan you took your turn you went back to class and finished your mathematics or whatever else you were doing that

98
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
The time

99
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,575
What is Trivial is it may have seemed at the time

100
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,159
Carol's tattoo was more than a weird little cold war Oddity

101
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,999
It was one of the smallest and most personal manifestations

102
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
But much larger idea

103
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
That deeply influenced how the United States

104
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
Fought the Cold War

105
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
The concept

106
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
Survivability

107
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
Enough canned food

108
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Shelters

109
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Fearlessness

110
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
And sometimes

111
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Tattoos

112
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,687
The American people would be able to survive an atomic attack

113
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,015
And that it was only logical to prepare for it

114
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
Today if we remember anything about the idea of survivability

115
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
It's probably this

116
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,727
It's the angle

117
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:07,103
Song that goes along with this grainy black-and-white film that was distributed by the federal civil defense Administration

118
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,175
It shows a little hand drawn Turtle decking under his shell

119
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,735
He's teaching kids to hide under their desk

120
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
During the bomb

121
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,575
People make fun of Duck and Cover a lot

122
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:21,951
It's considered the number one example of the kind of cold war-era propaganda

123
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
It seems

124
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
Totally ridiculous now

125
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
Kitschy and absurd

126
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
And sort of

127
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:34,239
Unimaginably naive

128
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:43,711
There a lot of jokes made and I think ridicule of Duck and Cover and even today people joke about it and

129
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,039
So you wouldn't be protected at all it wouldn't make any difference

130
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:51,647
Susan Linde is a historian of science at the University of Pennsylvania who studies the Cold War

131
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:57,279
And she says it when we make fun of the usefulness of a tactic like Duck and Cover

132
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
Thinking it couldn't ever work

133
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,631
We're actually just wrong

134
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
Those films

135
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,471
We're in fact based on the individual

136
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,311
Experiences of persons who had been exposed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki

137
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
In September of 1945

138
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,199
Just one month after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

139
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
US military Center

140
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:21,343
A team of American doctors and geneticist to Japan to interview people who survived the attack

141
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,439
They were looking to understand both the short and long-term effects of radiation

142
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:30,047
That program would eventually be named the atomic bomb casualty Commission

143
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
Or the ABC

144
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
It would also prove to be highly controversial

145
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,239
Because the researchers weren't there to treat the survivors

146
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
They were there to study by

147
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
And only to study them

148
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
And

149
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151
The reason to study the survivors

150
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Was because they

151
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
They were surrogates for future American populations that would be subjected to exactly this kind of her

152
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Urban attack

153
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,183
In a future nuclear war

154
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,023
It was American lives not Japanese they were hoping to say

155
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:06,911
Understand who would survive and who would not want an American city was hit with an atomic bomb

156
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,823
So when the American scientists and Physicians arrived in Hiroshima and Nagasaki what they wanted to

157
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
To do first was to

158
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Track

159
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,431
Down how many survivors there were

160
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
They were looking at lots of thing

161
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
Cancer rates irregular pregnancies

162
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
Heart disease

163
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
Also

164
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Critically

165
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
They asked every Survivor the interview

166
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
Where were you

167
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
At the moment of the detonation

168
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
How close have they been

169
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,863
Because before the ABC researchers arrived

170
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:43,007
The physicist who developed the bomb had assumed that they wouldn't be finding survivors anywhere close to Ground Zero

171
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,055
What they called the hypocenter

172
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
But what became

173
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
Clear

174
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
Is it some people could be very close but weren't exposed to significant levels of radiation because they work she'll

175
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
And

176
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:01,439
Within about three blocks of the hypocenter at Hiroshima there were people in a basement

177
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
In a fairly large

178
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
Concrete building

179
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
Who survived

180
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:12,447
And further out from the hypocenter researchers discovered that people who had taken cover even momentarily

181
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,007
Didn't just survive the immediate blast

182
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
They seem to be healthy

183
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,127
So there's a very famous story about Nagasaki

184
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Which involved

185
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
Young boys who were

186
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Swimming

187
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,039
And they were diving off a

188
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Cliff

189
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,855
Into a lake

190
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
And

191
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,671
At the moment of detonation

192
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
Five of them were up

193
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,815
Standing up on the cliff and one of them had just hit the water and went under water

194
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,679
And all five who were on that Cliff where dead of leukemia by 1950

195
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
2

196
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,263
And the one who'd been underwater did not get

197
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,103
Anyone who had been behind even a tree

198
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,663
Was more likely to be alive

199
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,247
Five years later than someone who had been out in the open

200
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
And the logic of this is that

201
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,879
The key exposure to radiation

202
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
The most important moment

203
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
Last less than a second

204
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,351
It's not that there weren't other sources of radiation to be avoided

205
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,143
But What mattered most

206
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
Wisdom shielded at the moment

207
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
At the blast

208
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,103
And during the Blaster that followed it was the people who were standing up who were most likely to be

209
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,919
Be killed by shattering windows or falling debris

210
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,503
People who have been lying down when the blast wave hit

211
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
Much more often

212
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Survive

213
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,623
The lesson seemed clear

214
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
In the event of an atomic bomb

215
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
If you can stay low

216
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Stay shielded

217
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
In other words

218
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
If you duct

219
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
Uncovered

220
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
You might just be okay

221
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,983
American Civil Defense planners had already begun to wonder

222
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:55,359
Is Duck and Cover could help the population of a city survive a nuclear attack

223
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
What else might work

224
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,247
They were studying things like psychology and group dynamics and infrastructure

225
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,111
To see how society as a whole might hold up under a nuclear attack

226
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,695
And the civil defense policies that emerge from this research

227
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
All stressed in America

228
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
Could survive

229
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
But only if everyone

230
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,887
What does the authorities but everyday citizens did their part

231
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,471
What's the knowledge of the first atomic explosion to die.

232
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,847
Are chances for survival will be far better than those of the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

233
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
If we act on our knowledge

234
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
Underprepared

235
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
Like practicing proper Home Maintenance

236
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:36,575
I am going to show you how protective measures can help guard your home

237
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
I guess the heat effects of atomic explosion

238
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
Bandera Grill

239
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,975
Unknown

240
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,535
Warning is flag still on the civil defense network

241
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,863
Panamera Target City preparedness kits as concrete of test

242
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Does possible

243
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
Short of actual bombing

244
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,983
Even learning how to deal with irradiated soil

245
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775

Your livestock

248

Can survive

249
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
And in Lake County Indiana

250
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,575
They opted into a little pilot program to indicate their blood type

251
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
With a tattoo

252
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,647
All predicated on the belief that

253
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,951
In the face of an atomic attack

254
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Person

255
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
And a society

256
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
Might just survive

257
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
And my grandma

258
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
She says

259
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
She was pretty much on board

260
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,215
You don't have any particular memories of your first impressions of

261
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
The program

262
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,359
Yeah they were all positive I thought this was a good idea

263
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,967
Cheetahs for one thing it was a time when more people still trust the government

264
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,527
Well you're just coming off this big war

265
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Which

266
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,135
An impossibly complicated in all

267
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
Parts of the world

268
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,487
And yet somehow it had all come out all right

269
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,327
And so you felt as somebody was in charge that knew what he was doing

270
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,655
Plus the place you lived in Northern Indiana was a huge Railroad

271
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
And it was a possible Target

272
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,031
She didn't know for sure whether the tattoos would help her survive an attack

273
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,847
But she also genuinely believe that

274
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
They might

275
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
They're worth getting

276
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:11,039
Because if people were injured in would not be able to be assisted because you didn't know their blood type is

277
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,367
That's a no-brainer just go ahead and write it

278
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
Write it on them

279
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
Remember this was a voluntary

280
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
My grandmother signed up for

281
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
And so did most of her grade

282
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
She wanted to do her part

283
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
To be prepared

284
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
Because

285
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,519
Who knows who knows you know in all of the in the Japanese cities that were bombed there had to be a next day what do you do

286
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,103
The next day what do you do to save as many people as possible

287
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
The unthinkable thing

288
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
When it happens

289
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
You have to somehow react

290
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Do it

291
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,319
When I really listen to my grandmother this made sense to me

292
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,903
It made sense that people believe that the risk of an attack was real

293
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,743
And believe there was a way to be at least somewhat prepared

294
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,095
The problem is that not long after she got that tattoo

295
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
The premise behind it

296
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Survivability

297
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
Stop making sense

298
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,079
Even his children were learning to Duck and Cover and farmer for learning how to protect livestock from Fallout

299
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,407
The very idea of what a nuclear war might look like

300
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Mike was changing

301
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
And with it

302
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
Are chances of survival

303
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
In 1950s

304
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
Two years before operation tattoo

305
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,951
The Soviet Union had a grand total of 5 nuclear warheads

306
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
By 1960

307
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,815
They would have / 1600

308
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
Many of them thermonuclear weapon

309
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,983
Exponentially more powerful than the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

310
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:39,103
Susan Lennie thinks that civil defense tactics like the school tattoo

311
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,431
They might still opened in the event of a limited engagement

312
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,503
In which perhaps only a small number of cities forehead

313
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
So

314
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,831
It's not a blood transfusion wouldn't have

315
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
Mattered at all

316
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,695
But in the event of a global thermonuclear war

317
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:59,583
Destroyed the entire infrastructure of the United States

318
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,679
You're not imagining a still functioning Society outside of that

319
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,519
You're imagining that there aren't there are no doctors

320
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,591
To be rushed to the scene nobody can come from a neighboring

321
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,663
City of these children going to do

322
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
What are they going to do

323
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,343
Still government agencies like the civil defense Administration

324
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:26,719
Continue to promote the idea that the country could survive a full-throated nuclear attack

325
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,047
In part because the gospel of survivability

326
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
However imaginary

327
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
Still serves other functions

328
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,983
Sure imaginary things matter a lot especially in propaganda

329
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Because

330
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,311
A lot of military and civil defense planners

331
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
They didn't just worried there would be a war

332
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
They were convinced

333
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Warwick

334
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
Department of Defense the president

335
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Congress

336
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
Reach the conclusion

337
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,903
That developing and stockpiling ever-larger ever more powerful nuclear weapons

338
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,951
Was absolutely crucial

339
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
To the security and the future

340
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
Survival

341
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
Of the United States

342
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,119
Which is why by 1960

343
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,959
The same year the Soviet nuclear Arsenal top 1600 Warheads

344
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
The United States

345
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,543
Had more than 18000

346
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
Those weapons were controversial

347
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
Almost from the beginning

348
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:23,551
In one week in June demonstrations took place in more than a dozen countries and 250 locations around

349
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
United States

350
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:31,487
There were always protest within 24 hours of the dropping of the bomb there were critics all over the world saying

351
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
Find that the United States should not have used

352
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
If this keeps up

353
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
Then where does it stop

354
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
Do we live under the Sword of Damocles forever

355
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:45,055
And there were theologians who said this is an immoral form of warfare What's Happening Here

356
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,871
Play some moral and that we are in faith must resist

357
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,431
And that made the logic of survivability

358
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
Doubly useful

359
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,039
Things like lessons in school and evacuation drills

360
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
And tattoos

361
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,183
Is increasing the acceptability of nuclear weapons

362
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,791
And increasing public belief in the idea that even if a nuclear war came

363
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,863
There would be strategies that would permit

364
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,423
Those who were properly prepared

365
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
To survive

366
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
And did it work

367
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,031
Like do people feel less

368
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Scared

369
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
I think that

370
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639
Some people did maybe most people

371
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:26,015
Because when you look at surveys of people in the 50s about nuclear weapons

372
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
People

373
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
Believe that they're necessary

374
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
And if your

375
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,743
If you believe it's necessary then you have to believe that it's also

376
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,559
Practical but it's not insane

377
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
You have to believe it's not insane

378
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
Fear that my grandma got her tattoo

379
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,055
15 thousand other Lake County residents also got their blood type check

380
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
Do the typing program

381
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
Finger prick

382
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
Kappa Blood on the card

383
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,455
Two-thirds of those people opted for a tattoo

384
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,551
But operation tat type didn't go far outside Lake County

385
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,855
Despite all the survivability fervor

386
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,159
It never made it beyond the pilot program

387
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,487
When I talked to my grandma though I can kind of hear it

388
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
The thing when he talks about

389
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,839
About the psychological impact of programs like

390
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
Did getting a tattoo

391
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
Make you feel safer

392
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
Yes I guess so

393
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
I thought that I had done

394
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,151
The thing that was available to do to help in case of a

395
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
A total disaster

396
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,247
I thought I had done the right thing

397
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
But maybe more importantly it was just doing something that made her feel better it was hard to

398
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:42,047
To imagine the bigger picture I didn't envision myself

399
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,447
Elf lying there in a doctor's coming up and throwing up my arm and saying aha

400
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,263
Just use this child with O+ blood

401
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,079
I never played that all out

402
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
She said she was way too busy

403
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:00,223
She was talking with her friends about boys or what they were going to do over the weekend

404
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
Daily life

405
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,039
The life she was living

406
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
Was much more attractive

407
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,903
Otherwise would go crazy if we had to deal

408
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,487
Intensively with all of these terrible threats

409
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,791
What's a certain amount of stuff

410
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,375
I can't think about that you just got to keep going and do other things

411
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,727
I think that's that's one of the great capacities we have

412
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,431
Today the legacy of survivability is hidden behind a new series of titles acronyms

413
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
And other obfuscating symbols

414
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
B tomic bomb casualty commission which study the effects of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki

415
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,463
Who became the radiation effects Research Foundation

416
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:48,863
A joint american-japanese venture has continued to study the long-term effects on the survivors a bomb in there

417
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
Children nearly 75 years later

418
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,519
The federal civil defense Administration after several name changes

419
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:00,127
Was combined with various other agencies to form FEMA in 1978

420
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,223
It strategies have been adapted to deal with hurricanes or earthquakes

421
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
And yes

422
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,295
Possible nuclear attacks

423
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,439
And then there's the tiny Legacy of survivability Inked on the Torso of Carol fischler

424
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
Just under her left arm

425
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,279
Faded tattoo

426
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
It says o positive

427
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
But looks like a picture

428
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,655
The little hand mirror

429
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,967
Social Links professors Tracy Davis and Ann lauman at Northwestern University whose voices we did not get to him

430
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:40,831
Include but Who provided us with invaluable information during our research for the story

431
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
Up next

432
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,927
Shall we play a game

433
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,767
Joe Rosenberg and I play global thermonuclear war

434
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
Play with us

435
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,727
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

436
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,287
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

437
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:05,919
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

438
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:11,807
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is in another room and we're all hearing.

439
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
Technology talk to us

440
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,903
It is a creation of Sonic trash

441
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,976
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

442
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:24,352
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology to make them more human

443
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
Turn the living room lights on

444
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:29,984
Okay

445
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
Dim the living room lights

446
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,800
50%

447
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Okay

448
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,432
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake

449
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,992
Human and adding and some thoughtful sound

450
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,808
Makes for a much more natural experience

451
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,856
Turn the living room lights on

452
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
Dim the living room lights to 50

453
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
80%

454
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

455
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,448
Landscape is impacting our health

456
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,008
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

457
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,824
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

458
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,592
Right here

459
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,128
NPI phase

460
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:15,808
Okay so Roman do you remember the movie WarGames absolutely

461
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
Big deal when I was a kid

462
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:23,232
Oh yeah and I didn't and it's aged as you decided it's aged incredibly well

463
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
For those

464
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,304
Don't know it or don't remember it

465
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,864
Classic movies from the 80s

466
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,960
Where a teenager somehow single-handedly takes on the military and died

467
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:37,056
Compact genre and obviously

468
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
Stranger things has

469
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,360
A lot to it

470
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,456
Anyways in this case the teenager is played by a young Matthew

471
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
Free thirst

472
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
Accident

473
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,112
Quasi sentient computer Mainframe that runs NORAD

474
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:56,768
And once he's in this computer starts talking to him and it says free games would you like to play a game

475
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
List of stimulated

476
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,192
Dillard's the computer lights to play pops up and one of them is called global thermonuclear war

477
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:10,592
Wright brothers character is he a teenager he's like hell yes I want to play

478
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:15,968
But the computer tries to talk him out of it and it's like wouldn't you brother

479
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,232
And Broderick is like no

480
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,304
Thermonuclear war

481
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,216
And suddenly Broderick is present with this game map the world is laid out before him

482
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,776
You can start dropping bombs on cities

483
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
And see what happens

484
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:47,200
Intercourse things arriving there at hilarity ensues I won't spoil the movie for anyone

485
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
But when I first

486
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,552
Star War games when I was all about Anna 10 years old

487
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,344
I kept thinking man

488
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,744
Why can't I play a game called global thermonuclear war

489
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
Sounded

490
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
Well here's the thing

491
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,656
In doing some of the research for this story

492
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
26 years later

493
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,776
Kinda sorta founded

494
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
If this

495
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,848
Online simulator it's called

496
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:19,712
In which you can sing like the detonation of the nuclear weapon of your choice

497
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
At any spot in the club

498
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,784
You can see what

499
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,600
I'll get to it right out what's the address I need

500
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,136
Just Google in nukemap

501
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
Alex Miller

502
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,328
Here we go

503
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
Oh yeah

504
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,936
Drag the marker wherever you want in like at the Target or you can like tripe reset

505
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,776
Rights are used for statues which city that you'd like to destroy

506
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,568
I? Anywhere but there's

507
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,480
Do you have a preference to San Francisco

508
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,016
Well you know

509
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
I think it's only fair

510
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:00,160
I actually did the exact same thing as far as I can tell everyone that show this to like

511
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
They always immediately either nuke themselves

512
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,488
For New York

513
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,024
What will do Oakland

514
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,352
Enter the preset of a type of

515
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,632
Kiloton bomb

516
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,960
You can try a lot of different weapons real life

517
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,776
Choose from the actual usms Arsenal you can choose

518
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,592
Really tiny unicorn confusion weapons

519
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
Canon

520
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,664
Like a largest ever detonated

521
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
Hydrogen monster

522
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,504
Russian deli

523
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,552
Which Wich do you want

524
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
A listing of

525
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:33,952
Let's go for the big one so this is the Tsar Bomba largest USSR bomb tested at 50 Megaton

526
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
Guy looks like that

527
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,048
Okay basic options height of birth

528
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,328
Airburst or Surface

529
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
Cerberus

530
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
Explodes

531
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
About the city of Sandpoint

532
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,288
And I say Chozen airburst

533
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,080
50 megatons

534
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,640
Battery dropped pretty much right on Market Street

535
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,200
It's on 21st between Guerrero and

536
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:00,576
Not that any of this is going to matter cuz it's a

537
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,624
Beautiful red button it says detonate

538
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Pronounce

539
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,280
Totaling up the estimated fatalities

540
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,352
At 1.5 million people

541
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,936
It has this inner blast radius that's all red

542
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,520
Right in the matter but radius that reaches all the way to Antioch

543
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,544
And then a

544
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,824
I guess this is like

545
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Radio app

546
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,896
A cloud that reaches wellpath Sacramento

547
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
Yeah and

548
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,712
And actually with these big

549
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
You can see

550
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,344
That outer red ring is I believe like

551
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
Third degree

552
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,184
Yeah chocolate is pretty much

553
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,976
Going to take out the entire Bay Area

554
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,024
Sounds like what you expected

555
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,840
This is what we think of nuclear war

556
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,120
Look like

557
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
Total devastation

558
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
You don't even need to be

559
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
Close

560
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:52,288
People in the Central Valley might be okay but we here in Oakland right across the bay from SF

561
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,824
We're definitely

562
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,920
But we're actually valuable

563
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,480
Is if you ship things up just a bit

564
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,528
So I might run the exact same simulator

565
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,112
But this time I want you to choose the bomb called

566
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,160
Batman this was the bomb the United States drop

567
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
This is 20kg

568
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
There we go

569
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
All right

570
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Okay

571
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
San Francisco is in trouble still

572
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
Are you talking about

573
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288
70000 estimated

574
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
Fatalities

575
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
And

576
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
The

577
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
The air blast radius

578
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,432
It really reaches

579
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,504
You know only the 19th Avenue to the sunset

580
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,368
That's what I force you to that that's what kind of shocked me either original bombs that we think of Izzy's

581
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
Destiny Wednesday are devastating

582
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Compared

583
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Hydrogen weapon

584
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
Kind of shocking me

585
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:48,864
And he even like if you calculate like the Shockwave that would like break windows

586
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
That Shockwave

587
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,448
Doesn't even reach out

588
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
It doesn't even reach

589
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,056
Egyptian cuz what you what you start to realize if he's smaller

590
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
Boulder weather

591
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,104
Dance like a Russian

592
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
Nagasaki

593
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,456
They take out this big chunk from the center of a

594
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,528
It's just the shock everything outside the chunk

595
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
Is convent

596
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
We need to

597
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,904
What is an contacts in point out that in terms of

598
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,304
This is still an incredible catastrophe minimize

599
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,864
Those bombs were horrible and they killed a lot of people

600
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
But when you see

601
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,240
What some of the largest nuclear weapons the potential of them and

602
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,056
These smaller ones you realize that

603
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,104
This logic of survivability

604
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
It really isn't.

605
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,944
Right right so yeah and it's really

606
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
Helps demonstrate

607
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,040
This thing I always her just like we say in the story

608
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
Hydrogen nuclear weapons

609
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,136
Exponentially more powerful than conventional

610
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:50,048
But that doesn't really mean anything to me I was like hydrogen conventional whatever they're all bad

611
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
But in reality no

612
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,888
There is almost existential differ

613
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,680
Any amount of Destruction

614
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,216
Andaz

615
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,776
Life is grandmother puts it whether there's going to be a next

616
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Deorro

617
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Right

618
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,408
Consequences for how we think about

619
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,688
Nuclear threats

620
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:14,112
Because people get real fatalistic about the bomb they say things like what could you do there's nothing to do it's not

621
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
Not something I can deal with

622
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,672
It's not something I can do

623
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
So this is life Creator Alex

624
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:18,976
Sweater stain

625
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,280
The professor nuclear history

626
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,816
Stevens Institute of Technology

627
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,632
And also part of a project called Reinventing sibbald

628
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
He says

629
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,216
One reason he built the nuke map

630
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,544
Is that we're still basically holding on to this late

631
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,104
Cold War model assume you clear War at this

632
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Mobile app

633
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,712
Why bother thinking about it cuz if it happens

634
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,016
We're all Dad it's like getting a rare disease

635
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
Why worry

636
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,832
And that becomes the

637
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,112
The excuse to

638
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
Totally check

639
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,208
And it's not just checking out of

640
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,816
If something happened to them but it's checking out for it being like a national policy

641
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,608
Checking out on treaties

642
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
Checking out on

643
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,448
You know what the president allowed to do that kind of thing

644
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,056
And I really like people not to check out and I think the best

645
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,592
Way to do it

646
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,664
Is to get them to think about this more realistically

647
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,968
Until what is realistic in the sky

648
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,040
What's not particularly like was not real

649
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,344
In the current geopolitical climate

650
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,440
Is Russia bigger than China obliterating United States and half the world

651
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
Thousands of

652
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,560
Even though that's you know the scenario that most people

653
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
Like to grab it

654
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,704
They have a hard time shifting into none of them were talking about

655
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,008
Two or three detonations from North Korea

656
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:40,896
Nation is not going to be dead and then if you do that it is a little stressful then maybe it should be right

657
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,968
Because you you suddenly see it like oh

658
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
We should have a plan

659
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,064
And this is where nukemap comes in

660
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,856
Does it really helps convey the

661
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
Proper size

662
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,952
Cuz if you select for you know a North Korean side

663
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
That is one of the APA

664
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,304
You'll see it is larger than the Hiroshima bomb

665
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,376
Marco's Rothman terms

666
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
Kind of damage it does

667
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,936
Compared to these large

668
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
Okay

669
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
So weird

670
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,032
Feeling that there will be a neck

671
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,848
Hence the need for a plan

672
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,408
That totally makes sense so given this

673
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
What is

674
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,040
Well the big thing in Alex's mind

675
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,136
Now that we are once again presented with the possibility of these Limited

676
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,416
Nuclear scenarios

677
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,000
We as a culture need to relearn civil defense

678
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,096
Is that there are civil defense tactics you can find on the FEMA website like right now

679
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,632
In case of a nuclear attack

680
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
Alex's work

681
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:38,496
With the Reinventing civil defense project is in part about how

682
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,312
We could maybe actively disseminate this information

683
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,384
In a way that everyday people won't look askance at it either

684
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
Is Big Brother

685
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
Normalizing you

686
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
If he thinks

687
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
The feasible fantastic

688
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,904
And so what are the big things he'd like to

689
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
Is

690
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,424
Either hang of it in a very crude way this way if you're really too close to the weapon the nothing you do is going to matter and it's going to be over very fast

691
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:14,080
If you're really far away from the weapon you're going to say what was that no matter what you do because you're outside

692
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
Picture of an in-between range

693
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
Hours at work

694
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,712
Ducking and covering in some situations

695
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Is

696
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
Exactly the right thing to do

697
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,576
And this is for all the reasons that were laid out in the main

698
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,160
Which is avoiding direct exposure to radiation and heat protecting yourself

699
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:34,816
Structural damage and shattering Windows which you can see on these new maps North Korean size weapon

700
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,424
Even if you're relatively close to the epicenter you're much more likely to be in the zone of the Shockwave

701
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,496
Most likely not going to be in the all-consuming

702
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,104
Maybe the biggest takeaway from the nukemap simulator is what

703
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
Fallout

704
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,712
Because in this scenario where we survive from

705
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
Over here in our

706
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,808
Cushy confines vocalist

707
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
Actually we're not out of the

708
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,416
Prevailing winds come this way so we definitely have to deal with

709
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
In fact that's what

710
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,024
Presents the most danger to the most people in Houston area

711
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
The smaller one

712
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
I'll just a few weeks I'll be out of this feature

713
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:12,960
Which is kind of like Google Street View you can drop this little marker

714
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,544
Anywhere on the map and tell it whether you're indoors or Outdoors or

715
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
Basement

716
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
Basically tell you

717
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
How okay

718
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,456
Because you can see very starkly

719
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,760
Oh I'm stuck on the freeway

720
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,832
I mean absorbance of this much radiation in this case

721
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,136
However if I had just stayed at home

722
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:37,792
Then I cut it down to this much and if I go into a basement or someplace bigger while it's like basically nothing at all

723
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,120
You should run or shelter in place which is

724
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
Important

725
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
Right and you should almost

726
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,032
Always shelter-in-place tagline is get inside stains

727
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,080
Cuz even just being inside house

728
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
House will likely

729
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
Please save your life

730
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,968
But in this case it turns out there are limits

731
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
What kind of advice

732
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,296
However well backed up by data and

733
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
Nukemap

734
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,368
Human beings are willing to except

735
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,160
That's pretty when it comes to advice

736
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,768
Communication

737
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
And in fact

738
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
My colleagues asked people

739
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:17,984
They actually told them what the right thing to do is and then ask them what they would do in a lot of them are like I go get my kids

740
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,384
If there was a bomb went off or a fire happens when it's like so much better for kids just stay in school where they are

741
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
Am I impulsive

742
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
Totally true

743
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:32,576
Sadie you just ignore this and

744
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,648
Well I mean I'd rather them let them than me

745
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
That's for sure

746
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:42,560
But it would be really hard to fight the impulse to not run to them no matter what I knew in terms of Common Sense

747
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
I'd like to believe that I

748
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
Overcome that

749
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
Maternal instinct

750
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
Maybe once

751
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:57,920
But anyway

752
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:02,016
Latin for everyone the next time a computer program like math

753
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:06,880
Asked you if you want to play global thermonuclear war you should say yes

754
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,672
Absolutely nuke yourself

755
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:13,536
And it's actually the reasonable thing to do play at the simulation

756
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:22,240
Thank you

Might cost you your life

788
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:21,024
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

789
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,376
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

790
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,704
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

791
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,728
A dad

792
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,080
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

793
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,432
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main got to know how to do that kind of

794
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,456
I think

795
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:45,856
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

796
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,184
Was found dead in my private gym

797
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,512
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

798
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,864
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

799
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,192
Now I need to clear my name

800
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:05,568
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

801
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,592
