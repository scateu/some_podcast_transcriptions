This is 99% invisible

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
I'm Roman

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
And this week I'm talking to you

33
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,832
Directly the podcast audience who I like to call the 99

34
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Percentile

35
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
And not the radio people because

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
Took a week off the radio show

37
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Do some other work

38
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512
Can catch up on some things

39
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:14,144
But this is actually a piece that I really want to present to you because it's an older piece I did about a year-and-a-half ago for a

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Text show pilot

41
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,776
That never got picked up so it only got the pilot itself only got hurt by about

42
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
15

43
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
20 people

44
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,176
I really love this piece I put a lot of effort into it and I liked it a lot of my job

45
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,712
In general is to

46
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
Pilot shows in

47
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
And to work on new things

48
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
Sound design

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Do programs

50
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
But

51
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,136
The consequences that is sometimes you make radio that

52
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
That isn't on the radio

53
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
Which is weird

54
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,512
And so this is one of those pieces

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,096
It makes it so appropriate is this actually represent InDesign

56
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
Problem in the problem

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
Problem or design

58
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Challenge

59
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,984
Is how do we get humans on Mars

60
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
There's

61
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,336
Certainly technological solutions to this problem

62
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
There's a

63
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,664
Solutions that involve a lot of willpower and

64
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,480
Money maybe but there's also some out-of-the-box thinker

65
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Might come into play

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,880
Some of the information in the piece is a little old so it's about a year-and-a-half old

67
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
There used to be a constellation project

68
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,720
Does the Moon to Mars program that

69
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
Obama

70
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
When the world ran out

71
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
The money

72
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
And

73
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,120
I think that's about it but I'll most of it is still

74
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Pretty relevant

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
I think it's

76
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
I quite enjoyed

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,776
So I hope you enjoy it too so this the 99% invisible this week

78
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,080
It's called one-way ticket to Mars

79
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Ignition

80
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
We can get tomorrow

81
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
That's easy

82
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,344
Break Earth's gravity in hurdle towards the red planet is

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,904
Totally doable the science fiction Park

84
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,744
Detect problem NASA says we'll take four decades to solve

85
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
It's how to get back

86
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
You can't carry enough fuel for a round trip

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
To have a

88
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,680
We'll have to make new fuel up there

89
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Literally

90
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,496
Big of mine on Mars Harvest minerals

91
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
Whip up a nuclear reactor

92
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
Simple rocket

93
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,592
Not easy

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,152
But if you really want to go to Mars

95
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,224
Like now if you can't possibly wait any longer

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
James McClean

97
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Has another plan

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
I think what we should have

99
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
Is a short program

100
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,696
Possibly a ten-year program like the Apollo program

101
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Where we were

102
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
Actually

103
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,071
Devault equipment in Land one person

104
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
On Mars

105
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,423
And we would keep that person we saw

106
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Supply

107
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,799
The prime thing that makes this feasible is that you don't plan on bringing this person back

108
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
I would have let that sink in

109
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Alrighty

110
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,575
Play is now an oil and gas pipeline engineer over 20 years he worked for NASA

111
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,135
Safety Systems and the International Space Station

112
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,463
I know he no longer has anything to do with space you still

113
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
A man on a mission

114
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
I began to disturb that there were options as far as space travel to other plan

115
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,935
Planets that NASA wasn't

116
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:01,823
Considering I brought up in a technical meeting once it a guy was giving a presentation about NASA's

117
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Plans for the future

118
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
He raises his hand and says this guy

119
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
When I send one person one way

120
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,319
One person because it cuts down on the weights applied to a manageable level

121
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,879
In one way because getting them back

122
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
It's really really hard

123
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:21,023
He was just astonished that anyone would would even mention such a thing at Justice

124
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,071
It sounded almost immoral

125
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
But the more I thought about this the more I

126
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,215
I realize that it was it was actually

127
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
Probably the only way that

128
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Wechat

129
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,663
See this thing happen and you know what in our lifetime of the current generation here on Earth

130
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
Because all of the other schemes that I read about

131
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,343
Involve developing a exotic equipments going to take 50 years

132
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,415
You could call it a suicide mission and many people have

133
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:53,279
McLean says it's really no more of a suicide mission than the early Vikings making their way to North America

134
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
But I think it's really no more of a suicide mission than life

135
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Itself

136
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,703
Explore would be going to live out a life on Mars

137
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Dramatically

138
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Shortened

139
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
Unbelievably harsh life

140
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
None the less

141
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,455
Well it wouldn't it would not be pleasant that's putting it mildly

142
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,527
It would be I guess like living in a submarine

143
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,111
You would probably live in a habitat that was covered with

144
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Dirt

145
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,951
So you would only go outside occasionally

146
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,511
The conditions would be so Danger

147
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,839
Boris has a poisonous low-pressure atmosphere

148
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
Terry spacesuit better work

149
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
Forever

150
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:36,543
But that's assuming that you can leave your base at all because Mars is also home to the Solar System's largest

151
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
Dust storm

152
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
I can cover the entire planet

153
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Vermont

154
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
And if anything breaks

155
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
Your toast

156
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Or more accurately

157
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Your pops

158
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,319
Because it can get down to 190 degrees below zero

159
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,135
Then there's the cancer-causing cosmic radiation

160
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,207
You better hope not

161
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
And it's only a suicide mission

162
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
From the astronauts perspect

163
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
The problem is that for NASA

164
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
It's more of a homicide mission

165
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,447
And that's a little harder to sell to Congress

166
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,263
But explorers get it

167
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,335
Mister second man on the moon himself Buzz Aldrin

168
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,871
Says the one way trip

169
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
Is the way to go

170
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
You really thick

171
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,759
You have trouble getting volunteers for The Greatest Adventure

172
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
In history

173
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
Right now the space shuttle

174
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,367
Has been demonstrated to be nice

175
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:26,207
Greenlee extremely dangerous a vehicle but

176
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,511
People are standing in line to get a chance to

177
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:33,631
Reply on the fastest thing on the planet people are willing to take that risk

178
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:39,007
For the chance of doing something remarkable this person is going to be more than just

179
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
Somebody to go down in history

180
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,871
If this person will be it will be like a

181
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,455
An Adam or Eve type figure legendary

182
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
Plus I have to admit

183
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
There's something about it

184
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
Captures the imagination

185
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
Doom

186
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
Lone Explorer in a

187
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
Cleaning metal tube

188
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,767
Daily Transmissions back home

189
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
It would be poetic

190
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
Beautiful

191
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
I'm kind of inspiring

192
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
It horrible

193
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
McCobb

194
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,471
It would be riveting

195
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:14,591
And it's probably never going to happen I think that's a non-starter from NASA

196
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,407
We're not going to send astronauts to Mars

197
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Without the case

198
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
That's Chris McKay

199
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
Doctor Killjoy

200
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
I'm the deputy program scientist

201
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
Of the constellation

202
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
Activity in constellation

203
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
NASA

204
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,487
Turn to the moon on to Mars human exploration Pro

205
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,047
So he's actually planning NASA's manned mission

206
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,375
Well I personally I I wouldn't want to go in at 1

207
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,703
Play Mission and also I like the idea of that

208
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,311
We bring Mars into the sphere of human activity which means we going come and we going come

209
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
I don't see why we have to

210
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,663
Surrender to the technological challenges

211
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
Say okay this is impossible

212
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
Can't do it

213
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
I think

214
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
That's a cop out

215
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,063
What we ought to do is say well let's build better Rock

216
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,367
It's come on you guys engineers get to work

217
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
One round trip

218
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,255
Chris McKay and NASA think we should go to Mars once we're ready to establish a long-term base

219
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
Something like the Antarctic base

220
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,375
But there are humans there year-round coming and going and doing research

221
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
Boldly stay

222
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
Paraphrasing start

223
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
That becomes

224
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Rotational

225
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
Innocence

226
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
What's the rush

227
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
Why why do we need to rush them

228
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
The author of The One Way plan James McClain is

229
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
64

230
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
So for him

231
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
There is a rush

232
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Well it's

233
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,879
Some of these questions would be nice to answering in my lifetime I like to know the answer

234
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
I'd like to know the answer

235
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
People say well

236
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,255
If you want to see it in your lifetime

237
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,119
Respond well I'm not that old maybe I will with 40 more years

238
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:47,519
Unlikely but hey I go running everyday and I don't smoke the fact that it's in my lifetime or not is really not an important

239
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
Consideration NASA shouldn't

240
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,663
Major decisions based on the lifetime of its current scientists and engineers

241
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
And of course

242
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
That makes good practical sense

243
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:02,367
But isn't there something to this idea of a bold Apollo like 10 year mission to excite the imagination

244
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
No matter what the cost

245
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
Shouldn't we recapture

246
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,975
The Thrill of the space race

247
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
The way you win a race

248
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Is

249
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,839
You exert yourself fully during the race

250
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
Even if it means that after the race you clap

251
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,471
Blob at the end of the finish line

252
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,823
And that's what we did at Apollo we exerted enormous effort we took our best people

253
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
Push them as hard as we could

254
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
And we won the race

255
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
And then

256
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
We clocked

257
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
At the end of it

258
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,039
The political context for space exploration now is very different than a race

259
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
The Apollo president

260
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Is not the president

261
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
Follow here

262
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
And that's a big problem

263
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:42,047
Apollo was NASA's golden age when anyone talks about returning NASA to it

264
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
Former glory

265
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
That's the model they point to

266
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,423
Except for a small block of Interest training

267
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
Space camp craze of the 80s

268
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,799
The Solera of NASA only grabbed the attention of the world

269
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
When there was a horrible

270
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
Horrible track

271
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,223
James McClean ask you to imagine nightly broadcast

272
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Mars day

273
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
Pairing with an astronaut

274
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,599
Over the edge of a crater five times deeper than the grand

275
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,183
Hearing stories from the base of a volcano so tall

276
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
It nearly reaches space itself

277
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:16,863
That's a beautiful sight in front row seats to the greatest and coolest Hail Mary pass

278
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
The history of humankind

279
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
One man one way McLean says

280
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,519
Inspiring NASA of his

281
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
But you can feel it and Mars

282
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Slipping away

283
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,175
They won't even study the option

284
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
If they set up a small task

285
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Force

286
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:39,391
Turn office to study this particular option I believe it would be obvious just from the technical stuff

287
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
Daddy's that this is the only way it could be done

288
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,511
Relatively low cost

289
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,327
And in a relatively short period of time

290
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,143
All of the other schemes are going to Mars

291
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,935
There's no way it's going to happen

292
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Anytime

293
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
Futura forever

294
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
Forever is too long

295
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,615
Whether we follow the one-way plan or not

296
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,431
Maybe more than out-of-the-box thinking what we really need

297
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,247
Is another country to come along and start talking trash

298
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
Doris back into the starting blocks of another space race

299
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
China

300
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
I'm looking at you

301
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
I'm Roman Mars the guy

302
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
The modern world

303
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
Pleasant 99% invisible for this week

304
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,319
Originally broadcast into the headphones of some muckety-muck

305
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:46,719
At a public radio production and distribution company who did not like it enough to put it on the radio

306
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,303
Was good wasn't it I don't know what they're talking about

307
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:56,959
Anyway I hope you enjoyed it I got to stretch my legs a little bit this week little longer than 4 and 1/2 minutes everyone happy now

308
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:03,615
Thank you very much like I want to show how much time I have

309
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,919
Only have on the radio so

310
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
Maybe you'll be longer someday I kind of like it

311
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
The challenge

312
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,319
I hope you enjoyed it

313
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,391
I'm really Mars at 1% invisible

314
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,695
Take care and I'll talk to you next week

315
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,679
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

316
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,263
Series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

317
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
The body genius is a dark

318
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
Comic mystery

319
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,407
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

320
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
We're looking the part

321
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
Might cost you your life

322
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,855
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

323
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,207
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

324
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,535
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

325
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Adad

326
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,911
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

327
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:03,263
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main got to know how to do that kind

328
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,663
I think a few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action

329
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
A movie called Immortal cop

330
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,343
Was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

331
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
Even worse

332
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,975
The cops think that I had something to do with it now

333
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
I need to clear my name

334
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,423
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

335
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:39,615
The final episode of the body genius drops on May 30th Bend all 5 Parts on the truth podcast

336
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
