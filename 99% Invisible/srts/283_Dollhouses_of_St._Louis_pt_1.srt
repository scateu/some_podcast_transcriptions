I'm Roman Mars

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,512
In the early 1950s Sam Moore and his family left rule Arkansas looking to start a new life

29
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,560
They planned on moving to Chicago

30
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,168
We were on our way to Chicago with all I worldly possessions and I dog spot

31
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,520
And we start off in my Granddaddy's 53 dynaflow Buick

32
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,848
And got the same Lewis and ran out of gas

33
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
And instead of continuing on to Illinois

34
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,480
Where's family just decided to stay

35
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,552
They settled in a middle-class area called The Ville

36
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:05,184
St Louis was segregated and the bill was one of the only African-American neighborhoods in the city

37
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
The residence of the best of it

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Metro Porter Zach Dyer

39
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,168
Black owned businesses thrived in the neighborhood became one of the most prosperous African American communities in the country

40
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,752
Do you mind if we just roll the windows up

41
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
Just for that recording

42
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,080
Okay I turn the air on

43
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
Seymour's dad got a job as a bricklayer

44
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,480
And help build some of the beautiful stately brick homes in this area

45
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:33,856
He was a great break that he didn't quite a few jobs around this town I shall see some of my dad's work

46
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
Oh wow really

47
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,720
Beautiful homes

48

Triple break three-story two-story buildings

We're more has lived for almost his entire life and is now the alderman

53
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
Neighborhood looks very different

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,944
We pull up in front of a couple of old houses

55
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Hold on one sec

56
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,296
How many days to build a look at that building

57
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
You can see clean through it

58
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,928
From the street the building facade look normal

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,512
It's a two-story brick home sitting on a white Limestone base

60
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,584
Rounded brick Arch his friend the first-floor windows

61
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,960
Had just around the corner and you can see that the entire sidewall is Miss

62
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
The bricks are just

63
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
Gone

64
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
You can see straight into the room

65
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
Each with a different wallpaper

66
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,456
We call him doll houses because you can look inside of them and see what's going on

67
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,064
Ramona little girls play with the doll house and put the furniture and you can see it

68
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
Jan in the wall

69
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,464
In the past 50 years the city of St Louis has lost more than half its population

70
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
Vacancy has skyrocketed in the Ville

71
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
Another neighborhoods on the Northside

72
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,632
Entire neighborhoods here are just green pasture

73
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:55,008
Punctuated by the occasional dilapidated building that slowly surrendering to the landscape around it

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,360
Alderman back in 2007

75
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,456
He started to get calls from his constituents complaining about these collapsing building

76
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,552
To discover why they were falling down

77
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,880
I figured it was probably just because they were so old

78
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,488
But didn't notice that something was strange about these so-called dollhouse

79
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,583
They were surrounded by piles of Broken Bricks and debris

80
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
But something was missing

81
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,423
I often wonder why

82
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
I never saw a whole brick

83
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,335
If the buildings were falling down into piles but there weren't any holbrooks

84
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
Nose piles

85
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,919
More knew it meant someone was taking them

86
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Salvage bricks

87
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Are valuable

88
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:41,343
There's a market for them just like there's a market for the copper that gets stripped out of old homes

89
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,439
A pickup truck full of old bricks could be worth upwards of $300

90
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,767
But these bricks weren't being salvaged legally

91
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
There was or not legal demolition

92
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
Project stay with death

93
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Bricktown

94
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,495
I miss that was happening on a massive scale in Morris District

95
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,335
Why have 1242 empty buildings

96
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,895
And 1700 vacant Lots

97
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,247
So out of the 1700 bacon lines I guarantee you that

98
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
1200 mosto

99
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,623
Despite these being vacant houses

100
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,183
All of this brick theft is a problem

101
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
When a building's bricks get stolen

102
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,791
The house usually can't be resold

103
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,119
It also takes money out of the pockets of illegal demolition worker

104
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
And it stalls Redevelopment

105
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
Because you can't sell a building

106
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,263
You can't guarantee that I will be there next week

107
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
But there's also something

108
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,359
Intangible that's lost with bricks

109
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:42,015
The bill has been home to famous African Americans like Chuck Berry Tina Turner and the opera singer Grace bumbry

110
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575
I remember the grace bumbry house

111
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
That house was

112
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
Stole

113
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
News column old Wagner building but

114
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,791
A lot of our history was taken away and stole as well

115
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,911
Brick theft has been going on all across St Louis since at least the 1970s

116
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:02,495
Whole buildings whole blocks whole parts of neighborhood

117
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Being stolen

118
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
Card off illegally

119
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
Cancel

120
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,455
How and where in the United States can somebody steal a whole building

121
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
And not get caught

122
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,135
St Louis history with a break starts back in 1849

123
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
The boat fire on the riverfront

124
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
Jump into the city

125
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,047
Hundreds of wooden buildings along the river burn the ground

126
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,959
Devastation with the city government to order that all new buildings be constructed with fireproof materials

127
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,079
The city happen to be sitting on top of a high-quality clay

128
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,687
As well as the coal that would be needed to fire the Kilns to turn that clay into brick

129
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:47,807
Well I can show you a couple of these different kinds of bricks and

130
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,159
Andrew Wiles executive director of the landmarks Association of St Louis

131
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Behind his desk

132
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:58,303
You got a giant frame tutorial map of the city back in the late 1800s

133
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,143
The landscape is dotted with evidence of the Cities once-thriving brick industry

134
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,959
It's covered with mines and smokestacks

135
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
You'll see

136
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,823
Some smoke stacks and you'll see

137
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
You know some

138
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,943
Derek set up a winches setup over over Minds

139
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,503
I'm some pit mines you also CDs

140
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
Beehive Kilns they look like big lips

141
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:25,951
The red clay industry was so big that folks were even digging mind and their backyards to get this.

142
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,255
And all this new industry attracted others

143
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
St.Louis

144
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,887
In the decades to come waves of migrants from across Europe and the southern us

145
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
Lock the city

146
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
It was a Boomtown

147
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
So it's for The Perfect Storm

148
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
Of materials

149
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Labor

150
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,871
Command industrial innovation

151
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,711
That can bind to two mixing Lewis into this brick producing

152
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Powerhouse

153
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
1890

154
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,599
St Louis was home to the world's largest brick manufacturing company

155
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:58,463
Millions of bricks were exported across the country to build skyscrapers in Chicago

156
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,279
And other buildings across the western and southern United States

157
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
Bricks for cheap

158
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
And plentiful

159
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
Anatman

160
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,911
But even modest working-class homes in St Louis

161
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,959
Could have one of a kind brickwork

162
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
But not just blank facade

163
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
Do they have this for

164
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,567
Corbelling extensions

165
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
Recesses

166
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,407
And ornamental Bricks Built into them

167
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,223
Pressed flowers art designs

168
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
String courses

169
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
Things like that

170
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,135
But even as these beautiful brick homes were going up all across the city

171
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,463
The conditions for the city's eventual semi abandonment

172
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
We're also being put in place

173
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
In the early nineteen hundreds St Louis was forcing its black citizens to live in segregated neighborhoods when the practice was

174
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:48,127
Found unconstitutional Realtors began asking homeowners in St Louis to sign something called Raceway

175
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
Corrective deed covenants the homeowner and future homeowners property to African American

176
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
And other minority groups

177
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,719
Here's calling Gordon a history professor at the University of Iowa when realtor has assessed properties for sale

178
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:09,119
High in St Louis in a well into the 1960s one of the standard items on the assessment form was

179
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:15,519
The nearest negro Community or the degree to which Negroes had invaded Orange

180
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
Treated funda neighborhood

181
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:23,455
And is Invasion a word that was used in these documents

182
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,039
Intrusion by invasion

183
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
Not only were African-Americans blocks

184
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,951
Certain neighborhoods by these racist deed Covenants

185
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,279
The city was also bulldozing black neighborhoods

186
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,095
From massive new projects like the Gateway Arch

187
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,655
This was the age of urban renewal

188
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Increasingly

189
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,799
We are seeing large-scale demolition is the first step in building modern cities

190
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,871
In this jet age events move fast

191
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,431
Faster indeed than we sometimes realize

192
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
Study

193
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,575
As we clear away the structures that block progress

194
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,207
In the 1950s white residents have started to leave the city entirely

195
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,071
The departure was facilitated by the recent development of the highway system and by the GI Bill

196
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,887
Which gave white veterans easy access to home loans

197
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,703
While largely denying black veterans the same right

198
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,519
White flight was happening all over the country

199
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
In St Louis was no exception

200
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:27,199
That's why it's rush to the suburbs the City's population declined and its tax revenues Plumbing

201
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
By the 1970s

202
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,319
African Americans with the means started moving out of the city 2

203
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,135
We lost over half a million people

204
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,255
In the city since 1950 so we have a huge problem with vacancy

205
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,071
Andrew Weil again from the landmarks Association

206
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
And

207
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
At the same time

208
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:51,263
The neighborhoods that are vacant were built of incredibly high quality materials

209
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
Find incredibly durable material

210
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:58,431
Most of the brick that's being stolen in St Louis is a hundred or hundred twenty years old suits

211
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
It's really at the beginning of its lifespan

212
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,807
Bricks can last for hundreds of years

213
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:10,463
The Fallout from Decades of racist housing policies in disinvestment in the north side

214
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,095
Who created communities with a bricks themselves are worth more than the homes they support

215
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
The only reason these buildings

216
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,679
Can be still on his because

217
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
They are perceived

218
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
To have no value

219
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
So

220
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,591
If the building is perceived to have no value and there are

221
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
Eyes watching it

222
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
You know it's the perfect opportunity for a

223
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
Disappear

224
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,063
By the time Sam Moore and become Alderman in 2007

225
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,623
Brick theft had already been going on for decades

226
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
I've been much of an effort by the city to stop at

227
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
Some more sand out to figure out

228
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
Who was stealing bricks

229
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
How

230
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
To start

231
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
He did what any gumshoe would do

232
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
He went on some Steakhouse

233
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:56,287
That was some Steeler bricks and follow them to the Brickyard where they sell them and wonder why

234
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
What does City's a tiny legal

235
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,919
Organization like that of a business by Brick

236
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,783
These Bricks leaves have found that abandoned houses represent remarkably easy target

237
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,391
So easy but sometimes people are coming in from as far away as Las Vegas

238
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
It's not actually hard to tear the buildings down

239
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
People go about it in a few different ways

240
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,095
So the guy get up at 6 in the morning

241
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
And

242
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
Get on a bicycle

243
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
And take a screwdriver

244
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
And pick him out

245
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,591
67 bricks out of the wall

246
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
Rare / wall

247
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
That's all it takes

248
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
Make a hole in the wall

249
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,527
Sliding metal pipe in the hole attached to a chain

250
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
Give yourself enough clearance

251
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Impulse

252
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
Instant demolition

253
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,463
The thieves had figured out how to steal bricks even in busy areas

254
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,279
They just take out the back wall of the house

255
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,559
Hidden from View

256
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,631
This is a busy street so what they did was

257
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,679
It took the back out of this one

258
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
Look to your right

259
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
Oh I see now

260
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
You're right

261
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
So literally like the whole building is

262
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,271
The back of the building is gone and there's a tree that's growing up in it

263
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,367
Do you write the whole building it's just there's nothing there in the back

264
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,207
There are various ways to steal an entire wall a brick

265
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,279
Some people run a cable through one window and out another

266
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
And attach it to a truck and pull

267
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,423
Or they've used backhoes that were contracted for other legal demolition jobs

268
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
They would drive him over in the night

269
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
Knock down an abandoned house

270
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
And then return later to steal the brick

271
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,895
One of the more drastic methods of stealing bricks

272
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
Involves burning the buildings first

273
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,807
The fire destroys the wooden supports holding up the building and weekends the mortar between the bricks

274
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,367
And the fire department arrived to put out the fire

275
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:51,231
They're high pressure hoses off a knock down the walls and even clean the mortar off the brick

276
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,863
Michael Allen is a preservationist who used to live in North St Louis back in 2008

277
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,471
Theft was at its worst and dozens of buildings were being stolen each month

278
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,823
Bad person work with some neighbors reported up buildings that were imported

279
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
Sweetheart waiting for the city we

280
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:12,991
Nailed shut the doors to keep people out of them from setting the fires inside

281
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
And then meal baby

282
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
On fire

283
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
Didn't seem real

284
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,183
Driving out to go get groceries

285
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
Spellings of Adams Dolan

286
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
Send otherworldly

287
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,351
Stealing the buildings is backbreaking work

288
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Dangerous

289
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,447
Hit a couple times we have found people

290
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
Upside down in the rubble baby got caught

291
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
The Brits call them and kill them

292
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,663
Eventually Alderman Moore

293
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,247
Set up was sitting in his car and watching all this happened to his neighborhood

294
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,575
So he started to confront the fees when he would find them

295
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,671
People been wanting me man sound they got gun they don't like you

296
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,999
You need to stop run up on people so ask

297
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,303
I took his advice I stopped riding a bull

298
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,423
More eventually realize his interventions weren't making much of a difference anyway

299
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,239
Brick that is classified as a nuisance crime

300
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,799
Kind of like breaking windows in an old building

301
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
Carries a maximum $500 fine

302
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,151
And up in 90 days in jail

303
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,735
Given the amount of money that can be made selling stolen brick

304
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
A lot of people figure it's a risk

305
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Worth taking

306
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,159
2 Min what makes used 4X so special and desirable is the

307
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
The color

308
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
This is Barbara Bach

309
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,535
Xi'an Century used brick is a brick yard in St Louis

310
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:36,191
And so when they tear the building down you'll get like this mix of colors of oranges and reds

311
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
And it's really hard

312
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,311
It's been really hard for New Brick manufacturers to duplicate that

313
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:46,175
Book says her Brickyard is scrupulous about only buying legally Salvage brick

314
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,247
Typically buy from just a handful of trusted vendors

315
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,783
Because we're legal

316
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,343
We have to know exactly where it comes from

317
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
So

318
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:59,999
If we don't we don't usually have people showing up at our yard with just a pal you're trying to sell a pallet

319
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
Starbucks has their other brick buyers

320
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,607
That aren't as careful as she is

321
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:09,471
There was a guy in St Louis that people were he was buying brick

322
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
You know after hours

323
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,847
1 in the morning you could get a shopping cart fill it full of brick

324
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:19,711
Go get money and go buy your drugs and he was doing a huge business

325
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
And then

326
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
Please shut him down

327
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:28,671
Book explained to me that the supply of Legally Salvage bricks is driven mostly by city-funded demolition

328
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,511
So when the city runs out of money to tear down old buildings

329
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,327
More brickyards are willing to turn a blind eye

330
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
The brick acquired illegally

331
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,167
And so that's when it gets

332
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
You know tempting to

333
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
Police car

334
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,031
Bastille brick and sell it

335
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
Because they know there's

336
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,615
A lot of demand and no Supply

337
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,687
Some of the Breck whether it's weekly salvaged or not

338
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,759
Goes to building or renovating new homes in St Louis

339
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,831
The most of it heads to another part of the country entirely

340
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,159
David said most of it goes to Louisiana

341
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,047
And we saw some in Florida we sell some in Mississippi we sell in Texas

342
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583
So there's

343
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,655
You know Southern markets that really love our brick

344
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,751
I'm 63 years old I've been doing this since I was 18

345
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:20,127
And I've seen in her just about anything you can think of in the brick business so

346
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,967
Gary McConnell Owens McConnell brick in Baton Rouge Louisiana

347
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
And he's been buying salvaged brick

348
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
For decades

349
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,575
When demand was at a time

350
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,159
Who's getting boxcars full of used brick from St Louis

351
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,743
Newbreak might sell for around $350 per thousand

352
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Old Brick

353
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
On the other hand

354
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
Logo for almost 2 times

355
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,423
For example we sell St Louis brick for 675 1000

356
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:49,055
There are a few reasons why there's such a high demand for salvaged bricks in Southern United

357
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
States where McDonald's from

358
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
For one thing

359
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,919
1960s and 70s

360
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,991
As neighborhoods in St Louis we're starting to hollow out

361
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,087
A new style of architecture in the South with creating a market for used brick

362
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
We had an architect in

363
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,183
In Louisiana named a Hays town

364
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
And he was the first

365
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Person that I know of and I was

366
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
A kid back then but

367
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Started

368
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,935
Designing houses using Salvage material

369
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,263
Town with influence by Antebellum Southern architecture

370
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
Course you know where down south

371
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
We have plantation homes

372
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:27,199
All those old old plantation mansions and

373
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Stop

374
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,271
The brick were actually made on site

375
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,575
My Insite workers living on the plantation

376
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
And they would

377
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
Make the brick

378
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,207
And put them all these houses so when Mr town

379
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
Hiss hiss

380
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,327
Reputation and his flare was to replicate

381
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,399
Some of these old plantation home so

382
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,447
The only way that you could do that was

383
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
How to use antique

384
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Brick

385
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:54,335
Towns designs called for used brick not just for the facades of homes

386
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Respect for the flooring

387
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,407
Courtyard patios and pool deck

388
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
Even today

389
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:04,063
Some neighborhoods in Baton Rouge require all new construction to use reclaimed brick

390
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,135
Demand for that weathered look has gotten so high

391
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,231
But only the wealthiest homeowners can afford to have salvaged brick

392
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
Lyrics

393
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
Expecting that

394
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
Have

395
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
Salvaged brick or

396
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
You know

397
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,703
Old Brick floors or pine beams or pine flooring

398
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,519
Any kind of antique salvage stuff they're expecting

399
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,335
To see that in those upper in houses

400
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,407
Aside from this desire for an antique look

401
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:35,039
Is another reason why so much use bread from St Louis is headed to the Gulf Coast and out west

402
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
It's because

403
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
Not all bricks

404
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Are created equal

405
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
The exterior layer of brick

406
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
The face

407
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,071
Produced in St Louis is fired in such a way that it helps it withstand the freezing Winters in the Midwest

408
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
Interior brick is softer

409
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
Can't stand up to the elements

410
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,823
In the 1960s and 70s St Louis home builders in the suburbs who started using reclaimed brick from the city got a

411
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
A nasty surprise

412
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
Brick facades

413
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,175
Were crumbling away

414
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,991
If you're going to put used brick on a new home

415
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,295
There has to be someone at the demolition site

416
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,367
Separating out the face brick from the interior

417
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,439
That's something demolition companies can't

418
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
Or won't pay for

419
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:20,607
The easiest thing for them to do is just ship all of the bricks down to warmer climates

420
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:24,447
Or even the softer ones can be used on the exteriors of buildings

421
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,895
To me there's something sad about the beautiful old houses Own St Louis being torn down to build beautiful old

422
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,175
Looking houses

423
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Somewhere else

424
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
Barbara buck

425
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,783
Who runs the St Louis Brickyard agrees

426
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,135
You know there are just times when I'll go to a building that I know is coming down

427
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,439
And I just feel

428
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
So sad

429
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:50,559
Because I think about the family and I'm very sentimental I think about

430
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
The family

431
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:56,959
The live there I think about the family that built that house I think about the generations that were raised in that house

432
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
But she's also practical

433
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,079
Mini houses can't and maybe shouldn't be saved

434
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
We don't have

435
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:09,247
The population we don't have the jobs to support those houses and everything has a life

436
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
Spent

437
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,647
The worst of the brick theft is over today

438
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,720
Some of the Brickyard that had a history of buying stolen bricks

439
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,024
We're shut down with the help of city workers

440
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,072
Local activists and representatives

441
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
Like ornaments and more

442
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
Brick yards in St Louis

443
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,472
Are now required to photograph whoever salesmen Bragg

444
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,032
Along with the Demolition permit for that job

445
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,128
Now the question is how to reinvent What's Left Behind

446
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,712
I'm doing I'm doing a brick interview

447
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,528
Brick interview you know I'm the big man

448
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
Jacksonville

449
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:48,160
More shows me some of the things they're doing with the vacant Lots in the neighborhood

450
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:54,816
We pull up next to a fence decorated with life-size portraits of old Negro League baseball players from the 1930s

451
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,888
Behind the fence is one of Morris projects

452
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
An urban farm

453
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,776
This is called the vilard today who got about 50 fruit trees in it

454
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,080
Regarding tilapia fish

455
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,688
And catfish forgot to hatchery in there we got chicken

456
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
Got to work

457
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,040
And there's new housing being built in the jail to

458
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,136
But not the same kind of stately homes that the neighborhood used to be known

459
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,464
It take a million-dollar bill to mow houses over again

460
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
So

461
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:29,888
We want makes you so now I think they look good and it seems it has the neighborhood

462
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,240
More shows me some of the new houses

463
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:39,104
A traditional brick home in this neighborhood would have been made with walls that were three brick

464
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Mystery

465
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,456
Ounces look kind of like the old one

466
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,272
Up close you can see that there's something

467
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
It's not a whole brick

468
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,624
Overlook clip-on gadgets

469
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,976
Is niacin is a flat surface is about 3/4 inch thick

470
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,280
Souvenir of a

471
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Power brick

472
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,400
The clip-on Brick Works just like siding on a house

473
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:09,312
It's a slice of used or manufactured brick attached to the wooden frame of the building to give it that look of a

474
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
Brick home

475
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:16,480
These homes with their brick veneer are far cheaper to build and will likely be the new face of the Ville

476
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:21,088
They're not as ornate as the old turn of century houses that used to define this neighborhood

477
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
Therefore debility gets more people to move in

478
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
To lower the vacancy rate

479
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,976
And that's what counts

480
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,792
Better to have a neighborhood full of life

481
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
Even if the brake is fake

482
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
Replaces dollhouse

483
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
With real houses

484
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:52,064
A lot of cities were ravaged by fire in the mid-nineteenth century

485
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,624
St.Louis reacted by building everything with breath

486
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,720
But when San Francisco burned down it use brick in another novel way

487
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
Biblical extra story about that

488
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
After that

489
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
Between the beats

490
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,168
Bongs and Charter of our devices

491
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,752
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

492
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
If

493
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:18,176
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

494
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
Technology talk to us

495
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
It is a creation of Sonic trash

496
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,184
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

497
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,768
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

498
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,816
To make them more human

499
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,912
Turn the living room lights on

500
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Okay

501
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,496
Dim the living room lights to 50

502
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
80%

503
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Okay

504
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:51,456
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

505
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,272
Makes for a much more natural experience

506
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Turn the living room lights on

507
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,416
Dim the living room lights to 50%

508
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,840
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

509
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
About how are sounds game

510
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,912
Is impacting our health

511
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,216
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

512
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,288
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

513
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,336
Right here on the 9th 9 p.m.

514
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,688
We need to talk about something

515
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:29,088
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet

516
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:35,488
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptom

517
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,280
Comes come back again and again

518
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,864
And you don't know why then it may be time to seek help

519
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,936
Go to oh my God. Info podcast

Black podcast

523
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,968
So a lot of other cities were also hit by fires in the mid-1800s

524
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
St.Louis

525
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:01,088
The 19th century was a very dangerous time in San Francisco for example in regards to fire

526
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,880
People came out for the gold rush

527
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,440
Lived wherever they could and would Shack

528
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,000
Pants even on wooden boats in the shallows of the Bay

529
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,048
It was a disaster waiting to happen

530
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
Agricola said he's here in studio with me now

531
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
It's not about how

532
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Fire

533
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,960
Shaped San Francisco's architecture and Amherst

534
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
In 1849

535
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,568
The same year that St Louis suffered from a severe fire that

536
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,360
Ultimately turned them toward Fireproof

537
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Brick

538
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,456
San Francisco was also hit by the first of a series of seven

539
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
And 2 years later

540
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,552
One of these destroyed an estimated 2000

541
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,368
Three-quarters of the city of the time

542
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
And Casino

543
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
The reason why there's a phoenix

544
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
It's because all these fires

545
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Fun facts

546
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,840
What are things that very clear

547
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:48,448
Is that serious, did not go the route of St Louis there are not a lot of brick buildings in response

548
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
The fires of the

549
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Bright 2

550
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:56,128
Brick was expensive on the bay and the climate doesn't really require the installation or benefit

551
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,408
From the thermal Mass

552
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
The brick provides

553
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,736
So why Lucy was actually rebuilt using wood

554
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
But they did widened

555
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
City streets to slow.

556
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
Spread of flames

557
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
And the funny therapy

558
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Firefighting

559
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
Jersey Evening Post

560
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,232
Range of fines for any citizen who stood by and didn't he

561
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Put out teacher

562
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
To make reservations

563
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,120
Regular citizen to be involuntary firefighter

564
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:22,240
I don't know if that would fly today but

565
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,520
And these fires

566
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,824
They also led to the creation of this Underground

567
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
Sister

568
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
System around the city

569
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,200
Which provided water reserves are firefighters so they could

570
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
Tap water

571
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
Closer to blaze

572
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
The importance of these

573
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,112
When actually realized until about a half century later

574
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
You mean for the Big Show

575
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
Quake of 1906

576
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
Exactly

577
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
Water mains broke

578
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,560
Rubble prevented firefighters from reaching parts of the city the fire is a burning for

579
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096
Thousand

580
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
Most of the City was destroyed

581
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,960
But in the aftermath San Francisco said about it

582
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,264
Expanding its auxiliary water supply

583
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,080
Reservoirs pump stations fire boats

584
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,872
Earthquake-proof cisterns

585
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
Using concrete and steel

586
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
All which were designed to help

587
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,248
In emergencies when conventional water system

588
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,832
Doesn't sound like a very good solution to but it doesn't sound like

589
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,368
Building with wood

590
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,976
Was a good idea

591
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,280
Masonry is better for fires but it's

592
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,072
Not as great an earthquake

593
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
All that being said

594
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
Did have a role to play

595
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,752
Walking around the city of the day you can spot where the CD cisterns are because they're marked out on the surface

596
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
With big circles of brick

597
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
On San Francisco streets

598
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,920
The brakes aren't actually part of the system but they do indicate where the sis

599
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
Western is

600
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,504
And visitors and new residents always ask about

601
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
Huge mystery what are those

602
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
Circle

603
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
Outlines

604
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
They are almost as big as

605
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
City Street

606
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,976
Yeah they spent basically from sidewalk to sidewalk

607
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,280
And they hit that something much larger below

608
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:53,376
Ultimately the visibility making these systems easier to spot in a crisis

609
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:57,216
In the middle of these break circles are these little manhole covers that provide the actual Acts

610
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,824
Being spun around the city these many reservoirs can function independently

611
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
Earthquake damage cuts off one area from another

612
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,480
And in total there about 170 of these spread around and they have

613
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
Combined capacity of

614
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,552
10 million gallon

615
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
Elias

616
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,904
And so if you're walking to see

617
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
You should really look for

618
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,048
Write an actually wrote an article titled the coating rings on our website which

619
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,584
Talk more about the history

620
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,888
Has images and videos but most importantly

621
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
Has a Mac

622
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,704
So you can actually help these down yourself

623
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
I'm nice and that website

Series from below radiotopia show the truth

660
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,576
That whines through a

661
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,624
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

662
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
We're looking the part

663
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,696
Might cost you your life

664
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:31,072
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

665
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:35,424
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

666
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,752
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

667
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
A dad

668
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,128
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

669
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,480
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

670
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,904
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

671
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,488
Was found dead in my private gym

672
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,560
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

673
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,840
Even worse

674
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,912
The cops think that I had something to do with it

675
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
Now

676
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,240
I need to clear my name

677
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
