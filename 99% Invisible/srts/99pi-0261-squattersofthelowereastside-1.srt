Roman Mars

22
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,192
3 years after moving to New York City

23
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,264
Maggie Wrigley found herself on the edge of homelessness

24
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
It was 1987

25
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,896
Cheater boyfriend at the time have been living in a warehouse in Brook

26
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,456
Their landlord was shady

27
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,480
And they didn't trust him

28
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
Weekly want going to stay and pay him all this money and you know you got kind of crazy and we didn't really know where we were going to go

29
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:35,744
Around that time they heard about an abandoned tenement building on the Lower East Side

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,536
Who is owned by the city

31
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
But it been left empty

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
And unmaintained

33
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,448
Friend told them a group of squatters had taken it over and started to fix it up

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,264
It was a place they could live without paying rent

35
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
And he said doesn't doesn't

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,128
If you want to come a prophet

37
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
Are you got to go through these meetings to get in they got to approve you it's pain in the ass we were like when we need a place to

38
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,600
So Wrigley and her boyfriend packed up their belongings

39
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,648
And drove their old car from Brooklyn

40
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
Into Manhattan

41
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
In fact the day that we drove

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Here

43
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
To move in out

44
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
Axle broke

45
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:15,168
On the cob just fell apart literally right outside the front door

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
So is like okay

47
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
We moved in

48
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,080
The building with the four-story structure

49
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
With mostly boarded-up windows

50
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
Mets producer Delaney Hall

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,504
Maggie and her boyfriend discovered that when their friends that the building was

52
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
Rough

53
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
He wasn't kill

54
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
The building was

55
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,904
Full of rubble some of the walls were rotten and falling down

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
It wasn't any running water

57
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,024
You got to open a hydrant with a wrench and then fill up these water buckets

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,816
Carry them back into the house and

59
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,840
It wasn't fun

60
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
And it was also winter time

61
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
When Wrigley moved

62
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,704
My dog's bowl

63
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:54,848
Would freeze my shampoo would freeze my everything would freeze in the house a toilet would freeze

64
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
It was like living in a refrigerator

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,344
It wasn't just the building that was falling down the hole Lower East Side which today is filled with expensive boutiques

66
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
Senayan condos

67
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672
Was struggling in the 1980s

68
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,000
It was pretty dire I mean it was it was it was a

69
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Broken

70
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,072
Brutal neighborhoods

71
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
So forget how

72
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
Astonishingly derelict

73
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,448
It was

74
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,544
There were empty lots filled with trash and falling down buildings everywhere

75
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,384
In fact Wrigley's building wasn't the only property in the neighborhood

76
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
That have been taken over by squatters

77
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
By the late 1980s

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,552
Squatters would come to occupy more than a dozen old cinnamon

79
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
On the Lower East Side

80
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
All the Misfits on the outcasts in the

81
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,488
The people that didn't have any other place to go could come here and make a community

82
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:48,352
And these Misfits and outcasts would eventually managed to do something kind of incredible

83
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,656
They resist eviction by the city

84
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
For almost two decades

85
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,312
Holding onto many of the buildings at the neighborhood around them rapidly gentrify

86
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,408
And as the properties grew more and more valuable and it's the city

87
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
Try harder and harder

88
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
To kick them out

89
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:14,464
Understand why there were so many abandoned buildings in New York City in the 1980s

90
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,280
You need to understand how a usable building

91
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Can become

92
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Economical

93
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Worthless

94
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,959
In the 1960s and 70s New York City began Halloween out

95
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,775
The city lost many of its manufacturing jobs

96
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,335
People with mean started moving to the

97
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
The suburbs

98
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
In many neighborhoods

99
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
Like the lower

100
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Decide

101
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,479
Property values started to slide

102
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
When landlords

103
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,087
Couldn't make a profit anymore by renting out

104
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,415
Their buildings in low-income neighborhoods

105
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
What's the low income tenants

106
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
They would start what's called milking them

107
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
This is dr. Amy starceski

108
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
2 minute apologist in an oral historian

109
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,935
And she's conducted dozens of interviews with the Lower East Side squatters

110
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
What's your here in the story

111
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,567
Francesca says that when landlords quote-unquote milk

112
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Stair building

113
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,663
They do all they could to extract maximum profit

114
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,063
So they were trying to continue to collect rents but increase their profits by not spending any money on the building

115
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
First they would stop

116
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
Providing services

117
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,183
Heat hot water stop making repairs

118
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
They would also stop paying taxes

119
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,047
The landlords would basically make a financial

120
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
Calculation

121
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:28,447
The money coming in from rents wasn't enough to cover the cost of a mortgage or property taxes

122
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,007
Some landlords would just walk away

123
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,335
They'd stop maintaining the building and stop paying the tax

124
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Zayo

125
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
When that happen

126
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,431
The city could take possession of the Builder

127
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
So a property values in New York City tank

128
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,391
And as more and more landlords walked away from their buildings

129
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,463
The city ended up owning tens of thousands of

130
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Properties

131
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
That were

132
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
In poor condition

133
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,911
Full of poor people and which had been taken care of properly for a long time

134
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,751
City government wasn't in a good position to take care of these buildings either

135
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
It was in the middle of an economic crisis

136
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
And the government had started cutting off services

137
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
The some parts of the city

138
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
It wasn't intentional strategy

139
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
They called it

140
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Planned

141
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Shrinkage

142
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
So what that meant in practice

143
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Was

144
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
Closing fire stations

145
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
I'm in poor neighborhoods

146
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
Withdrawing services

147
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,511
Not making repairs on public infrastructure

148
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,839
Enso neighborhoods like the Lower East Side like the South Bronx

149
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
Ended up largely depopulated

150
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
And just full of

151
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Abandoned

152
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
Stem and burned-out buildings and vacant Lots

153
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
All of which men

154
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,711
Terrible housing conditions for the people that remained and lots of opportunities for squatter

155
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
Freedom of squatting also meant that

156
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Got

157
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
For sort of already

158
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
Rollin and Tumblin

159
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
To American Life

160
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,255
In some way or another

161
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:01,375
Peterson YOLO is a poet who moved into one of the Lower East Side squats in 1988

162
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,191
The building he lived in was filled with artists

163
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
Punks transients activist

164
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,263
In this place logo

165
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,383
There were also a fair number of squatters with mental health issues and addiction problem

166
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,735
People who weren't able to hold them regular jobs or make monthly rent

167
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
For one reason or another

168
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
Hard to tell the difference between

169
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,439
Person actually a psychotic on their own or or are they

170
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
A little eccentric

171
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
Pissing in a bucket for five years

172
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
Have no windows on the

173
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
January

174
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,167
New York the squatters said about fixing up their decrepit buildings

175
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Clearing Rubble

176
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,519
Building stairs reinforcing walls and replacing windows

177
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,359
They illegally tapped into the city's electric bread and water cyst

178
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Everybody works

179
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,431
Together Maggie Wrigley

180
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
I mean I built this house

181
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,599
I raised my floors in Ohio I wired electrical

182
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,927
People built out their spaces in highly personalized ways

183
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,023
One guy's apartment was furnished with cabinets Salvage from an old Pan Am airplane

184
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,839
One apartment was done all in shades of purple

185
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
Purple stained oak floors

186
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,959
Adult big open spaces for art galleries in puncture

187
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
For a lot of people it was thrilling

188
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,079
To live in a place that allowed for so much freedom

189
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,199
How many of the squatters saw themselves as a

190
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
For cheap or free housing

191
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,807
In the neighborhood that was plagued by homeless

192
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
You saw it everywhere you went and

193
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Did every neighborhood

194
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
Especially true

195
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
On the Lower East Side

196
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
In the neighbor

197
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Easter pocket square

198
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:40,959
Spagnola and some of his friends would make brochures and go hand them out to homeless people in Tompkins Square Park

199
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
And the pressure was basically like

200
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
You don't have to live like this

201
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
Within two or three blocks

202
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
To this park

203
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
AR

204
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
Dozens and dozens of abandoned building

205
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
Get together with your other

206
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
Folks were living like you are

207
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
And

208
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Go take a building

209
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,391
From the early to mid eighties the squatters didn't face much active reserve

210
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Distance from the sea

211
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,999
From time to time City officials would come by and brick

212
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
Their windows and doors

213
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
But the squatters would just

214
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
Smash through the brick

215
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,143
I frankly thought that

216
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,703
As long as the economy of New York remain

217
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
If you're dodging

218
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
We would be less than

219
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
Economic Cycles

220
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
Started to go back

221
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
Into a cycle of investment

222
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
Reinvestment

223
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
I figured we were proud

224
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,903
When the squatters took over the buildings on the Lower East

225
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,231
I'd they were tapping into a long American tradition

226
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,071
Of laying claim to land by occupying and develop

227
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,703
In 1862 the federal government was trying to encourage Westward Expansion and settlement

228
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,007
And so Congress passed the Homestead Act

229
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,335
It opened up millions of acres of land in the American West

230
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
The settlers

231
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,919
If the settlers farmed the land and improved it

232
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,759
Then after five years they could file for a deed from the government

233
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,551
And take legal ownership

234
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
At least

235
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
Legal in the eyes of the US government

236
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,975
Not necessarily the native peoples who lived on the land for thousands of years

237
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,607
By the 1960s and 70s the idea of urban homesteading had taken hold in cities

238
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,703
Local governments would offer cheap or free houses to low-income residents

239
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,031
Provided they worked on the buildings and brought them up to code

240
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
This was known as

241
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Sweat Equity

242
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,175
And some of the squatters in New York basically saw themselves

243
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Does providing

244
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
Even if it wasn't under any officially things

245
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
Program

246
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Many squatters

247
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
May have lived outside the mainstream

248
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
But in some ways they were

249
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,487
Tapping into mainstream American values

250
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
They go way back

251
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
Values of self

252
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:47,423
Sufficiency entrepreneurialism pulling yourself up by your bootstraps

253
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,543
Individual responsibility and so squatting fits in with that Story 2

254
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,103
But the city government didn't necessarily see it that

255
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:01,759
And as time went on the squatters Renegade methods would draw more critical attention in a city that was run

256
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Gentrify

257
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,879
By the late 1980s New York City

258
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,951
Turn the corner and was gradually starting to come out of a long a

259
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Economic slump

260
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:16,095
People were moving back into the city real estate prices were once again starting to

261
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
The Climb

262
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,679
And the city was beginning to reinvest in neighborhoods

263
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
Dad long neglect

264
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,287
The issues of homelessness and housing on the lower

265
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
Seaside or becoming more and more

266
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
Squatters and homeless

267
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
Felt like they had to fight

268
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
To hang on to whatever space

269
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,807
Clean try to kick the homeless out

270
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:43,487
Because if you do you got a wart on your head a lot of attention focused on

271
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
Square Park

272
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
Lower East Side

273
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
The park was closed too many of the squats and was the place where spend YOLO have passed out his Pro squatting pamphlets

274
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Homeless people

275
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,031
In the summer of 1988 the New York parks

276
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
Department implemented a 1 a.m.

277
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
Curfew at the park

278
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,687
They were helping to reduce the number of people living and sleeping there

279
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,991
The curfew sparked protests

280
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
Which turned into a riot

281
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,599
Many squatters were part of the altercation

282
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,399
Photographers being pushed by police

283
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,031
Tompkins Square Park riots were a turning point in the relationship between

284
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
Squatters and the City

285
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,895
That brought a lot of attentions around gentle

286
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
Application on displacement and

287
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
Class

288
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
In the neighborhood

289
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
To a head

290
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,855
More than ever the city wanted the squatters out of the neighborhood

291
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,439
Local politicians and even some other affordable housing act

292
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,023
Accused of squatters of not playing by the rules

293
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,631
Occupying buildings that were badly needed by other low-income residents

294
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
Who had deeper roots in the neighbor

295
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,543
Hundreds and hundreds of alpacas living doubled up tripled up and sometimes quadruple.

296
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
And substandard housing

297
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Wally's

298
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
Yelp squatters

299
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
Art

300
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
Stealing from the poor

301
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,479
Alan Renton tax-free

302
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:15,135
This is an old interview from WNYC of a controversial city counselor named Antonio Pagan who represent

303
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,463
In the Lower East Side he was a housing developer turned politician

304
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,047
And he emerges a particularly Fierce critic of this Waters

305
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,143
Understanding The Way of the development of our community by the community

306
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
As criticism mounted

307
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
The city began working harder to evict

308
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
The squatters

309
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,359
Response the squatters began devising creative ways to resist

310
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
Sears weekly ad

311
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,063
We had we had barricades in the house man that was the mentality that we were living with you know we always had fun

312
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,903
But anyone in the house and white Speedy no fire and no content

313
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,487
That was one of things that came out of that. Was it

314
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Realself

315
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Statement

316
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,095
When the police did show up

317
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,423
The squatters have developed a plan for how to quickly mobilize

318
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,959
The eviction law

319
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
Eviction watch was a the organization of

320
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
Squatters throughout the neighbor

321
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Here's Peter Espanol

322
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:13,759
And having your name on this telephone tree meant that in the event you were call you would come to a squat

323
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
2

324
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
Utica mm

325
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:21,695
Squatters would physically block police from entering the building they link arms and stand in front of the door

326
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,999
Sometimes the defend the building from the inside

327
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,815
Throwing paint in garbage down on the police

328
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
Or buckets of urine

329
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,655
Sometimes they hide inside

330
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,959
Does it cops couldn't clear the building

331
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
They would have little secret

332
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
Compartments and hiding places to go in

333
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:42,687
Physically occupying the building was always the best strategy the city was always very

334
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,247
Quick and eager to demolish a squad

335
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,319
But they couldn't imagine us a squad with people inside

336
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
At least four things down

337
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
Squatters weren't just fighting the city in the streets

338
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
They also began devising a legal strategy

339
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,887
We had developed among ourselves the idea of adverse possession

340
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
It's illegal Theory

341
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
It's something you can use

342
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
Squatters

343
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
Love adverse possession law

344
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
The details of the law vary state by state

345
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,919
New York it says that if you occupy a piece of property for 10 years

346
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,735
And the legal owner doesn't Force you out

347
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
You can claim the legal title

348
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
Address for the ocean is an interesting law

349
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
Because it's

350
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
Seems to

351
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,439
Destabilize some of the things that we

352
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
Say that we value about private property

353
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,095
And ownership namely that if you own a property you have a right to it

354
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
And it's yours

355
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Forever

356
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,727
Adverse possession means owners have certain responsibilities

357
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
2

358
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,079
If you abandon your property and leave it unused for long periods

359
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
You risk losing it

360
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:48,223
To successfully claim adverse possession the squatters would need to meet a number of conditions

361
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,295
Like proving that lived in the building's continuous

362
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
For example

363
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,415
Some of the squatters were wary about getting tangled up with the legal system

364
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,975
But others saw it as their chance to gain ownership

365
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,791
They hired a lawyer and started putting together a case

366
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,631
The judge who had their claim found they were likely to make a successful case

367
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Against the city

368
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,983
And he granted them an injunction against eviction

369
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,775
Until the case was decided

370
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,871
But before the case could be settled in court and in spite of the injunction

371
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,943
The city evicted the residents of two of the building

372
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,271
City inspectors said that they were in danger of collapse

373
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,343
Here's Mary Neville a spokeswoman for the housing

374
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
Xiamen archival interview

375
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:32,767
The occupants of the five city-owned buildings on East 13th Street are squatters and whether they've been there for

376
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:37,887
For 5 minutes 5 years or 15 years the fact of the matter is they broke into

377
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,239
Vacant city-owned buildings that were sealed

378
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,407
These evictions provoke the biggest Showdown yet between the city and the squatters

379
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,455
In May of 1995

380
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,343
Everybody was on the edge and everybody was on the look at

381
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
And I remember someone

382
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
Called me one night and they

383
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
I said okay this

384
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Dislike

385
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
100 dry cough

386
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
Have arrived

387
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,887
And they're like four blocks away and then the number grew

388
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
They was sending in

389
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,703
Basically small Nami

390
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,543
The police have brought a tank repurposed from the Korean War

391
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,127
Officer took up positions on the roofs of neighboring buildings

392
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Meanwhile

393
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,711
Squatters Patrol the neighborhood walkie talkies

394
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,015
Reporting on the growing numbers of police

395
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:31,903
They welded bicycle frames to their fire escape so it would be impossible for police or firefighters to climb them

396
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,975
Big factor staircases with rubble to make them impossible

397
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,839
Bayport are on the street so police would have to March through it on their way to the building

398
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
And you know again you know

399
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Creative

400
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,215
Responses you know Chinese off to the building

401
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,519
Use your piss bucket and nobody's going to

402
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,079
Nobody's going to try and come get you know it's like

403
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
It was busy

404
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
Is vile but it's

405
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
What the hell you know

406
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
You got guns we got this bucket

407
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
The police presence one on for month

408
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
Seelbach the ends of the block

409
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,391
I'm required people to show ID before they let them through

410
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,951
Don't the squatters wouldn't leave

411
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:12,863
Expense and inconvenience and embarrassment to eventually decide that

412
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,191
That this wasn't the way to go and they're going to have to find some other way to deal with this

413
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
Squatters Everlasting

414
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,079
Rudy Giuliani was the mayor of the setting at the time

415
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,383
And he was a vocal critic of the squatters

416
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:30,527
But astonishingly in 1999 a secret negotiation between the city and the squatters started to unfold

417
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
They began to discuss

418
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
What it once seemed

419
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
Legalization

420
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,183
I remember being surprised

421
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,975
By the fact that we were going to have this

422
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Discussion

423
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
And

424
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,119
Giuliani Administration which just made it weirder and weirder and it was it was

425
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
Just hard to fathom

426
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
A new plan started to develop

427
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
Separate from the adverse

428
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
Possession case

429
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,823
The city would sell the squatters buildings to 1/3

430
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,895
A nonprofit organization called do you have

431
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
The urban homesteading

432
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,087
Since the 1970s you haven't been helping low-income New Yorkers gain ownership

433
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Distressed

434
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:11,999
You have would then turn the buildings over to the squatters and help them get loans so they could bring the buildings up

435
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
The code

436
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,095
After years of negotiation the deal went through

437
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
In 2002

438
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,703
The city sold 11 buildings to you have

439
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,495
For $1

440
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,847
And you have began working with the squatters to turn their buildings

441
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
From squats

442
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
Until we go cooperatively owned apartment

443
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,783
The process wasn't easy and it raised some hard questions in the squad

444
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
One thing

445
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
There was the issue of resale

446
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,183
Mini squatters were committed to keeping the building's affordable

447
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,511
They wanted to cap the resale price on each apartment

448
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,351
So that people couldn't flip their units for massive sums of money

449
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:54,751
But there were others who felt like they'd invested so much time and energy into the buildings that they wanted to be able to cash

450
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
There was a bunch of people

451
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,871
Basically the line was

452
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:06,527
Well if we're not going to be Atticus anymore we might as well be capitalized

453
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,695
Are the squatters rehabs the buildings and brought them up to code

454
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,279
Some of the more unique and handle elements of people's Apartments

455
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
Had to go

456
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
Some of the buildings became last Wild

457
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
More uniform

458
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
Pure handmade mosaic

459
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,471
More boring drywall

460
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,055
A few of the buildings haven't managed to get through the legalization process

461
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,847
Even 15 years later

462
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
There have been hard trade-off

463
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,967
Some squatters didn't want to take on debt for the building

464
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
And they've moved out

465
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,319
But for many like Maggie Wrigley

466
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,159
The legalization has been a victory for affordable housing

467
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,231
One of the most expensive cities in the country

468
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,535
And it's offered a kind of stability

469
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,095
At the end of nearly two decades of drama

470
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,959
Wework used by everything you don't speculation trying to steal these buildings

471
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Racketeering

472
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,799
And that's the beautiful thing about where we are today

473
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,103
It will all these feelings will always be affordable

474
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:08,479
Maggie's building was the first to finish the legalization process in 2009

475
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,783
It's still full of artist and activist

476
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,367
Mini the people who live there have been there for years

477
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
In ears

478
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
People are starting to have kids

479
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
Start family

480
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,280
There's not that sense of constant threat

481
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
If you're there

482
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
Police might come by and break up

483
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
All their windows

484
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
Maggie's not a squatter anymore

485
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
She's something else

486
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
I am a homeowner

487
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
And it's incredible

488
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,104
And you know it's long as we keep our act together

489
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
Then nobody can put us out

490
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,784
You know and that's it we we got it you know we can tell it's help building his house to lose

Bongs and Charter of our devices

523
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,848
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

524
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:50,272
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

To make them more human

530

Turn the living room lights on

531
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
Okay

532
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,592

536
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,368
Makes for a much more natural experience

537
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
Turn the living room lights on
