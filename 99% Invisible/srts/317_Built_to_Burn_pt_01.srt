I'm Roman Mars

31
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
For the past few days Californians have watched as the car Wildfire has raged through the northern part of the state

32
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,584
The fire started a little more than a week ago

33
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,376
Fueled by dry brush

34
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,448
High temperatures and strong shifting winds

35
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,520
The fire has moved from a national Recreation Area

36
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
Into the nearby city of Redding

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
As of this recording six people have died 19 people are reported missing in thousands have a key

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,296
He waited the fire is only 20% contained

39
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,368
Wildland fires aren't new in California

40
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,000
But with climate change are fire seasons are becoming longer and fires are becoming bigger

41
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
And harder to fight

42
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,120
So the next two weeks we're going to look at the issue of wildfire

43
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
Some design Solutions

44
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,472
Just how complicated they can be to implement

45
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,808
The Santa Ana winds of Southern California are sometimes called the devil winds

46
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,624
They pick up in the late summer and early fall

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Sweeping down from the mountains and across the coast are hot dry and known for creating

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
Dangerous fire conditions

49
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:48,960
In late November of 1980 as the Santa anas blue in it up to 90 miles an hour

50
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,544
Unknown arsonist with a fire near Panorama point

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
San Bernardino Mountain

52
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,128
Mets reporter Stephanie Joyce

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
Pushed by the wind the fire grew and quickly spread down the mountain towards the city of San Bernardino

54
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,088
Elizabeth city's been fired

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,744
Talking to a reporter and we had extremely strong winds humidity was somewhere

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
About 10

57
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,120
Another local fire chief said they called in all available resource

58
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
And still

59
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
It wasn't enough

60
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
There was no stopping the fire

61
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,520
All the conditions were

62
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
Just wright

63
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
+ 4

64
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,664
What we commonly refer to as a firestorm

65
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480
In just a few hours

66
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,552
Panorama fire destroyed hundreds of homes

67
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
Killed 4 people

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,440
Was one of the worst Wildfire disasters in California history

69
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
The time

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,536
It was also the fire that would make a young researcher

71
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,096
Question or entire approach to wildfires

72
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
And conclude

73
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,216
That we might be able to design our way out of the devastation

74
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Because

75
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
When was a few years out of graduate school

76
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,664
In a recent transplant to California

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
Time of the fire

78
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
He's working as a research scientist with a

79
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
The forest server

80
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,808
Studying fire Behavior

81
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,416
He was interested in how to Panorama fire and destroyed so many homes

82
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,000
Especially when there was such an overwhelming firefighting response

83
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:21,887
A Strike Team of entrances five engines and they had 20 strike teams coming in

84
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Right away

85
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,055
There would be a whole block of houses on fire and they could not deliver enough water

86
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
So they were calling in

87
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,639
More hoses

88
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
And moving

89
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
A block down

90
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
42 block

91
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
Box down and losing that

92
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
And then moving

93
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Further

94
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
And losing that

95
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,951
Two Jacks are listening to the emergency dispatch

96
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
Tapes from the day of the fire

97
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
Jack is a matter-of-fact kind of guy

98
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Assignment

99
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Rational

100
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
Not emotional

101
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,311
Almost 40 years later he's still chokes up when he talks about the desperation he heard in the firefighters voice

102
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,383
The teams are pretty hard to understand

103
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,431
But you can hear the emotion

104
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
It was pretty emotional

105
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
Particularly listening

106
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
The radio traffic

107
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
Just couldn't

108
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
He couldn't fight it

109
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,807
For those of us who mostly say wildfires on TV or in pictures of the paper

110
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,159
It's easy to imagine that a wildfire is like a tsunami of flames

111
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,255
Spreading across the landscape and destroying everything in its path

112
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,815
But Jack knew it wasn't that simple

113
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,399
Piece together how the disaster had unfolded

114
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,983
And so one of the things that I did was to look at

115
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
When the first

116
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:09,151
Call Kami on to dispatch for a fire in this community

117
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,223
Where was that call from

118
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
And where was the Wildfire at that time

119
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
Just get out of here

120
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
Just get out

121
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
Is Jack was listening to the tape

122
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
He started to notice a pattern

123
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
People were calling in about houses on fire

124
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
Long before

125
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,527
The fire front ever reach their neighborhoods

126
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
The Wildfire was

127
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,903
Still actually on the other side of the ridge

128
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,231
About a half a mile away burning up the hill

129
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,303
These houses were burning because of wall of Fire

130
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Was racing through the community

131
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,143
They were burning because of something else

132
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
The Embers

133
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
As wildfires burn they generate Ember

134
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,079
Better lofted downwind ahead of the main body of a fire

135
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,663
Jack realized most of the houses that burned had one

136
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
Extremely problematic feature in common

137
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,063
As it turns out every house had a flammable Woodroof

138
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,927
The Embers were accumulating in the crevices around the dry wood shingles

139
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
Setting fire to the houses from above

140
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,815
Across the street in a development without wood roofs

141
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,607
Most of the houses that survived

142
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,679
And while that might not seem like a huge epiphany

143
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,775
That houses with wood roofs burned and houses without wood roofs didn't

144
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
For Jack

145
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:45,663
It was that detail that made him rethink the entire Wildfire problem

146
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,503
Because when you listen to other people talk about the fire

147
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
They weren't focusing on the wood roof

148
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,367
They were talking about firefighting

149
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,671
They were saying nothing could have been done

150
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
I just captain in the San Bernardino fire department

151
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,559
If we would have had as many as 500 units

152
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,631
Read along the whole Hillside there to protect those homes

153
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,983
I don't believe that we could have stopped that fire any better than we did on his condition

154
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
WeChat

155
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:15,615
The only thing that I feel is that what could have saved those homes

156
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
Would have only been an act of God

157
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,295
Jack didn't think that was right the problem wasn't the firefighting response

158
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
The problem was that the houses

159
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
What are built

160
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
To burn

161
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
And when Jack shifted his Focus

162
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
The fire to the design of the home

163
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,399
Suddenly he found himself wondering if we were framing the whole problem of wildfire in the wrong way

164
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
He wasn't the first to have that thought

165
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
But he was the first

166
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
To do extensive research

167
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
Exactly

168
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
How homes burned in wildfires

169
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:52,223
Some of that work put him at odds with some of the main firefighting agencies in the US

170
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,063
And nearly a hundred years of fire policy in Tradition

171
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,135
And even though his ideas are simple and compelling

172
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,951
They still haven't caught on in the way that he hoped they would

173
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:07,839
Maybe because fighting fires is as much a social and political problem as it is a technical one

174
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,191
Do you feel frustrated most of the time

175
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:19,103
For most of this country's history or approach to Wildfire has been driven by the sentiment

176
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
Fire is bad

177
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
Before colonization Native American tribe set fires intentionally to regenerate while playing

178
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,879
How to create grassland habitat for game

179
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,743
When Europeans arrived they brought fear of fire with them

180
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:42,143
And overtime in much of the country not only did we do away with the practice of setting fires we actually

181
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,471
He started to extinguish naturally-occurring fires to

182
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:51,359
In 1911 that became an official responsibilities of the newly-created for a service

183
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,943
Even got a name

184
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
The 10 a.m.

185
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
Is it the forest service

186
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,879
To put out every new fire on public land by 10 a.m. the following day

187
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
President Roosevelt

188
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,743
Civilian Conservation Corps was on the front lines of implementing

189
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
That policy

190
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,583
We fought those fire night and day sometime

191
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
You can see smoke

192
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
Clear the end of the world

193
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
The belief was that with enough water and Manpower

194
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,639
Firefighters could put out any wildfire

195
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,711
And a huge industry rose up around that idea

196
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,527
Agreed to employ tens of thousands of people

197
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:36,415
With hundreds of millions of dollars a year being spent on planes and helicopters and fire Crews

198
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,767
And for a while that Brute Force approach seem to work

199
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,095
What does early firefighters had an advantage

200
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
For millennia

201
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,935
Before the rise of modern fire suppression

202
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
Woodburn regularly

203
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
America

204
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
S4s

205
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,823
They would eat up all the fuel

206
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,895
Thyroxine low-intensity

207
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,687
Estate on the forest floor

208
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,015
As firefighters begin aggressively fighting fires

209
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
That balance started to change

210
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
With fewer fires burning

211
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
For it started getting more and more dance

212
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
On the forest

213
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
Did catch on fire

214
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,303
There's more material to burn in a fire burn hotter

215
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
And bigger

216
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
If I delete by suppressing natural fires

217
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,215
We created something that turned out to be much much worse

218
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
Here's Mark Finney

219
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,311
He's a fire scientist with the forest service

220
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
Fighting fire really has some

221
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,151
Unintended consequences

222
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,199
Or maybe even worse than the fire so

223
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
In Oxnard

224
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,343
Since the very beginnings of our fire suppression policies

225
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,951
There been people arguing that it wasn't a good idea to put out every fire

226
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
But it took until the 1980s for that idea to really take hold

227
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,607
By then it was also becoming increasingly clear

228
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
That we couldn't put out every fire

229
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,215
Especially as they got bigger and bigger

230
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,799
We're not actually stopping them we're just delaying them

231
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
Yeah there's a

232
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
The saying a fire put out as a fire put off

233
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,015
But even as the public in the 1980s started to accept the idea that

234
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,575
Fire was natural and necessary

235
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
And fighting it had unintended consequences

236
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Not fighting it

237
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,719
Didn't seem like a viable option

238
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
Outside of remote Wilderness Area

239
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
Because how could you stop

240
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Fighting fires

241
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
When they threatened

242
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
Which brings us back to Jack Cohen

243
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
The panorama fire

244
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,823
Once he started to focus on the home at the problem not the wildfire

245
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,175
He wanted to know what made some houses more susceptible than others

246
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
This was a question that I had in my mind a curiosity question what I'm trying to do is to ask

247
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,415
Establish a relationship between wildfire and Hondas

248
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
I want to know what that linkage is

249
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,791
How does this happen

250
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
In the Panorama fire

251
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,983
It had clearly been the wood roofs but in other fires there were plenty of homes without wood roofs

252
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Hepburn 2

253
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,103
So Jack said about learning all of the houses potential weaknesses

254
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,431
All the ways it might possibly catch on fire

255
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,247
The first thing he wanted to know was how close the

256
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
Flames of the Wildfire had to be to a house

257
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
Frederick Knight simply from the radiant heat

258
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,439
Answer that question he did a series of experiments

259
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,023
Including one in the late 1990s in Northern Canada

260
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
Reset an actual Forest

261
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Text on fire

262
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
Do you actually cut

263
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Slots

264
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
M2

265
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Affordable realtor

266
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
And then

267
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
Japan on fire

268
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Yes

269
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
Glastonbury

270
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Yes

271
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
What Jack found in the experiment

272
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
Was it an entire Forest

273
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
Could be on fire

274
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
30 feet away from the house

275
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
And nothing

276
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
It was fine

277
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,719
But of course Jack news at the flames and the radiant heat weren't the only threats to the house

278
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
There were also the Embers

279
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,863
He frequently found himself standing next to houses reduced to Ash

280
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
And next to them

281
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
Green trees

282
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,519
It was a Telltale sign the fire front never even reached the home

283
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
But the Embers did

284
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,663
Jack has a slideshow he likes to share with photos of burned houses

285
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,967
So this isn't going to be free audio

286
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
And it's like the optical illusion

287
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
The phase in the phases

288
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
At first

289
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,671
You look at the aftermath of a wildfire

290
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
And all you see is the

291
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Destruction

292
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:28,351
But after a few slide almost feel the transition in your

293
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
In your eyes

294
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,935
I'm like the green trees shift into Focus

295
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
It's easy to see that the home

296
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,031
Is often the only thing that's burnt

297
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
When you when you see it

298
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
It's like a miracle you're like oh wow

299
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
So

300
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
One of the things that I always

301
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
Try to point out because

302
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
Everybody

303
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,367
That looks at news footage and pictures

304
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
Can readily observe

305
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
No trees on fire

306
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
And the structure burning

307
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
So he did experiment

308
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
To see exactly how the Ember

309
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
Setting houses on fire

310
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,727
He discovered Embers like to collect in lots of

311
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
Places

312
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,543
Like in the corners of wood

313
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
Gutters

314
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,359
Pine needles in an attic

315
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Open phone

316
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:18,015
People evacuate during Wildfire there's no one around to douse The Embers

317
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,087
A smolder and set fire to the entire house

318
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
The more I thought about it

319
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,951
The more he came to believe the most Ember fires

320
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,767
To be stopped with some simple design solution

321
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
I mean you don't have to live in a bunker you don't have to

322
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
Cut all your trees down

323
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,287
Jack began to develop guidelines for Designing and Landscaping homes to withstand wildfire

324
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,919
He started by drawing a buffer based on a conservative interpretation of those Canadian fire experiment

325
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
He called it

326
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,735
Home ignition Zone

327
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:54,111
The home ignition zone is limited to the house and its immediate surroundings out to about a hundred feet

328
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,695
Between 150 and 30 seats in the House

329
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
The goal is to space

330
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,279
Trees to the fire can't jump between them

331
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
Has forced the ground

332
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,887
Between 30 feet and 5 feet

333
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,983
What was the landscape and design to the ground fire loses Steam

334
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
Removing fuels like tall grasses

335
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Woodpile

336
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
Within five feet of the house

337
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
The going to stop

338
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
Fire dead in its tracks

339
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
With things like rock that

340
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
Well irrigated grass

341
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,855
What I found is that you don't have to be very exotic

342
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,439
About your design and materials in order to make your

343
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,023
The house is very resistant to ignition

344
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:38,655
Jack also came up with a long list of suggestions for preventing Ember fires on the house itself

345
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,495
From the big and obvious ones like replacing your flammable Woodroof

346
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
To the smaller less obvious

347
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
Like making sure your garage door has a

348
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
Tight Seal with a concrete

349
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
And removing decorative juniper trees

350
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
Which RX

351
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
Some of these ideas were pretty intuitive

352
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,343
I've been floating around for a long time

353
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,183
Many fire-prone communities homeowners have long been encouraged

354
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,743
The clear flammable vegetation in their properties

355
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,047
Send to maintain their homes in ways that would reduce

356
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Stir chances

357
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Catching Fire

358
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,423
Ajax experiments allowed him to put hard numbers

359
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
The people's intuition

360
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
Develop specific

361
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,799
Evidence based recommendations

362
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
For the changes homeowners should make

363
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,895
In Jack's experiment also showed

364
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
The windows changes were made

365
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,991
House was much less likely to burn

366
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,551
In fact he showed that was the meantime

367
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
Factor in whether a house was going to burn

368
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,671
It wasn't about the intensity of the fire or its size

369
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,511
It was really about what was happening within 100 feet of your home

370
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,815
And not let him to a further

371
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
Far more radical

372
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,447
You can have extreme Wildfire Behavior

373
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
Not control that

374
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,799
And yet still have houses

375
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
Survive

376
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:55,967
In other words we may not even need to fight fires as long as buildings near fire-prone areas

377
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,759
Are designed to withstand them

378
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
It wasn't that there weren't

379
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Other reason

380
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
Just like fire

381
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,255
But Jack said there was no need to fight a fire

382
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
Is the only goal was to save houses

383
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,631
Not ruled out fighting a lot of force

384
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,471
So we have the opportunity to separate

385
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,823
The Wildfire issues from the home destruction issues

386
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
We can separate those

387
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,943
Which meant we could let more forest fires burn naturally

388
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:32,319
And finally break out of the Vicious Cycle of fire suppression that leads to the largest inferno's

389
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,743
Jack thought that he'd come up with a way to save houses

390
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
And let fires burn natural

391
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,583
He thought it was a win-win

392
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,191
1999 he presented a paper about his findings at a fire comprar

393
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
Events in San Diego

394
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
So I give this paper in front of a group of mostly agency people people with the forest service and

395
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
State Fire agencies

396
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,735
People in a position to change policy

397
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
And Jack says

398
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
They are.

399
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
Totally uninterested

400
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
Like no Quest

401
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:10,975
Jack is up there saying that it's really only what happens within a hundred feet of a home

402
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
It determines whether it burns

403
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
And no one seems to care

404
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
Except this one guy

405
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Environmental Group

406
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,959
As I'm walking out he says

407
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,007
Do you have a copy of that paper

408
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
Ajax like

409
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Sure

410
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Here's a copy

411
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,639
A few days later a newspaper reporter calls

412
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
Asking about Jack

413
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Talk

414
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,759
Check is an interview and the article comes out in a local

415
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
Wallpaper

416
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
And I don't

417
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,599
Exactly remember the headline

418
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
But it was something like

419
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Poor service has its head up

420
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
Pataas

421
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,023
That wasn't the actual title of the article

422
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,399
But the story did imply that basically everything about how the forest service dealt with wildfires

423
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
What's wrong

424
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,799
Because remember the 10 a.m. rural had left us with this huge firefighting infrastructure

425
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:02,175
The forest service was spending hundreds of millions of dollars on planes and fire Crews

426
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,479
Was approving massive logging projects

427
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,319
Next on the grounds of thinning out the forest would help reduce the intensity

428
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,623
Wildfires in safe homes

429
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:17,279
And Jack was saying actually it would be way more effective if you just encouraged homeowners

430
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:22,655
Maintain retrofit their properties 9 in the morning I get a phone call

431
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
From

432
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
Region 6

433
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
Forest Service

434
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,823
The fire director of region 6

435
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
What do you think you're doing

436
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,175
Immediately

437
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
He was in trouble

438
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,759
He remembers the conversation

439
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,343
The director told Jack he was putting those big logging projects

440
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
In jeopardy

441
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
And not put the director in a sticky

442
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Keep political

443
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,535
But in the middle of getting chewed out by the director Jack just

444
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
Double down he says

445
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,863
He knew what the data said

446
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,911
He knew the signs wasn't wrong

447
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,263
And he told the director of the logging projects weren't going to do much to save home

448
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
And I said well

449
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
You might have a problem

450
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,967
Because the research I've done

451
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,319
Doesn't indicate that that's going to be very effective

452
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,391
That was the end of the phone call

453
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
And pretty much

454
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
The beginning of

455
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
Adversity

456
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
For the next

457
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,656
Three or four years at least

458
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,872
I don't know I wasn't at a level to know whether was resistant

459
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
This is Shawna legarza

460
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,504
She currently the national director of fire and Aviation management

461
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
Forest Service

462
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,856
Jack was first promoting his ideas

463
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
She wasn't in manager

464
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,696
So she wouldn't comment on the pushback

465
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
The Jack says he

466
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
Effaced

467
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,072
She does say that over her 30-year career in the forest service

468
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:59,680
She's seen more and more emphasis placed on strategies like defensible space

469
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,496
Which means clearing your property of flammable materials

470
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
And she's happy

471
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,848
I believe that people taking my ownership

472
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:13,248
And their home and have a defensible spaces is number one service can do to encourage

473
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,528
Rich people to make changes

474
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,624
A lot of that work falls on local governments and individual homeowners

475
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
And even today

476
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:25,536
Not everyone is convinced that it's important to invest in the kinds of preparations that Jack recommends

477
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
Yeah you know so it's

478
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:32,448
It's kind of scattered across the country, communities don't believe a fire will ever happen

479
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,752
Weather out it'll never happen to me

480
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:39,616
And I'll never have to evacuate and so I went to keep my trees and shrubs right by my house and

481
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,456
Unfortunately time is telling us or showing us that it does happen

482
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,528
Fire has no boundaries and no preference for

483
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
Aware burn

484
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,112
And in the meantime the forest service

485
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,952
As a congressionally-mandated duty to fight fires

486
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,816
Last year the federal government spent more than two billion dollars fighting fires

487
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,400
Just a small fraction of that prevention and mitigation

488
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Deference

489
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,728
Parkour culture views fire

490
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,544
Has primarily an emergency response activity

491
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:15,200
But if you treat fire only is an emergency response under emergency circumstances you're missing out on all the preventive

492
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,272
This is Mark Finney again

493
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
You remember he also works

494
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
For the forest service

495
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,904
He was on board with Jack's ideas

496
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,720
He also understood that there were huge challenges

497
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Implement

498
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,560
The reasons why they didn't catch on

499
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,400
First we can't just throw a bunch of scientific papers on the table and

500
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,960
Have everybody reason to go out cheese thanks

501
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,776
That's what I needed now we have a different

502
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,312
View of how things work

503
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:50,016
There's too much history behind the idea that we've got to do something about fire

504
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,832
Whether it's effective or not we the public

505
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,928
Expect to see dramatic shots of airplanes flying over raging fires

506
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
Dropping water on them

507
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,024
But when communities put

508
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,328
Principles Jack articulated into practice

509
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
They work

510
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:09,728
There are several communities in Southern California built with wildfires in mind

511
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,776
That survived when nearby homes

512
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
Didn't

513
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
But those homes are mostly

514
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
Free Custom Design

515
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,384
Gated communities

516
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
Homeowners association

517
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,504
7/4 strict rules about vegetation

518
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
Home design

519
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,112
Making changes elsewhere is more complicated

520
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,696
For starters many homeowners may not even have

521
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
Space

522
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
To clear and Fireproof

523
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,304
It's expensive to replace your roof

524
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,864
Renters they may not have the authority to

525
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
Make changes to

526
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,400
Their homes

527
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,936
Remaining cases

528
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
There aren't incentives

529
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
For people to invest

530
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,824
Plus many homeowners just kind of instinctively get

531
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,408
Got the odds of being in a wildfire or extremely low

532
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,504
There are more than 40 million homes in wildfire-prone areas

533
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,064
And only a few thousand burn every year

534
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,624
Without someone compelling them to do it

535
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,976
Homeowners might decide is just not worth spending time and money

536
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
To change their properties

537
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,560
So even though Jack's ideas are

538
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
Pretty simple

539
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,400
They're not simple to actually implement

540
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,424
In the real world

541
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
DuckTales

542
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,984
The story about a friend of his

543
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,056
Descended modifying homes to make them fire

544
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,336
Assistant isn't Rock

545
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,408
And I said to him know this

546
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,480
Is much harder this is social science

547
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,832
And his comment is

548
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
OG's we're screwed

549
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,840
Jack's ideas have become more mainstream Overtime Bar agencies like the forest service

550
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,400
Now talk a lot about defensible space

551
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,728
There's more emphasis placed on homeowner responsibility

552
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,360
Jack also helped start the prominent organization firewise which promotes fire preparedness

553
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,688
Shawna legarza the forest service fire director

554
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,528
Does it be enormously destructive fires of the last few years

555
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:03,392
I've also forced people to think about how to make their homes and properties more fire

556
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
Resistant

557
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:09,536
And I think every year there's going to be more awareness about Wildland firefighting in

558
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,864
An evacuation Zone do you have defensible space or not

559
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,168
Just because of the trends every year

560
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,240
You know we saw it last year with largest and most devastating

561
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:24,640
A fire year and now we have this year which is larger and more devastating than last year human fatality

562
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,688
Firefighter fatalities

563
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,528
And with climate change the Fire season is only getting longer

564
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,904
When I asked the Garza if she could imagine a future like the one Jack proposes

565
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
The forest service would get out

566
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
As a firefighting

567
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:46,400
I think we're a long ways from that you know so I mean we're all bored for fired after communities and resilient landscapes

568
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:51,008
Sinper you know folks have defensible space or around around their structures

569
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:57,408
And I'm more healthy Brazilian national forest system slanted we're a long ways from that we are a long way from

570
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,784
The forest service is currently fighting several dozen fires Across the Western United States

571
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
When you're that busy running around putting out fires

572
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Literally

573
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,440
It's hard to focus on how to prevent the

574
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
I'm from being so destructive

575
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
If in the first place

576
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,632
Jack retired from the forest service a few years ago

577
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
Feeling like all his research

578
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,984
Haven't made much of a difference in the end

579
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,288
When he's watching the news

580
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:28,384
Especially coverage of the past few destructive fire seasons in California

581
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,992
You've noticed there isn't a lot of talk about making homes more fire-resistant

582
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,296
Clearing defensible space

583
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Instead

584
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
There's a lot about firefighter

585
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,024
Apocalyptic

586
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
Identify overwhelm firefighters

587
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:53,728
Did what they could no way you could stop a fire front like that

588
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
The fire

589
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,848
One of the very frustrating things that I had

590
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:03,456
Experience this past summer but you really from the California fires

591
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,760
Is the continued

592
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
Sounds

593
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,320
Of fatalism

594
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,880
Oh well there's nothing that could be done

595
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
Well

596
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
Know that

597
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
The bottom line is

598
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:19,072
That we can do something it just doesn't have anything to do with

599
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,096
Controlling the wild

600
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,656
This fire is now 45%

601
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,520
Watching news footage from the California fires

602
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,056
Something stands out

603
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Especially if

604
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
You spend a lot of time with Jack

605
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
Once you get over the shock of

606
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,456
Racine neighborhoods reduced

607
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,320
The drama firefighters talking about how there was nothing they could do to

608
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,856
Stop the flames

609
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,416
Your eyes shift to something else

610
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,720
The green trees

611
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,512
Untouched by fire

612
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,816
Surrounding the burned-out home

613
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,888
We are really

614
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,680
In a battle with nature

615
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:02,080
That nature is more powerful than we are firefighters are battling the fire

616
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:23,328
Next week will be continuing to explore the issue of wildfire and just how hard Jacqueline's ideas can be there in

617
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
Implement in the real world

618
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,424
We'll look at one community in Southern California

619
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,752
Which has been threatened again and again by fire

620
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,824
Beaver preview of that story coming up right after this

621
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:49,952
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sign

622
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,840
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

623
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:01,216
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and another room in Brawl hearing.

624
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,520
Voice technology talk to us

625
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,824
It is a creation of Sonic trash

626
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,640
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

627
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,224
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

628
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,272
To make them more human

629
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,368
Turn the living room lights on

630
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
Okay

631
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
Dim the living room lights

632
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
50%

633
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
Okay

634
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,912
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

635
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,728
Makes for a much more natural experience

636
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,776
Turn the living room lights on

637
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
Dim the living room lights to 50

638
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
2%

639
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:47,296
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

640
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,368
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

641
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,672
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

642
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,744
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

643
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
Right here

644
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,792
NPR

645
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:04,704
We need to talk about something constipation abdominal pain and bloating

646
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,104
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

647
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,736
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

648
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,016
And you don't know why

649
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,320
Then it may be time to seek help

650
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,392
Go to oh my God. Info podcast

652
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536

Dot and Bo

654
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
Back pocket

655
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:38,240
Next week on the show we're going to look at just how complicated it can be for a community to figure out what to do when their face

656
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,800
But the regular threat of destructive wildfires

657
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:45,664
And to do that we're going to spend some time with one Community & Southern California it's called Montecito

658
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,456
It's right next to Santa Barbara

659
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,272
And Daryl Cagle has lived there since the mid 60

660
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
It's a lovely place and it's

661
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
Where I grew up in a

662
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,672
Very comforting to

663
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
To be in the place

664
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,232
That is so

665
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,256
Familiar

666
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,560
The hillsides are covered with Chaparral

667
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,864
The scrubby brush with yellow flowers

668
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,168
And the neighborhoods are aligned with eucalyptus

669
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:13,568
But montecito's beautiful landscape is also what makes the community particularly vulnerable to Wildfire

670
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,920
The Chaparral and Eucalyptus both provide excellent fire fuel

671
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,992
The Canyons that sit below the hills of Montecito

672
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,088
A cozy little spaces for fire can easily take hold

673
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,624
And the town so-called

674
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
Sundowner winds

675
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,720
Blow hot dry air from the desert

676
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
Up over the mountains and through the Canyons

677
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
Spreading that fire

678
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
This landscape

679
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
Fire is predictable

680
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
And it is inevitable

681
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,960
And coupled with a multi-year drought

682
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,008
It is becoming unmanageable

683
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,592
We had no idea that fires were going to increase

684
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,896
Insights in frequency like they have

685
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,712
Maybe it's like the

686
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,296
The frog in the pot slowly coming to a boil

687
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,344
It's just so

688
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,672
Getting worse slowly

689
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,768
For decades the residents of Montecito is it a kind of

690
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,840
Stubborn Pioneer Street that characterizes a lot of California

691
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,888
After fires they rebuild

692
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,424
Continue on with our lives

693
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:17,312
But that kind of optimism is getting harder to sustain as far as become more frequent and more intense

694
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,920
And as a community is force to reckon with rebuilding again and again

695
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
And again

696
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,504
We are entering a new time when

697
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:32,160
Because of the weather in the impacts of climate change and long-term extended drought that fires have reached

698
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,512
A new level of intensity that it's causing us to have to

699
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:43,168
In some cases change our tactics or strategies and to start to you know where we're re-evaluating our deal with this

700
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,008
