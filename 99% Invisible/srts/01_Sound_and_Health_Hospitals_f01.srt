00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,704
And influence our health and well-being

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,016
This is 99% invisible

9
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,296
I'm Roman Mars

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,648
Sound can have serious impacts

11
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,440
Our health and well-being

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,072
And ever since people moved into cities we've been exposed to an unhealthy amount of noise

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:39,424
Cars power lines and a constant ding of our devices

14
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:42,496
We live in a very noisy world

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,592
Most of the noises we hear aren't designed to work together

16
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:52,736
This is the second part of our special series on sound and health supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

17
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,040
We're taking a look at how I more intentional approach

18
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,112
The sound can help us live better healthier lives

19
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,672
And there's no better place to think about health

20
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
Vet hospitals

21
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:08,096
Is an anesthesiologist at Vanderbilt Medical Center

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,912
He spends a lot of his time in the operating room

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,704
The operating room is an inch

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
Christian space

25
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,824
Cuz we think of it it's like my cockpit if you will and anesthesiology

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
Related a lot to Aviation

27
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,968
We are culture of safety we have safety checklist just like Pilots do

28
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,576
We think of takeoff and Landing just like putting a patient to sleep and waking them up

29
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,928
If I can wake someone up from anesthesia we call it land in the plane

30
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,744
Landing the plane takes Focus

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,792
Hangzhou doesn't work in silence

32
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,352
It might come as a surprise but in the OR

33
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,400
There's music playing all the time

34
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:48,288
There's great data that shows that music improve surgical efficiency which can translate to an economic benefit

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,592
And music subjectively makes us feel good

36
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,152
And if you're working long hours being difficult

37
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
Court cases in the operating room

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
If you can improve mood certainly there's benefit

39
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
Who chooses the music

40
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
It's usually the surgeon

41
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,952
And if the surgeons excited the surgery is over and the Music Volume gets cranked up

42
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:10,048
It's really hard for us to be delicate and intentional and Artful

43
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
Elegant

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,448
Joe remembers one surgery where music was playing and then all the sudden

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
The patient's Vital Signs started the crash

46
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,080
Now my alarms are going off the music volume is high

47
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:27,456
The surgeon and I are having to raise our voices and almost yell at each other to communicate

48
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,248
Not because we're mad at each other

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
But just to understand each other

50
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:37,696
So Joan is researchers are trying to figure out how to get the benefits of Music in the OR

51
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,768
Without the risk of hearing we built this city on rock and roll

52
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,816
Well someone is having a heart attack

53
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,984
I'm working with another anesthesiologist on a device which is called the canary box

54
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,800
The canary box has two levels of alarm

55
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,872
Warning Zone and the danger zone

56
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,968
When the alarm is in the warning Zone

57
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
It haves

58
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
The Music Hall

59
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,344
And when the alarm is in the danger zone

60
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
It turns the music off

61
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:12,000
Fixing house sounds work together in the operating room is a step in the right direction

62
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
But it's part of a bigger problem

63
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,096
Doctors know more about the human body than ever

64
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
And are better equipped

65
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
To save your life

66
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
But still

67
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,984
Hospitals are horrible places to get bed

68
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,288
That sound designer Joel Beckerman

69
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
And he's right

70
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,384
Hospitals can be bad for your health because hospitals

71
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
Sound

72
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
Terrible

73
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,296
I think of when I walk into the neuro ICU and I hear the automatic door was open

74
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Closes

75
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,880
If people walk by it opens and closes without

76
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
Anyone going in or out

77
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
And as I walk in there's the

78
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
How about people talking

79
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,816
And it might be clinicians in might be patient

80
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
Families

81
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
I hear the

82
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
Rolling of the

83
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,984
Big metal cart that houses all the meals for the patients

84
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,544
And it's the wheels rolling on the hardwood floor

85
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,360
Yochelson is electronic musician

86
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
Researching sound in hospice

87
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
Linux

88
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Claudius

89
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
It's about

90
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
50 decibels

91
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
Pretty rose

92
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
It goes up

93
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:16,768
Yeezy 360 70-30 sometimes it hits 8290 this place as well

94
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:23,167
TV some perspective 60 decibels is the volume of an average office

95
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:28,287
70 decibels is about as loud as a vacuum cleaner 80 decibels is as loud as a garbage disposal

96
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,687
And 90 decibels is as loud as a motorcycle passing by your so-called

97
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Healing environment

98
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,295
Hospitals can be really loud

99
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,599
But volume isn't the only problem

100
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,671
I hear alarms coming from multiple patient rooms

101
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
And I don't know what's wrong with the patients

102
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,327
The alarms are difficult to localize so I'm not sure which rooms they're coming from

103
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
And even when he knows what he's listening

104
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,215
Joe has a hard time figuring out what device is making noise

105
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
It could be the IV infusion pump

106
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
The epidural pump

107
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,639
The intra-aortic balloon pump the dialysis machine with ventilator

108
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,247
Joel Beckerman has experienced the same thing in hospital sees work done

109
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,575
There is a heart monitor that makes 86

110
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
It's different alarms

111
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
There's no way that

112
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
That can be meaningful to anybody

113
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
The scary thing is

114
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
Most of these alarms

115
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
Are false alarm

116
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,167
It could be due to a loose connection or a temporary blip in the patient's vital signs

117
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,983
But most of these alarms don't tell you anything useful

118
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Still they saturate

119
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
The hospital sounds game

120
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,615
I go home at night

121
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,967
And I still hear the beeping of alarms in the beeping of pulse oximetry in my head

122
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,927
Clinicians are notified

123
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,463
Physician's assistant

124
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,815
I love those alarms like I have my address but I get excited

125
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:59,167
But the high from alarms is not sustainable it's actually pretty exhausting

126
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,983
The result is something called alarm fatigue

127
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,287
The problem with alarm fatigue is

128
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,359
That didn't sound which caregivers and

129
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
Learn to ignore

130
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,223
Means that they also ignore critical alarm

131
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,015
And patients die

132
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,111
This is a very very serious problem that needs to be addressed

133
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:24,255
People complain it's difficult to sleep at night

134
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,327
Distance to sleep it disturbs the arrest

135
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
Noisy environment

136
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,495
Could cause more anxiety Sofia and stressful patients

137
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
NBC

138
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
You know that young

139
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Oh no

140
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,135
Is my baby going to die

141
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,463
You can lead to neuropsychological side effects such as

142
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
ICU delirium

143
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,423
ICU delirium is when patients get confused and paranoid because of the exhaustion of staying in.

144
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
Sometimes this can lead to hallucinations

145
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:12,895
The 80% of patients in an ICU I thought to experience some form of delirium during their Hospital stay

146
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,711
It's the sort of thing that can leave hospital patients

147
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
With PTSD

148
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
I interviewed

149
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
Person

150
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
Key hat

151
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Peace

152
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,975
Daughter in Amazon 10 years ago in NICU

153
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,047
Betsy in ICU intensive care for infants

154
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,143
And there was this particular alarm sounds that kept going off

155
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
So even after

156
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Tenias

157
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
If he hears

158
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
The sound steps

159
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Simatai

160
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,359
To that on television or other places

161
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
He still gets

162
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,711
Disturbed reaction

163
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,807
There a long-lasting effects on the body as well as the mind

164
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
Noisli

165
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,391
It's the stress and stress hormones in the body

166
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
Stiffen our blood vessels

167
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,231
Which can increase the risk of heart attack

168
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
Disgrace

169
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,239
Unnecessary noise is the cruelest absence of care

170
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,335
Realtor that more than a hundred years ago

171
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,919
But I'm guessing hundred years ago there was no

172
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,039
Mustangs in medicine progress

173
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,111
800

174
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
It's like a side effect

175
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,023
Technological advancement

176
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Things got louder

177
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Right now you can't turn alarms

178
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Softer

179
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Silence.

180
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
But the FDA maintains a database

181
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
Found that

182
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
Nearly 600 Payson

183
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
Had adverse outcomes

184
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
Mostly.

185
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
From alarm mismanagement

186
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:57,087
We'll talk about how we can make the sound design of Hospital alarms as sophisticated and precise as the medical

187
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
Cool devices that are blaring the mouth

188
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
After this

189
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
Support for this special two-part series

190
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,071
Exploring the power of sound to influence our health

191
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,119
Comes from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

192
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:14,751
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is working to build a culture of Health that ensures everyone in America

193
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,335
Has a fair and just opportunity for health and wellbeing

194
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,175
Which includes exploring how our current or future environment

195
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
Will impact daily life

198
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,207
When you think of the design of a patient monitor or any device

199
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,279
You think of the visual complexity of the device

200
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,071
And expensive the device

201
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,399
But why is the sound that's generated by this

202
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,983
Highly engineered visually attractive expensive device

203
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,823
Usually comes out of a very cheap speaker

204
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Attached

205
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,223
Medical device

206
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
At least

207
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,623
Dissonant

208
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Difficult

209
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,207
As a musician

210
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
At least

211
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,327
But you'll go isn't the only one taking a musical approach

212
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
Alarm fatigue

213
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,959
Joe may be an anesthesiologist but he's also a professional jazz musician

214
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
Infuriating isn't it

215
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
This is him playing the piano right now

216
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,615
I've been playing the piano since I was 5 years old

217
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,431
So the music and medicine was part of my life

218
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
Together for a long time

219
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,551
Right now alarms are loud and annoying

220
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
But they don't have to be

221
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,159
They just have to be different from all the other sounds in the hospital

222
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
Imagine that somebody down the hall where to scream

223
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,071
And it's not loud but you can perceive it

224
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
We have our attention diverted

225
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,471
Not because of the volume but because of the acoustic features of the human scream

226
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
There's an acoustic feature called roughness

227
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,335
Which has enhanced sensitivity in the Invicta

228
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
So we have this

229
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Reflexive response

230
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,223
This has a surprising implication

231
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
4 alarm tone

232
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Alarms

233
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,367
Can be softer than background noise and you can still perceive them

234
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
A lot of the alarms

235
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Have

236
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,791
What's called a flat amplitude envelope and Sophie imagine the emergency broadcast signal that you

237
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
UCare on TV

238
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,983
That's a flat amplitude on for a minute on natural sound and R&B

239
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,823
The unnatural sound is effective at driving or attention

240
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
But in a hospital these unnatural sounds

241
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
Layer on top of each other

242
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,735
Creating a wall of sound that we tune out

243
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
Elsa create a struct

244
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,575
Harming our minds and bodies

245
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
Pair that

246
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,951
With what's called a percussive amplitude envelope which has an exponential.

247
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,511
The case I think about if you're clinking to wine glass

248
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
Together

249
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
That's

250
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,655
A sharp upstroke with an exponential decay Nexus and we have in nature

251
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
By changing the amplitude envelope

252
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
To something more natural

253
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
You can go from this

254
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
To this

255
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
But even this sound

256
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
Doesn't tell you a lie

257
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
The alarms need to be more

258
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
Informative

259
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,599
What we are particularly working on is how to contain information and sound

260
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
And that is what we call auditory icon

261
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,207
For example having a lub dub

262
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:19,327
Heartbeat type of sound in an alarm that is indicative of a cardiovascular problem

263
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,679
The result is something that can tell you exactly what's wrong

264
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
Before you enter the room

265
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
And that's just the beginning

266
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,591
I don't want to know just when something is bad

267
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,639
I want to know when something is trending

268
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Chords being bad

269
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
I want

270
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
Visual signals that are always in my receptive field

271
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
Prices of monitor that right now I have to

272
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
Baby staring at it

273
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,183
I want vibrotactile information that is wearable and comfortable

274
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
And I wanted to provide

275
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,535
Signals that are not so strong that it gets

276
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Geek

277
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
Or habituated to it

278
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,887
And I want auditory information

279
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
That is directed

280
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,239
To me when I get auditory information

281
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
It's

282
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,103
Information that can mean something in that I need to act upon it

283
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,431
Then we can use the hospital soundscape to do even more

284
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,991
Researchers are finding ways to give a voice

285
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Is the people

286
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
Love lost

287
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,623
You think of a patient in the ICU when they're non-communicative

288
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
Or in long-term

289
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Q care

290
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
Does patient often get neglect

291
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
But they

292
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,351
Have ways to communicate in a non-traditional sense for example to the autonomic nerves

293
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,215
Patients who can't speak or communicate their feelings are still expressing themselves

294
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
To their heart rate or their body temperature

295
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,847
So they're communicating but not in a traditional verbal sense

296
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
How can we take this physiologic

297
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Signals

298
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,503
Turn them into sound in a way that we can start to ask your team

299
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
What these patients

300
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
What is people

301
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Rst

302
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
The result is something called Bayou Music

303
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
Pioneered by

304
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,487
A colleague of Jose at McGill University in Montreal

305
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,815
Sensors on the patient's body to text vital signs

306
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,119
And that makes the data into sound

307
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
Heart rate controls the tempo

308
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
Temperature determines the notes

309
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
And skin sweat

310
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
Drives the melody

311
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,311
The result is actually kind of beautiful

312
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:11,199
Bayou Music is being looked at as a way for nonverbal autistic children to express themselves

313
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
Here's a calm State of Mind

314
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
And here's the Nexus One

315
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:24,767
You don't have to be a medical specialist to hear the difference

316
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
Our hope is that

317
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:32,703
We can make it easy to implement throughout the world where you don't have to be at Bay

318
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:38,335
High-powered academic institution with PSEG equipment to make this a reality

319
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,687
Joel Beckerman believes our Hospital soundscapes can be improved

320
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,247
From an unhealthy and dangerous cacophony

321
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
To something more useful

322
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
Imagine you could walk into a room

323
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
And

324
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,743
Be able to sit through enormous data sets

325
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
By sound alone

326
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,583
We actually create an idealized

327
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,631
Soundscape for what

328
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
Personification of data

329
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,239
Idea might be in

330
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
A hospital room of the future

331
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
Cardigan

332
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Sounds good

333
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,319
You don't need to be musician you don't need to be really intensely trained for this

334
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:25,695
You can determine whether a pitch is higher than another were lower than another if they're pretty far apart

335
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:30,047
You can determine whether a sound is rising or sound is

336
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Falling

337
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,887
A very very short period of time we can help

338
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
People understand

339
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
Those differences

340
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
Do all different

341
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,031
Healthcare data points

342
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
Do understand

343
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
What a patient

344
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,455
Needs for weather. Patient is okay and they can turn their attention elsewhere

345
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,415
When I was a music score

346
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:00,767
Piano teacher told me the more you actively listen to Jazz and you practice

347
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,327
You're adding colors to your palette

348
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,447
The more I study the more I practice the more I listen I have more colors on my palette

349
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,751
I can create a beautiful painting

350
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,847
That's another reason why we need to do this is cuz this adds colors to a pallet

351
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
And I think it's important

352
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,991
From the patient care perspective that we make the most beautiful painting that we can create

353
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,975
This special episode of 99% invisible was produced by Layla battison and Dallas Taylor

354
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
