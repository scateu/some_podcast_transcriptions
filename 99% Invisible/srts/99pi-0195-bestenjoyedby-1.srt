Everyday workers at grocery stores and convenience

00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,936
First thing I do when I come on in Isaac go check the rotation on my milk past check my days of

Of course in Carson

53
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,312
Is dairy manager at a grocery store in Montana and every day when he gets in

54
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,616
Check the sell-by date on his milk

55
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
If it's past the date

56
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,200
Milk must be thrown out

57
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,016
These are all Twenties that I'm pulling off

58
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:04,416
This one is dated the 18th and I will have to pour this went down the drain I have probably six

59
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,280
Ken is originally from Washington State where he also worked in the grocery business

60
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:15,680
When I came here for years ago I had no idea that they were pouring down as much milk down the drain

61
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:22,080
They have been in fact it was repulsive his sickening the first couple weeks here I was

62
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
Hundreds of gallons

63
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
There's nothing wrong with it

64
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,600
Bring out milk happens to some extent in grocery stores all over the country

65
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
That's reporter Meredith

66
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:40,000
Hannah. Montana throws much more of it down the drain than most places

67
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,656
Because the sell-by date on the milk is required by state law to be just 12 Days After pastor

68
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
Translation

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,984
The industry standard is 21 days

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,776
After these 12 days

71
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,360
Montana Law requires that the milk be thrown away

72
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
It can't be sold

73
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Or donate it

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
Seem such a waste

Family Zoo

Journeyed

77
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
And we're doing this

78
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:12,256
Montana is throwing out so much milk affect the price of milk there is about $2 per gallon higher than it is in Surrey

79
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Surrounding states

80
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
And it's all because of the state label

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,936
In theory Montana strict State label law is about food safety

82
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
And protecting the consumer

83
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,776
But it hasn't been updated since the 80s

84
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,872
Date labels of course aren't just on milk they're on a lot of Prada

85
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
Use by

86
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,504
Sell-by best-by best if used by

87
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,600
But then out some products expires on or like having aex

88
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
P witch

89
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,024
Is it shorthand for expires this is Emily broadleaf director of the food Law & policy clinic at

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
Harvard Law School

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,680
She did a tally of all the different kinds of date labeling what we found was that 41 States

92
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,336
Required a date label on at least some food product she says they're huge inconsistencies not Justa

93
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
In the wording

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,152
But in the meaning of these labels

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,968
Some states require them only on Dairy

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
Salmon shellfish

97
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
Summon any perishable foods

98
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,184
And then 20 of those States actually restrict the sale or donation of food after the date

99
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,303
Some of them are quite strict some of them I flat-out band salary donation of food after the date

100
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
And some of them just say we're going to make it complicated

101
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,703
The powers-that-be have definitely succeeded in making a complex

102
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,983
Did to decipher these

103
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
Or to know how to act on them

104
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,359
For large retailers and individual consumers

105
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
Like this is

106
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,295
A bad system it's not making people safer it's leading to food waste and the dates really aren't safety

107
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,063
Debased

108
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
That's right

109
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:46,207
The date labels on our food are not about food safety

110
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
And

111
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,791
They were never actually meant to be

112
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
But let's back up

113
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
It All Began in the 1970s

114
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,471
Americans have moved farther away from their food sources

115
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,567
They were eating more packaged food and getting more of their food in supermarkets

116
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,639
And they wanted a way to measure how fresh their food was

117
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:10,527
Most manufacturers already put encrypted dates on their products to help retailers rotate stock

118
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,367
And consumers craved access to this information

119
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,255
In 1977 the New York State consumer protection board published a booklet called blind date

120
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,815
How to break the codes of the foods you buy

121
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,935
The booklet told consumers how to decipher the encrypted date codes on their favorite products

122
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:32,543
Deboer distributed more than 10000 copies and posted the booklet in supermarkets

123
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
Eventually

124
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,919
Consumers started to demand that these dates be put clearly on packages

125
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
But they shouldn't have to get a special book

126
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
Decipher a code

127
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
And that seems pretty reasonable

128
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,087
Cuz you're not ask for at 8 labels

129
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,487
So retailers in grocery stores responded but at that time everyone acknowledged this is really about quality in about fresh

130
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,887
No one's that I want a label because I'm afraid it won't be safe so a few states begin to regulate these date labels

131
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:04,287
Massachusetts was the first state that actually required date labels on food

132
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
Even though there were a number of attempts

133
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
And one Congress I think from 1973 to 75 there were 10 bills on date labeling standardization

134
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
None of them pass

135
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,879
Lawmakers disagreed about what the system should look like and who should oversee it

136
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,439
The Food and Drug Administration is actually said

137
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:28,095
We could do that as we know we have the power to do it for the foods we oversee but since these labels were about freshness and

138
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
I'm not about safety

139
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
Ultimately the FDA said

140
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,239
It's not something we want to spend the time and energy on

141
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,591
Still consumers wanted freshness date so all kinds of different ones popped up

142
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,407
Summer stamped on some printed on the label

143
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,479
There's no consistency and how this information was displayed

144
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
Or the language that was used

145
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,831
Used by all viabestbuy

146
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
Buy tires on

147
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,975
Some companies even tried to promote these dates to sell their products like

148
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:01,375
Hey by Pepsi because it's going to give you the date to tell you what's fresher than all the other soft drinks

149
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
Don't need to tell you how fresh they are diet colas

150
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,615
Hyundai Pepsi introduces

151
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,479
Some date labels were meant for consumers While others were just meant for retail

152
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Taylors

153
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,135
And as is still true now there were no clear definitions for any of the phrases

154
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,487
No consistency even within the same brand or product

155
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,303
Dates could differ from state to state

156
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,631
Manufacturer to manufacturer or store to store

157
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:40,031
And over the years we've lost track of what these labels meant in the first place

158
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,103
Grabs just being used to having labels on their food no one

159
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,663
No one's ever said to them what they mean and what they don't

160
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,063
So we've made some false connections to people in their head of met this link and thought well I heard about

161
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,367
But someone getting salmonella or E coli

162
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,975
And I see this label on my food and these two things are somehow connected to one another

163
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,303
But Emily says as much as we might want them to

164
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,143
These dates are not going to tell us if our food will make us sick

165
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,727
People keep saying but I just want to know when it will be safe until

166
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:16,127
It's scientifically impossible to sort of say there's a date after which it will become unsafe

167
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
Example

168
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,735
If you run a few errands on a hot day before getting your milk home

169
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,039
Your milk will spoil faster

170
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:28,927
And once it's in the fridge it'll last longer it's a 35 degrees than at 40 degrees

171
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,975
There's just too many variables

172
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,279
But here's the thing about spoiled milk

173
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:39,679
Spoiled milk doesn't mean it has pathogens in it

174
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,239
Json process along with most other bacteria

175
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,055
The big misconception around 8 label

176
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,127
Is that people think that old food will make them sick

177
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,199
But for the most part all food doesn't make you sick

178
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
Contaminated

179
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Food does

180
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:59,647
The longer a carton of milk exists the more teams that has to come into contact with contaminants that could grow and flourish

181
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:06,047
Inside that milk and hurt you as long as it's properly pasteurized about the age specifically that makes

182
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
Dangerous to drink

183
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,399
There is however a small handful of food

184
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
Can become unsafe with age

185
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,031
Deli meats unpasteurized cheeses smoked Seafood

186
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,847
Stuff in the deli section of the grocery store basically

187
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,407
These foods have a high risk for Listeria

188
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
A bacteria that can be life-threatening

189
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,527
And in these cases listeria risk

190
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
Does increase with time

191
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,927
But I current date labeling system doesn't treat this small subset of foods

192
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,999
Any differently than any other date labeled item

193
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,583
Mo State labels are arrived at by conducting taste test

194
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,679
They hit people around a table and then they have everyone eat their product

195
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
Say It's Your Birthday

196
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
They taste a batch made that day

197
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,055
And then they taste some from the day before

198
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:55,455
And the day before that and what did you think was it good that was a tasty did it have the properties you expect for

199
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,807
From yogurt or whatever the product is when the manufacturer comes to a badge the people say

200
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,111
I don't really like the way this taste

201
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,183
They said okay well by for that many days are products not going to be at

202
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:11,583
And that's where the date really comes from

203
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Companies

204
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
They just got

205
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,727
They said you're not so awful about it but we don't have money to bring in and do this whole

206
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
Taste test we just

207
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,407
You know we look online for an estimate of what this few know how long this will be fresh or we just kind of

208
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:30,271
You know I only keep it in my refrigerator for 3 days I'll put 3 days on it

209
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,623
There's some of them are very unscientific about where that date actually comes from

210
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
And yet today

211
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,487
According to a report that Emily Bradley co-authored

212
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,047
Majority of consumers believe

213
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
But eating food past

214
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,143
Its sell-by or use-by date is rift

215
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Their health

216
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:52,031
And as many as 90% of Americans throw out food based on date labels

217
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
At least occasionally

218
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:59,967
Billions of pounds of food here in America simply because of misunderstanding lascaux dates

219
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
Former president of Trader Joe's

220
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,087
He's been in the grocery business for more than 40 years

221
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,159
In 2015 he founded daily table

222
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
Non-profit retail store that

223
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
That sells pre-made meals

224
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,047
Source from food that would otherwise be wasted

225
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,863
We waste staggering amount of food

226
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,959
The average American waist summer between 20 and 25% of the food they choir

227
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:27,359
Just wasting the food is wasting the water to grow at the transportation to get to supermarket everything that goes in the ghetto

228
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
Getting food to your place

229
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
Doug and Emily both say

230
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,735
But to make date label service better

231
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
And to waste less food

232
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,831
We need to consider the language were using

233
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,951
Sell-by use-by enjoy by like what does that mean you know

234
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
And idea of an expiration date

235
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
Is problematic to

236
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
For some reason expired it's dead

237
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,911
Do credit cards expire the dead can't use it

238
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
Heaven forbid your dog expired you know

239
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:59,615
Justin Moore like no one's an expired food

240
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
Eating dead food

241
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,735
I actually prefer most of my food that is this

242
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
When food is perceived as an edible

243
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,391
You can't do anything with it nobody wants to eat at any can't give it to a food pantry

244
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:16,511
States have laws that forbid the donation of so-called expired food

245
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,583
Emily suggests only using the term

246
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Aspired

247
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,911
4 foods that actually do become unsafe

248
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
Is unpasteurized cheeses

249
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Send deli meats

250
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
For everything else

251
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,103
She would go with best if used by

252
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
Today would be to labels

253
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,711
Expires on and best if used by

254
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,295
And this would be a standardized system used all across

255
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
The country

256
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:46,463
Creating standardized easy-to-understand date labels is a design problem that must have a design solution

257
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:53,119
Maybe Emily suggested labels or maybe something else entirely the fix doesn't seem like it should be that hard

258
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
And yet

259
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:59,007
Most of the time when we say this is an issue needs to change people say I agree it's a terrible issue

260
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,847
But then people really got stuck up on what which phrase should we use and

261
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:09,247
How do we decide which foods have which one

262
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,111
70 different this time is now a part of a national conversation

263
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,255
The EPA and USDA announced a goal to cut food waste in the US and half by 2030

264
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,095
And having a better date labeling system is one way to get there

265
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
But for now

266
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,727
Emily is happy to help settle your more micro-level disputes

267
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
Basically

268
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
The answer is

269
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
Trust your taste

270
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
Not the date

271
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
To the story that I heard most

272
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,783
From friends and family from colleagues and I continue to hear now is that you know there's someone that I'm so glad you

273
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,183
Put this report out because I've been telling my wife for years of the days don't matter now I'm really Vindicated or universe

274
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
Vice versa

275
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:56,351
Instead of arguing over date labels you should take part in that other which will that happens between spouses in the refrigerator

276
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,191
Will you open up a dodgy carton of something rather and ask

277
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
The smell okay to you

278
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,663

He talked to us

299
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
It is a creation

300
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423

Okay

308
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation

309
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
But taking away the

310
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487

It's not that bad

You take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine

It doesn't have to Define you constipation and abdominal symptoms come back
