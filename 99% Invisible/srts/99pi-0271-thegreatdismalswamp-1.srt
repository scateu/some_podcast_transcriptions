Every house is haunted

This is 99% invisible

23
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,776
On the border of Virginia and North Carolina near the Eastern Shoreline

25
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,336
Stretches a Great Dismal Swamp

26
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,896
The Great Dismal Swamp actually

27
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,480
That's the name British colonists had given it by the early 1700s

28
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,064
The swamp covers about 190 square miles today

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,392
But at its peak before parts of it for drained and developed

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,440
It was around ten times bigger

31
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,792
Spanning roughly 2000 square miles of Virginia and North Carolina

32
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
That's our own should refuse

33
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,680
And it's understandable why people called The Swamp dismal

34
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,544
Temperatures can reach over a hundred degrees it's humid and Soggy filled with

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Thorns and

36
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Tickets

37
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Oh yeah

38
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
Earthquake this morning

39
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
They named it

40
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
I think someone

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
Appropriately

42
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
That's Eric Shepherd

43
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:01,856
He leaves in Carrollton Virginia and he runs a company that leads tours to the great schism

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,720
Which is teeming with all sorts of dangerous and unpleasant wildlife

45
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
You still have black bear

46
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,560
And some of the

47
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Poisonous snakes

48
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
Yellow flies and mosquitoes I mean

49
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
You still have the hazard

50
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,472
Bear in the swamp

51
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,288
And even if you go in with a compass and a map

52
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
It's easy to get lost

53
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,128
But hundreds of years ago

54
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
Before the Civil War

55
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:31,040
The dangers of the swamp and it's seeming impenetrability actually attracted a lot

56
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,600
Including one of shepherds ancestors

57
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
Who was enslaved in the

58
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
I've read information that

59
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
Approximately 50000

60
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Escape

61
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,816
Africans with through and or lived

62
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,888
In the Dismal Swamp that's a lot of people to come through

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,264
Despite all its predators and bugs all its thorns and Vine

64
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,824
Alex dismalness and small penis

65
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,152
This land was home to generations of people

66
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,296
It was the site of one of the most remarkable and least told stories of resistance to slavery in the United States

67
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
African American

68
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
Set up community

69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
And

70
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
They work

71
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,744
Protected there but they were also in in the state of

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,072
Empowerment that they were not going to let anybody come

73
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,144
They are and move them out of their community in that swamp

74
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
References to the Great Dismal Swamp

75
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,752
In the escaped slaves who settled there

76
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,592
Started appearing in newspapers and other sources in the 1700s

77
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,200
But archaeologists have found evidence that people were living in the swamp long before that

78
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,528
When you look at 1607 all the way to about 1660

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
I believe that the major

80
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,136
Group of people that were coming into that swamp

81
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
Interior indigenous Tamara

82
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
That's Professor Dan Sayre

83
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:48,096
And historical archaeologists and American University and a leading expert on the Great Dismal Swamp

84
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,168
Singer says that these indigenous Americans

85
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
We're seeking Refuge from European settlers

86
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
Who started building colonies

87
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,080
Down the eastern coast of America

88
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,224
Escallonia some sort of expanded intensified in the landscape development of the ranches in the farms at

89
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,064
The plantations and all the stuff to her Serta familiar with that swamp

90
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
It was a sort of the sun team

91
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Place

92
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
Then around 1700 or so

93
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,512
The demographics of the swamp started to shift

94
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,607
By that time slavery was widespread in the American colonies

95
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
And why did enslaved people escaped

96
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,471
The swamp was an obvious place to hide out

97
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,799
News of the swamp probably spread quietly

98
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
Through word-of-mouth

99
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,383
Probably an underground city of Grapevine

100
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,503
That people learn this when they were trustworthy enough they learn the information about to go into the swamp and then fine

101
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
Resistance community

102
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,599
Escaped slaves who found refuge in the swamp

103
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
Came to be known as maroon

104
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
From the Spanish word Cimarron

105
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,743
Meaning wild or Untamed

106
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,071
Unlike some other runaways who headed to Northern cities

107
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
Maroons lived in the wilderness

108
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
And difficult to reach

109
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Places

110
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
Herman to build their own communities

111
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
What the forces of nature and Landscape

112
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
Serving as a buffer between their new lives

113
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
And the society

114
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
That enslaved

115
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,735
Thousands of African-Americans who totally

116
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,343
Created their own world in successfully gave the bird

117
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
As it were

118
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Right

119
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
Do that outside world

120
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,999
Had that capitalistic world that enslaving world

121
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
Sayers has been ears going into the swamp

122
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
And surveying

123
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,423
Quite a journey for participate

124
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Project

125
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
The whole right there

126
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,311
This tape is from a short film about the Dismal Swamp

127
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
Cold landscape of power

128
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
By Nina Shapiro perl

129
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Overtime

130
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,503
Sears has come to love this dismal Terrain

131
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,831
It's all just a wonderful thing that to walk around up there in the

132
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
In the thick of it

133
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,415
And out there in the thick of it

134
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
Emerging from the dark brown water

135
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,279
I'll send you come upon a little plot of dry ground

136
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
Islands

137
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:00,959
And the other pretty good size and medications like 20 30 40 acres and they just sort of sporadically pop-up

138
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,543
It was on these islands that maroon communities form

139
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
Likely a few dozen people on each one

140
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,967
Some mingling and trade happening between the islands that were close together

141
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
And based on archaeological evidence

142
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,111
Sayers has pieced together an idea of what their lives might have looked

143
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:25,023
The shelter themselves The Maroons build elevated cabin but they lifted above the moist ground using wooden post

144
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,375
Sayers knows this because the wood that they used to build the structures

145
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,423
Is change the color of the soil

146
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:36,799
So the post Robson Place and it looks much darker contrasting with that usually lighter soil around

147
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
And the Maroons grew food to support themselves

148
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,407
They probably almost certain

149
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
Cultivated for a community

150
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
Grain rice fields on the swamp

151
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:51,647
I think they did Community labor Camino labor like that you're Gathering Donnelly what they eat on a daily basis

152
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
Probably some of the Surplus

153
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
Storefront

154
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
Winter in hard times

155
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,327
But forming this picture of life in the swamp hasn't been easy

156
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:05,727
Because most evidence of The Maroons has long vanished all the organic stuff

157
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
The Creator

158
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:12,895
The other trees would plant materials whatever that's all along Route of the way so we enforce Lee lost with probably is about

159
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,455
90% or more would they used on a daily basis

160
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,831
Sarah says that normally at other sites from this. You'd find a bunch of mass-produced goods

161
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,391
Like glass containers and lead shot

162
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
Tobacco pipes

163
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
But there's not much of that stuff in the swamp

164
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,071
The dearth of these good speaks to how self-sufficient the Maroons were

165
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,631
There wasn't much from the outside world

166
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Coming in

167
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,287
It's like okay our goal is to settle the swamp in this is our world

168
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
Instead of a bunch of intact artifact

169
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
Sears and his team have found

170
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Tiny bit

171
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,223
Bits and pieces of Old Stone tools

172
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,575
Which Maroons found or inherited from previous Native American and habit

173
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
At one excavation site for example

174
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
They found

175
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,695
5000 such artifacts

176
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
And even though that's

177
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Sounds like a lot

178
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,327
Say or says he can fit them all into a shoebox

179
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
Sayers research suggests that at its peak

180
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
Come around 1750

181
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
Day two right before the Civil War

182
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,311
The Dismal Swamp was home to thousands of self-sufficient maroons

183
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
And it also served

184
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Weather stopping

185
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,175
Four other escaped slaves who were fleeing North

186
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
On the Underground Railroad

187
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,015
But like most maroon communities

188
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,063
It was under constant threat

189
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Discovery

190
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,975
The Great Dismal Swamp is not the only example of a maroon settlement

191
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
Far from it

192
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
Wherever slavery exist

193
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
There were runaways who escaped

194
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,375
To live in the wilderness

195
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
That means there were Maroons in the British pound

196
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,007
In Spanish and Portuguese colonies and then

197
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:47,359
In the newly-independent countries and states that those colonies gave birth to

198
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,455
In some cases Maroons clashed with Colonial forces

199
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,735
Like in Jamaica

200
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,295
Where they fought Wars against the British

201
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
And negotiated treaties

202
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
To stay in their community

203
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,743
In fact there's a settlement in Jamaica where descendants of Maroons still there

204
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
A place called Mooretown

205
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
Tucked away high in the country's Eastern Mountain

206
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Any us

207
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
Maroon communities existed

208
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
All across

209
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
The South and the North

210
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
And even in Western Sky

211
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
My Texas

212
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,663
Homestay in the world

213
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,223
Ingalls Homestead

214
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,319
This is from an interview with a former slave named Laura Smalley

215
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
It was recorded in 1941

216
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,487
Talks about what it was like growing up and working on a plantation in Belleville

217
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
The interviewer ask

218
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
What are the slaves of try to slip away.

219
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
And she replies

220
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,215
Now I hit mama said when she was a girl

221
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:50,847
Did they did Wonder Woman run off and every night she sleep home

222
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
Somebody have with something to eat

223
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
And she get that vittles

224
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
In going back in the woods

225
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
Going back stay in the woods

226
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,831
Did once this man stated which along

229
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463

00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
You couldn't get him out

231

Stay in the world

232
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,679
All the Gold in me

233
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,711
Every maroon Community across the country was unique

234
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
Submarines lived in the woods

235
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,063
It's like a woman and man described by Smalley

236
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
Others lived in the mountains

237
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Swamp

238
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
Some even lived in underground shelter

239
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,511
That they dug out in Wild areas near Plantation

240
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
Sow indoors

241
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,375
Little caves of dance as they sometimes

242
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,471
Call them as well you sometimes not a real house

Stove

246
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
This is Dr Sylvian do you

247
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,223
A historian of the African diaspora and author of slavery's Exile

248
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
The story of the American maroons

249
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
She says that these Subterranean maroon shelters

250
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,415
Brockton ingeniously constructed

251
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
Some Timber supported roof

252
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,303
Complete with trap doors that hit all traces of their presence

253
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
That trap

254
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:22,495
Which Bob turned on the outside at the camouflage to the point that it would be invisible but it would also be

255
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:33,759
Some shelters even had systems of wooden pipes that transported the stove smoke away from the maroons.

256
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
So it wouldn't go away their location

257
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,671
Prodigy youth is found that most Maroons tended to live in one of two types of places

258
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Each with its own advantage

259
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,279
Some resided on the borders of Plantation

260
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
Where the family and friends

261
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
And so they would go back at night it'll just

262
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,471
To be able to get news and also.

263
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
Gather intelligence

264
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,591
Are the Bruins chose to live more removed from civilization

265
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615

00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663

Future

270
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,783
Is that the West security they were just recalled

271
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
To access

272
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,367
But wherever they were

273
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,927
Maroons all had something in common

274
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
They wanted Freedom yes but

275
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
Even more

276
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
They wanted

Metronomy

278
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:23,935
A kind of control over their lives that wouldn't be possible even as free black

People in the North

280
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,519

In the woods

285
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,015
And the swamps even though it was a hard life

286
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
Food of danger

287
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319

White people

290
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:53,375
In the late 1700s white people were rapidly becoming a greater threat than the reptiles of the Great Dismal Swamp

291
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,191
As more and more Europeans arrived in the area

292
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Andrew scares

293
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
And more volume

Wealthy colonists all Economic Opportunity

295
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
In developing the swamp

296
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895
In 1763

297
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,735
A young George Washington yeah that George Washington

298
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:13,599
And his brother John started a company with the goal of saving and proving and

299
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
Draining the land

300
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903

Swamp drainer

303
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:22,303
Eventually their company and others would create a network of canals

304
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,351
So that boats could go into the swan

305
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,423
Of course they use slave labor for all of the

306
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
Dear Stan sayres again

307
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,615
We see suddenly a introduction of a whole new large group of people enslaved workers right

308
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,455
For brought in by these companies to help me get in transforming the swamp

309
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
By the early 1800s

310
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,807
Tract of land has been cleared of trees

311
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:48,671
And parts of the once impenetrable region have been opened up to new people

312
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
And Industry

313
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
But remember this one

314
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Still huge

315
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,839
If Maroons didn't want to engage with that encroaching world

316
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,911
They can still find places removed from the industries presents

317
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,727
Even as that presents became more permanent

318
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,079
Timber Company set up encampments in the swamp for enslaved workers

319
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
Score sent in to cut down trees

320
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
They turning that Lumber into shingles

321
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,991
And ship them all over the region

322
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,879
Which brings us back to Eric Sheppard the tour guide we heard from at the beginning of the story

323
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,183
Whose ancestors spent time in the swamp

324
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
I believe he was

325
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
Migrate

326
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
Great-grandfather

327
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Uncle

328
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,351
His name was Moses Grandy

329
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:35,007
And he was enslaved down in Camden County North Carolina born in 1786

330
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
Randy was a skilled boat captain

331
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:41,407
And his talents were highly sought-after in the canals of the Great Dismal Swamp

332
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
He was a

333
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,759
Waterman that delivered the shingles to the Norfolk

334
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Area

335
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
So they can build houses

336
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:53,183
Call Grandy was working in the swamp it's likely that he got to know some of the Maroons who live there

337
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,767
Wall submarines remain isolated in their communities

338
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,839
Other saw opportunities with the new Timber into

339
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:06,751
Contact between enslaved workers in the Maroons who live near the new Timber camps became pretty comment sometime

340
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
X maroon

341
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,615
Help workers the shingle production in exchange for goods from the outside world

342
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
But one day during his time on the canal

343
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,271
Grandy foul a case of severe rheumatism

344
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,319
And when he needed a place to recover

345
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:25,183
He picked the swamp he ended up living in the swamp for a whole year

346
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
Shepherd things he must have had people

347
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
He could depend on their

348
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,327
I don't think you just do that and not know anybody in the

349
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,167
You knew some people there they watched out for you and

350
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
Over the course of years I'm sure

351
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,263
The Moses watched out for them

352
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,847
In a narrative later published about Moses Grandy's life

353
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,151
He described his time in the swamp

354
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
Read here by our friend Al letson

355
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
I built myself a little Hut

356
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
Provisions brought to me is opportunity

Efficient are cut down a juniper tree

361
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
I converted it into Cooper

Grossed out my arms and shut it with all my might

370
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,615
It was frightened and Madoff

371
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
I put my trust

372
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
The Lord

373
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
Can you don't spot

374
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
I was never attacked

375
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Again

376
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,391
Eventually Grandy recovered and went back to work

377
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,719
In 1833 he managed to buy his freedom

378
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
You became part of the Abolitionist Movement

379
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
Travel to Europe

380
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
Murray spoke out against what he

381
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
CNN Xperia

382
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
And his narrative

383
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,239
Grandy reflected on what it meant to be free

384
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
After so many years of enslavement

385
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,407
I felt myself that almost thought I Can Fly

386
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:54,783
And in my sleep I was always dreaming of flying over Woods Rivers

387
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,599
My gate was so old to buy my gladness

388
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,927
What's the matter

389
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,815
Slavery will teach any man to be glad when he gets his freedom

390
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:16,031
What researchers can tell maroon communities in the states existed as long as they were necessary or as long

391
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
Long as they remained hidden from the outside world

392
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,919
Dancers thinks that the communities in the Great Dismal Swamp

393
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,991
Began to disperse around the time of the Civil War

394
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:29,087
My impression based on the evidence from one interior site right now

395
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,463
Is that somewhere more less coincident with the Emancipation Proclamation

396
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
These communities

397
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
Finally disband

398
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,607
Submarines left to join the union in battle

399
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
And after

400
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
War

401
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,983
Some may have gone looking for newly freed family in the south

402
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,823
Some man travels North some may have settled in neighboring towns

403
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
I want really knows for certain

404
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,943
Many enslaved people weren't allowed to read or write

405
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,015
So personal accounts from Maroons are rare

406
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:03,903
It's only in the past few decades that researchers have started to study most US Marine communities in any sort of death

407
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,231
For a long time it was barely a footnote in US history

408
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
And one reason for this omission

409
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:14,143
Is likely because these communities were intentionally secretive

410
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,167
But

411
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Some academics

412
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,031
I think there's a bigger reason why the stories of Mehrunes aren't told

413
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,847
I think in this case you have a good amount of racism

414
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,919
That that sort of

415
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,223
Coach Serta people's understanding

416
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,343
Most Americans learn about the Underground Railroad way back in elementary school

417
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:38,207
A resistance to slavery that came about through white and black cooperation

418
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
The Dismal Swamp

419
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,791
And other Marine communities

420
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,095
Are all about Black autonomy

421
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,655
A complete rejection of White Society

422
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
Hair salon do you forgotten

423
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,007
I think that's the idea of

424
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,615
Black people taking their lives into their own hands

425
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,663
Not wanting to be any pop

426
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,991
The lobster Community not wanting to be

427
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
Quote unquote free blacks

428
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Cinder North

429
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
Or

430
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,159
Pause for freeing the Sabbath being self-ruled

431
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,463
And leaving the oil

432
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
Kind of freedom

433
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,071
That was not part of the larger discourse

434
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
Obese country

435
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,215
I think we still have a ways to go in this country to be quite honest with you

436
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
In terms of

437
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,823
History uncut and raw

438
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,663
That's one of the reasons Eric Shepherd started his tour company

439
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
He wants more people to know the history

440
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:37,087
He left behind a good government job in Baltimore and he and his wife moved

441
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
Southern Virginia

442
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
Just to be closer

443
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
Bahat

444
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
Money

445
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
Dismal Swamp

446
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,047
I felt as though it was a calling there was an assignment

447
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
Was Annie

448
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
For me to be down in this

449
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
This area like

450
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
Unfinished business

451
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Or whatever

452
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
In 2003

453
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,287
Several sites in the Great Dismal Swamp

454
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,615
We're added to the National Park Service Network to Freedom

455
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,711
Which recognizes 400 locations involved in the Underground Railroad

456
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,527
And a sign at the Great Dismal Swamp

457
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,903
Recognizes that this place wasn't just a stop for people on the Underground Railroad

458
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,975
There were entire communities

459
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
People

460
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,791
Who made this their permanent home

461
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:25,215
Today the largest remaining part of the Great Dismal Swamp is a national Refuge stewarded by the US Fish and Wildlife

462
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,799
Who aim to protect the wildlife that's made a home there

463
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,847
And to preserve its unique Lance

464
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:36,223
Keeping alive the memory of the people who found refuge in his dismal Terrain

465
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
It is strong and Rich history

466
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
Which should be acknowledged

467
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
And we are very proud of our ancestor

468
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Is that a door

469
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
That he'll here on Earth

470
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231

Bootcamp

472
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,559
The rattlesnakes and moccasins

473
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
Even the unrelenting mosquitoes

474
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,679
The very habitat who's dangers allowed

475
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,263
Thousands of people to live in relative peace

476
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
On their own terms

477
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:28,192
We'll share a little gem of an outtake from Sri SRI search of this piece

478
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
After this

479
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
Between the beats

480
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,824
Bongs and Charter of our devices

481
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,408
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

482
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:43,040
If I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

483
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:48,928
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room

484
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,720
Technology talk to us

485
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,768
It is a creation of Sonic trap

486
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,840
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

487
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,424
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

488
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,472
To make them more human

489
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
Turn the living room lights on

490
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
Okay

491
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
Dim the living room lights to 50

492
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
80%

493
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
Okay

494
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,112
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taken away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

495
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,928
Makes for a much more natural experience

496
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
Turn the living room lights on

497
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,072
Dim the living room lights to 50%

498
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:34,496

About how are sounds gay

500
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
Is impacting our health

501
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,872
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

502
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,944
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

503

Right here on the 99.

504
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,344
We need to talk about something

505
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,904
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

506
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,304
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

507
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,936
It doesn't have to Define you constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

508
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,520

Did this project called voices from the days of slavery

517
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,936
Oh that's where I found the tape of Laura Smalley who you heard from any episode

518
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,752
And I'm going through all those interviews

519
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,312
I found this song that's been stuck in my head

520
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,592
And I wanted to share it

521
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,688
On the Library of Congress website it says it's part of an interview with

522
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,224
Wallace quarterman

523
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,784
Recorded in Georgia in 1935

524
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,344
But there are several voices in it or not

525
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,136
Quite sure who they all are

526
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
But is it really good song

527
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
