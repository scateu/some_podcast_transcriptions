24
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,672
Let's start with some Pittsburgh humor

25
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:37,024
This is comedian Tom usual on WDVE in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
My dad's birthday few weeks ago

27
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,656
I thought you know what I'm going to get something really nice for my dad something you really going to like

28
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,728
What time does GPS system you know how those nice ones with it

29
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,288
With the sexy voice that talks to you while you're driving right

30
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
Tom's dad of Life on pittsburgher

31
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,224
Couldn't make heads nor tails of the DPSS directions because I am told

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,576
No one in Pittsburgh actually called anything by its official name

33
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:07,232
It's not Interstate 376 it's the parkway it's not the Liberty tunnel it's the tubes

34
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,632
So the joke goes looking up his dad out Tom downloaded a special plug in that makes the GPS device give tours

35
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
Directions like

36
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Apus

37
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,776
Get on the parkway going towards time

38
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,384
Get off like you're going to candy or you're going up a hill

39
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
Under a railroad track

40
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:31,040
And you're making a left and right the same time

41
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,856
Go pass that crazy Church upper on stilts

42
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:40,768
Make a right and if you go past where Swissvale High School used to be you went too far

43
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Otherwise

44
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,984
Sometimes the stories of what used to be can have more meaning than what actually here now

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,360
The philosopher guiborat a word for using your emotions and memories as a way of wayfinder

46
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
He called it psychogeography

47
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:02,784
That's the philosopher Sam Greenspan geography is particularly useful in Pittsburgh

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
Bob's Diner Bob's Diner that we just passed used to be a car dealer

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
And I know that because it was a car dealership when I first moved to this area Family Dollar across the street

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,216
There used to be a grocery store and I I don't know that one first and that's just

51
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,056
This is Pittsburgh resident Mike Nielsen

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
Rifle things that used to be things

53
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
It's like kind of like history and it's not history like George Washington and the Whiskey Rebellion

54
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
This stuff is so history Mike is not from Pittsburgh

55
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,928
He grew up on the other side of the state

56
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,208
So he moved there

57
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,768
You have a hard time figuring out how to get around

58
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
Because pittsburghers are always telling him to

59
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Turn left

60
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
That's something that

61
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Isn't there anymore

62
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,680
It's a one-day Mike was hanging out with his

63
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Buddy Tom

64
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,008
That is Tom usual the comedian from a minute ago

65
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
Tom was trying out the pit

66
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
Pittsburgher GPS routine on Mike

67
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
I see that the kind of told

68
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
Ways it was normally

69
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
Weather used to be like ash day

70
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Json or whether you

71
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
Italian rest

72
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,344
Yeah I tell you know that's kind of funny but I think anyone telling of the Joker

73
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
Or somewhere along the line

74
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,672
He said something about you know

75
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
Oh yeah where they used to be that Pizza Hut

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
The light went off

77
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
I said yes

78
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
Is the Pizza Hut

79
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
For Mike

80
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,423
The former Pizza Hut was a beacon of light

81
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
Shining through a thick fog

82
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Impossible directions

83
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Because here

84
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
It is Friends comedy routine

85
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,895
Was the one Pittsburgh East Direction he could give that anyone

86
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
Regardless of where they from

87
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
To comprehend

88
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Turn left

89
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,527
Did the place that used to be a Pizza Hut

90
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
They're two Hallmarks of Pizza Hut Arkansas

91
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,647
One the whole thing is built out of traps

92
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
The windows are trapezoids

93
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
Enter frame for this kind of trapezoidal

94
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Paneling on the exterior

95
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:54,143
If you remember your geometry you know that trapezoid is a four-sided figure with

96
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,215
Two parallel sides and two non parallel sides

97
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
It tends to look like a triangle

98
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
With the top chopped

99
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
I see the trapezoid windows then you know it's an old

100
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Pizza Hut

101
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,735
And then there's the roof which often has oversized trapezoidal awnings

102
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
And were they all connected

103
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,087
The top is this big bump that just shoots into the air

104
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
Whole thing looks like a lid for the building

105
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Bratz

106
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Actually one of the

107
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
The kid I thought

108
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Hot and Hot

109
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Same thing

110
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
Thank you Pizza Hut

111
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
Now Pizza Hut Stone all look like

112
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,655
Franchise owners have a lot of freedom and how their stores look

113
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,959
Thought every Pizza Hut has the lid roof

114
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
And the trapezoid features and some might be

115
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
More distinctive than others

116
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,127
But there's still enough commonality in Pizza Huts

117
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
That

118
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
Once you've seen one

119
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
You can

120
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
Usually identify any other

121
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,575
The Pizza Hut School of Architecture is so distinctive

122
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,159
The even when a Pizza Hut goes under and gets converted into a different business

123
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,207
You can still totally tell

124
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
It used to be a Pizza Hut

125
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,095
And every town across the world

126
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
There used to be a pizza

127
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,495
Most of them are still standing in the most of them are not still Pizza Huts and so it's

128
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,079
It's this image that we just all happened when we're all so familiar with

129
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
Okay Mike is definitely overstaying in here

130
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,431
Not every town in the world has a form of

131
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Pizza Hut

132
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,343
And I can get numbers on whether or not the majority of the old-school trapezoidal window Style Pizza Huts are still

133
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
Active Pizza Hut

134
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
But the fact remains

135
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
There's something really funny

136
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:27,839
A little sad but mostly funny about seeing a former Pizza Hut get turned into something else

137
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,399
The satirical newspaper the onion thought so too

138
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
They once had a headline that read

139
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,775
You can tell Area Bank used to be a pizza

140
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
It's funny to unvalidated

141
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,919
It's a Mike Nielsen did the only logical thing to do when you get obsessed with some

142
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
He started a Blog

143
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Anna's blog

144
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
It's called it used to be a Pizza Hut

145
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,063
Which is a Blog about

146
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
The current uses of former Pizza Huts

147
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
It is a global atlas of

148
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
The buildings that used to be

149
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
I can't defend

150
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,047
So I'll just go ahead and say yep that's what I've been doing with some of my spare time

151
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
Even going to work for them

152
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
I guess they're not bad

153
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,703
You know what you get when you abbreviate used to be a Pizza Hut

154
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Utba

155
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Aph

156
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
Though I don't like my kid

157
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Does that sound right

158
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
I mean that sounds horrendous

159
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
I guess that's

160
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:20,063
That's just what it's spelled out the bee should have done a better backronym I should have thought of something that would spell out something really cool

161
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135
Mike started documenting like bath surround

162
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
Pennsylvania

163
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
Like fat pocket Pawn

164
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
In North Versailles

165
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,047
What is trapezoidal Windows don't open a can of seafoam green

166
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Yellow trim

167
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,399
Pretty soon you start getting submissions from across the US

168
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,703
And from Australia and New Zealand

169
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,775
Through this data set some trends

170
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:44,383
Barstool pizza restaurants what I think makes sense to they probably had pizza ovens in them

171
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,479
Maybe stuck around there's Sopranos Pizzeria in York Pennsylvania

172
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:54,367
And La porchetta in Auckland New Zealand there are even cases of Domino's Pizza moving in.

173
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
Smug all and then there's a class of non Pizza rest

174
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,999
Mexican and Asian rest

175
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
Chinese rest

176
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,375
Chinese Hut in Toronto Ontario Souvlaki Hut

177
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,263
In Dandenong Australia the structures that has these businesses All Began life unmistakable

178
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
As Pizza Hut

179
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:19,455
But there are some more interesting ones so I think one of the most popular posts on the Block is the Des Moines Police Traffic Unit

180
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
On that in trademark rights and I quote

181
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:28,671
We all love the idea of the police chief telling all the cops get their act together and get

182
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,511
Get traffic violations under control they will have to work at a Pizza Hut

183
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
And then the mayor coming in

184
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
Breaking the news that they would indeed

185
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:42,239
I'll be working in a Pizza Hut evidence room in the cooler interrogations happening in the booth

186
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,567
Secretaries playing tabletop Pac-Man instead of Solitaire

187
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,359
That is how I picture this one

188
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
And I love it

189
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,711
There's a funeral home in Australia

190
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:58,367
That is in a former Pizza Hut Olson Funeral Homes in revesby New South Wales in a crown jewel of all

191
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Call Advance

192
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,695
Brisbane Australia's Kaos adult

193
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Concept

194
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Cancel

195
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,095
Case it was an adult bookstore and had all the windows kind of boarded up

196
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,167
Adult bookstores 10/2

197
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Window coverings

198
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,223
I can see that Mike doesn't have any particular affinity for

199
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
He went there as a kid

200
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
It's a personal pan pizzas plates

201
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Tabletop Pac-Man

202
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
Pepsi ad

203
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Red plastic cups

204
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
But it's only Jesus

205
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
Funny

206
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
I'm a pretty easily amused

207
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,375
And so I thought it was funny but I think a lot of things

208
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
Funny I think it's more than funny

209
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
Nice project

210
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Points to the fact

211
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
There aren't too many companies

212
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,151
Whose very name describes their own signature brand of mass-produced architecture that they themselves

213
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,759
Although Pizza Hut never meant for architecture to be the focus of their brand

214
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
At least

215
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Not at first

216
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,647
Pizza was founded in 1958 in Wichita Kansas

217
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,463
It was actually founded by two brothers who were

218
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
Students at Wichita State University

219
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
It was sad you know

220
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,959
56 years of later it's grown into the world's largest pizza company with more than 14,000 restaurants around the world

221
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
Where is a public relations director at Pizza Hut

222
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
He says that when Pizza Huts founders

223
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,639
The brothers Frank and Dan Carney bought their first building

224
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,199
Take a sign that only had room for 8

225
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:33,855
It had room for Pizza on top and it only had room for three characters are three letters underneath hat

226
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Did any Scrabble player

227
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
They're really only so many

228
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Three-letter word

229
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
Pizza dad

230
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
Pizza sad

231
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,095
Pizza Peel and they kind of look at the shape of their building

232
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Anti

233
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
Is Colace like a hot

234
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,263
Show me we call Pizza Hut so they have four letters maybe we can call the pizza shed

235
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
Mosquitoes don't eat or something like that

236
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
Don't be real Pizza Hut he's still around

237
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Don't knock knock

238
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,735
It's an up half it's a move to the campus

239
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
The founders alma mater

240
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Wichita State

241
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
Just outside

242
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:09,183
Their school of entrepreneurial ISM the first Pizza Hut is commemorated with a plaque

243
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
And if not for that plaque

244
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
You have no idea what it is

245
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
It just looks like a

246
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Painting brick house

247
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
Area trapezoid anywhere

248
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
Pizza Hut signature look came later

249
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
That was the work of an architect

250
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
A friend and classmate of the Carney Brothers

251
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
The guy by the name of Richard Burke

252
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,823
Brooke wanted $32,000 to do the design

253
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,175
The carnies counter-offered with $100 per Pizza Hut to subsequently out

254
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Burke accepted

255
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,807
And created a lot of the features that we can now recognize today irrefutably

256
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
As Pizza

257
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,951
And from their Pizza Hut architecture and their corporate image became intertwined

258
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,375
And so the carnies and their franchisees began lining the American landscape

259
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
With hot after Hut

260
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
But in their ascendancy

261
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Pizza Hut couldn't

262
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,799
We're simply wouldn't imagine the time

263
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
When the people would not come out in droves

264
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
To enjoy

265
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Personal pan pizza

266
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
Radetzky breadstick

267
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,039
As market trends shifted away from the dining experience

268
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Shandong delivery

269
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
Mini Pizza Hut closed

270
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,951
And as their trapezoidal Windows went dark

271
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
And the roof hump

272
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
Rosa empty parking lots

273
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:22,143
It was as if a company had a litter the world with monuments to its own.

274
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,239
Klein it reminds you that there used to be Pizza Hut's everywhere and that there aren't

275
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Anymore

276
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
We see the old

277
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
Pizza Hut's laying around

278
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
Set of the dead carcasses along the road

279
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
And now Pizza Hut's architectural Legacy

280
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
She is one that will remind passersby

281
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:43,135
Other companies failure to thrive in every single place it ever fail to thrive

282
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
But Doug terfehr of Pizza Hut

283
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
App Store

284
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Triumph

285
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
We're pretty proud of the fact that

286
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,119
Our business became so recognizable

287
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,775
That you can just look at a building and recognized even as it got turned into something and then maybe even turned over into some

288
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,871
Something else again that one you just look at it people know that used to be a Pizza Hut

289
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
That that's really cool to us

290
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
I have to say

291
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
I think I'm with Doug on this one

292
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,415
Guess the hubris of Pizza Hut is the stuff of Greek tragedy

293
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,743
But this is not a story about failure

294
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
It's a story about hope

295
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
What can be reclaimed

296
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,655
About the possibilities for what might emerge

297
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,727
Couldn't have ever been dreamed up from the outside

298
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
In a hermit crab moves into its shell

299
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
Pizza Hut

300
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,151
Is actually curbing the rise about that

301
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,711
In the late 1990s and early aughts

302
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,783
The company shifted towards a carryout and delivery model

303
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Today

304
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,135
About half the Pizza Huts in the US operate out of generic

305
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
Glass box looking structure

306
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,487
No trapezoids no sloped roofs

307
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
They don't stand out

308
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,095
In fact a newer style Pizza Hut near my apartment

309
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Just went out of business

310
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:01,727
And if I hadn't ever seen it in operation there be no way to know what it once was

311
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,335
Now that I've seen the next generation of faceless used to be a Pizza Hut

312
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,175
I think that if Pizza Hut phase out their signature buildings

313
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
It will be a

314
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
Huge mistake

315
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,807
Because Pizza Hut has achieved a level of great

316
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,415
I mean how many other structures have there ever been in his

317
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,767
Who's true Essence and shine through whatever might come after it

318
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,911
If you open the hamburger joint in the Great Pyramid of Giza it will always first and foremost be

319
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
The Great Pyramid of Giza

320
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,543
Turn left at the place that used to be the Great Pyramid of Giza

321
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,823
Like the pyramid

322
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
The Pizza Hut

323
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
The Humble Pizza Hut

324
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
Succeeds in edging its identity

325
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,247
To everything else that will ever come after it

326
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
It is at that level

327
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
The Pizza Hut

328
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,903
Manages to constantly remind everyone hey

329
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
I was here

330
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,023
I am the place with a personal pan pizzas

331
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,583
With a translucent red plastic cups

332
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
With a tabletop Pac-Man

333
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
So what a stand in all of the mighty Pizza Hut

334
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
Which more than just about any other once-beloved establishment since crumbled beneath the sands

335
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,967
Signs of time can reach into the future and Proclaim

336
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
Just try and forget about me

337
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Just try

338
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
99% invisible with produced this week by Sam Greenspan Avery trufelman and me Roman Mars would help

339
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
From Margaret Krause

340
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:25,343
Thanks also to Andrew Wasson who wrote about the history of Pizza Hut architecture for the zine in Derry River

341
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:31,487
We are project of 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco and produced

342
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,071
How did the offices of arcsin a brilliant Architecture Firm

343
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,887
In beautiful Downtown Oakland California

344
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,519
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

345
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,103
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

346
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
If

347
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:54,527
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

348
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,159
All hearing. Voice technology talk to us

349
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,463
It is a creation of Sonic trash

350
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,535
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

351
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,119
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

352
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
To make them more human

353
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
Turn the living room lights on

354
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Okay

355
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,359
Dim the living room lights to 50%

356
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
Okay

357
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,551
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

358
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,623
Makes for a much more natural experience
