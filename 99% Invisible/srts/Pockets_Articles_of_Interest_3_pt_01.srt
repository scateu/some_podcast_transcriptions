19
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,768
Every house is haunted

20
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,328
I had never worn a dress

21
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:11,168
I'm sure it was like slightly graceless test like all the things I did it

22
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,496
Time seemed to offend IMAP hears on our very first

23
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
Wheaton College

24
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
It must have been

25
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
Dave

26
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:22,432
One or two it was really early to a super PC liberal arts

27
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,992
School and so are freshman mixer

28
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272
Was a cross-dressing dad

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,880
But you're such an outdated term now but whatever that's what it was called I think all he told us was

30
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,928
You should wear clothes of the opposite

31
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,696
Cisgender

32
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,280
They probably said it in a way that slightly more you know literate in the difference

33
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,072
Between gender and biological sex

34
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
What I just said

35
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,168
It was a strange way to make First Impressions on each other

36
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,800
Not because we were scared of wearing dresses or backwards baseball caps or whatever we were that night

37
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,920
Is because for many of us we could borrow clothes from the other people in our Hall

38
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
With weirdly intimate

39
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
Peers and I

40
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
Complete strangers

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
Swapped outfits

42
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,648
You're tall and I'm tall and I think that you're probably the only person

43
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,952
In the Hall of the building she's close with it

44
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
I remember I loaned peers

45
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,304
Pink swirly patterned mini dress

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
From the sixties that I bought from a thrift store

47
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,144
And I have no idea if he would

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,936
Take care of it or even return it

49
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,728
Peers tried it on

50
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
He went to check himself out in the bathroom down the hall

51
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Here's what happened.

52
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
I immediately locked myself out of my room

53
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
Oh no my Keisha from my room

54
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
Because I did never put them

55
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
The dresser

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,368
Piers is brand new roommate let him back in

57
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
But then he went to sleep

58
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
So peers wanted to make sure he didn't make that much

59
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
Mistake again

60
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,536
He couldn't lose his keys at the party

61
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
We all ended up in the big dance hall where there's really loud music and it was like

62
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
Unbearably hot

63
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
All the ladies

64
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,240
Eyebrow pencil mustaches were running as their teeth

65
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,800
With sweat and things like that and

66
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:57,152
I believe I just clutched my keys in my hand and thought about it really hard all night

67
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
Which sounds crazy

68
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
Articles of Interest a show about what we wear and so maybe the ideas about clothes

69
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
Ideas about to a piece of cloth

70
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
Wear clothes

71
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
But if you ain't got the attitude install the carrot off

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,800
Manuel District closed.

73
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
Women's wear

74
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
Is littered with fake pockets

75
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
But don't open

76
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Or shallow pocket

77
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
Guess I could hardly hold a paperclip

78
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
If there are Pockets at all

79
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
They are just smaller

80
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
And they sent

81
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
Less than men's

82
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
It's due

83
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
And you have to take my word for it

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,232
We are going to the police supply store

85
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,560
I want to find an example of a uniform that had pockets

86
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,120
And compared those made for men and those for women

87
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,192
This is the shop that provides the uniforms for the Oakland Police

88
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,288
When I asked the store manager if I could look at the men's and women's uniforms

89
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
This is what he told me

90
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,664
Are you ready for this I'm ready for the the women wear the man

91
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
Really because of pocket

92
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
Too small

93
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
Really that's your eye

94
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
But there is a women's

95
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,880
Well I've got some over

96
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,416
Traditionally

97
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
They use the men

98
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
Because

99
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
The pockets are bigger

100
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,119
How to make him put things on him where the women's are smaller which I can show you

101
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
Yes

102
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
That's fascinating

103
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
Now you have something

104
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,775
I'll give you something to blog about

105
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,103
Men's great evolutionary advantage

106
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
Is the creation of tools

107
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,223
The problem is we're not marsupials we need to carry them somehow

108
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,343
And this idea of who has access to the tools they need

109
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
Who can walk through the world

110
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
Comfortably and securely

111
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,231
This is what we are talking about

112
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
When we talked about pockets

113
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Pocket

114
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Speak to the

115
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,167
Question of preparedness and your ability to

116
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
Why can't I be confident

117
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,359
It's really difficult to get around if you don't have what you need and it's about I think mobility and movement in public

118
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,759
Hannah Carlson lectures at the Rhode Island School of Design where she teaches classes in material culture fashion history in fashion Theory

119
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
She's working on a book about pockets

120
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,439
Is the formal question for me is what is it what difference does it make put together what's the difference in a pocket in a bag

121
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
And I think the key difference is that the

122
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Pocket

123
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
Is internal and

124
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
Secret a bag can be stolen

125
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
Tea bags can be lost

126
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
And then

127
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
That's it

128
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
You don't have your things anymore

129
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,031
With pocket inside you don't have to think about it

130
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
You forget about it

131
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
You still have stuff in there

132
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
It is

133
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Penises

134
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
Territory of your own

135
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,503
That connects you to the object you carry

136
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
Those objects

137
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
Become part of you

138
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
Kissing point

139
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
Thomas Jefferson

140
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Jefferson

141
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,207
Was called Walking calculator

142
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
For all the miniature tools and devices

143
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,351
Scale drawing instruments of thermometer

144
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
Surveying Compass a level of globe

145
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,471
And he was able to jot down his observations

146
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
From his daily wanderings

147
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:09,151
Historically men have been the ones with these tools for public life on their person at all times

148
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,503
In Hannah Carlson's research she found a lot of accounts of women complaining about this

149
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,855
One woman noted that her son was better equipped than she or her daughter

150
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,927
And she concludes that a boy's pockets are history

151
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
Tificate of Empire

152
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,791
All through life he will carry the scepter of dominion by the right of the

153
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
Great language I loved

154
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
I mean it's playful it's

155
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
Funny but there's some seriousness

156
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
Hear about

157
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,591
What leader costume historians call real social handicap

158
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
Pockets are just a

159
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,431
Perfect metaphor for privilege

160
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,271
Not only because they are so easily taken for granted by the people who have them

161
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
But also because

162
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,367
Like the categories of race and gender themselves

163
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
Pocket disparity

164
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
Is a construct

165
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
It's made out of

166
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,535
There's no reason for women's Pockets to be so small

167
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
Back in the 18th century

168
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
Women's pockets

169
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
Quite large

170
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
She could hold

171
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
Quite a lot

172
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
Women putting

173
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
Hooda net

174
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,359
He later

175
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,431
Writing tools maybe a small diary

176
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
Sowing implements

177
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
Especially if you had to

178
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,367
This is Clarissa esguerra

179
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,159
Associate curator of

180
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
Los Angeles County Museum of

181
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
And where are we now

182
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
We are in a

183
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,119
A storage area at the Museum Fire Department

184
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
Until we have everything laid out

185
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
On a table

186
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,751
Currently covered with tissue but I will reveal them when it is

187
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,311
Is it allowed to pick on the radio but indulge me for a

188
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Pockets

189
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Used to be

190
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
A completely separate

191
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Garment

192
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
They're really more like pouches

193
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
Pockets

194
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,575
Send it from the waist has a really long song

195
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
Actually it started

196
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
For both men and women

197
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
In the Medieval era

198
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
Are there were suspended from their waste over there

199
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,303
Henan and sometime in the late 17th century

200
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
Men started

201
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
Having clothes made with

202
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
Incorporated they were in their coats

203
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
The waistcoat and in their breeches

204
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,311
And women's Pockets remain separate from the rest of clothing

205
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,383
Fanny pack

206
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
The pockets

207
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
On the inside of your jeans right those

208
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
Teardrop-shaped

209
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Couches

210
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:28,415
They're kind of like that but they were just on their own like separate from pants and they were attached to it

211
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,719
String tied around

212
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,071
And in some cases these patches are really big like the length of your forearm

213
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
Andis detachable Pockets Worthen Warren

214
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
Under women's dresses

215
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,751
So even a lot of old dresses look like they have pockets

216
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
They really just have cuts

217
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
What's in them

218
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,615
Women's hats made in the petticoats

219
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Dresses and

220
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,943
Could access our pockets

221
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
Spike going through the

222
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,831
You can reach through your dress to get to your detachable pocket

223
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
That makes sense

224
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
Sherwin

225
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
Would like to see them

226
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,231
What should I start with

227
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,303
The more simpler ones and then kind of go to the more complicated

228
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
Because they're a really

229
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,655
Functional but also they were an opportunity for

230
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Splendor

231
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,519
I'm actually just going to cut to the complicated expensive fancy pockets

232
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
They are indeed very splendid

233
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
Oh well

234
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Disease

235
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,431
Very very finely embroidered

236
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
This one is a silk pie

237
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,807
Pocket and it's lately quilted and then it is covered with

238
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
What is beautiful

239
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
Floral

240
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,463
Chain stitch embroidery so these are all tiny tiny little chains

241
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Stitches

242
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Oh my God

243
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
It's really fun

244
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
Match

245
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
And this is something that she just wore

246
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
And only she and

247
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
The woman who

248
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
How to get dressed

249
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
Perhaps your lover song

250
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,335
Pockets were almost like lingerie

251
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,895
Especially the beautiful expensive ones

252
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,943
The pockets for the intimate thing

253
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Close to the body

254
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
Holding your mouth

255
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
Precious items

256
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,855
Safe under the layers of your ginormous fluffy dress

257
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
And then came the French Revolution

258
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,463
French Revolution happen

259
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
Which

260
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,791
In many ways was a revolution against

261
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Access

262
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
These dresses that

263
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Wer

264
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
Silk skirt

265
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,239
No longer fashionable in what was fashionable

266
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
Sundresses

267
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
Cling to the body

268
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,687
So when you get to the 1800 and that empire style wear the waist

269
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Is pretty much gone

270
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
Can't think of Jane Austen movies

271
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,343
Do you have the columnar silhouette silhouette like a straight Greek

272
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Column

273
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,951
And some of these columnar dresses have slits for Pockets but a lot of them

274
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,023
R2 body-hugging to accommodate extra bulge

275
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,119
There's no space for pockets and so suddenly women begin to carry little person

276
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:51,519
And there's lots of ridicule about women having to lose their pockets and having to carry these silly bags

277
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,991
Teeny teeny tiny little drawstring pouches

278
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
Elaborately beaded & Decker

279
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
Beheld maybe a few

280
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Kucoin

281
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
He's but like

282
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
That's it

283
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
And you could

284
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,487
Hanging Loops of the draw string around your wrist

285
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
Which was another reason why it was considered ridiculous

286
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
You have to remember to carry it is

287
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
Easy to lose people can steal it

288
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
That's the

289
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
Formal difference

290
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
But

291
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
It's kind of price you pay for a fashion

292
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
The little bags were in style

293
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,871
I mean you can see why if you look at them they're beautiful

294
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,455
That very fancy Beautiful Things shell-shaped 2

295
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Made of silk

296
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
Gorgeous paintings

297
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
That should be seen

298
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
And not particularly capacious

299
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,671
This is dress historian Barbara Berman

300
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
The ridicule

301
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
Becomes a kind of temporary

302
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
Fashionista saying

303
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,327
And so you get jaundice writing in the

304
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,423
First and second Decades of the nineteenth Century about pocket has

305
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,543
The fashion press Made pocket seem like they were for housewives

306
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,407
For women who needed to Lug around sewing kits and bits of food they were saving for later

307
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Empty pockets

308
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,247
We're going out dancing and gambling

309
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,551
They have these peaceful sabbaticals and

310
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,623
Professional I don't need to carry keys and

311
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Bibles

312
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,487
Pennzoil gold is useful things in the

313
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Play much more out and about

314
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
Until you have to poke assistant practice papers

315
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Strong alone

316
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:29,567
In the 19th century fashion magazines were saying it was a liberating thing

317
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
For women not to have

318
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
To be free from tasks

319
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
Reticule would hardly hold anything

320
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,319
We're kind of like long nails but don't let you use your hands as much

321
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,391
What's the Leto heels but don't let you walk as far

322
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,719
There's that luxury in not moving too much

323
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
Are doing too much and just

324
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
Looking really good

325
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,631
It's always been an ongoing debate if that is empowering or not

326
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,983
What is a reticule completely killed at the tie on pocket

327
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
They were still around

328
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
A woman who cuts a well

329
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
Have a pattern for kids

330
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,639
And what's her excuse when she wants picture

331
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,039
This kind of pocket carry out live spectacle you find mean using the 17th

332
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:18,207
So what why don't we have these anymore if it wasn't for Columbus LOL

333
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
That's me

334
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
If you can come up with

335
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Spell difficult

336
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
To pinpoint

337
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
Safe age for music

338
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
Become old fashioned

339
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,727
More dresses. Have integrated for kids

340
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
But they're often very small

341
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
Shuffle ways but they offer baseball invented

342
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
The women wear that had integrated pockets

343
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,479
Tended to be feminized versions of Menswear

344
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,783
It made by Taylor's no dressmaker

345
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,599
Taylor Swift

346
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Putting in

347
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
Fit in pocket

348
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:54,559
Because of using male outfit had an inset pocket

349
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,399
It was a uselessly proportion version of a men's pattern

350
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,983
Pocket is seen to be a monopoly of the male sex

351
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
Eventually

352
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,311
Pockets in trousers R1

353
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
As women's Fashions changed

354
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Pockets

355
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Camelot

356
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,479
And as men's fashions change Pockets can be gained

357
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,599
And they were again and again and again Pockets were getting added in added an additive

358
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
The course of decades

359
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
By the early 20th century

360
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,207
It was just getting ridiculous

361
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
Copious amounts

362
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,535
The pockets I can't even like you happier

363
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
Ticket pocket for the train

364
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,143
Watch pocket

365
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,751
Pocket City have all the pockets in your waistcoat and then in your trousers

366
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,311
Really interesting and women have one purse

367
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,383
Both genders extremes were starting to get terrible

368
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Because pocket

369
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,223
It's a proliferated they had become completely worth

370
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,367
We couldn't find anything you stopped on the street yet to Pat yourself down to remember where you've left your wallet

371
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,439
The average man of 1944 head 24 pocket

372
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
Way too many

373
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
At least according

374
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
To Bernard rudofsky

375
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
He was kind of

376
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Enraged

377
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
By the way that pocket

378
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
Stop popping up

379
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,727
Bernard rudofsky Was An Architect

380
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
Modernist

381
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
Modernist for really into sleek

382
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,967
Simple buildings that were absolutely functional with no access with his modernist who wanted to make clothing Park

383
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
Perfectly rational

384
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
And he found it ironic

385
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,343
That all his fellow rational modernist architect

386
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
We're all wearing

387
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
Suits he wanted to I think shake-up

388
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,999
This confidence that we have about

389
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:33,887
A suit a suggestion of it is not modern in any way it has all sorts of old ideas and beliefs

390
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,935
And this pocket that was once

391
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,751
Functional is now no longer functional because we have so many

392
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,311
And to prove his point God love him rudofsky

393
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,127
Put on an exhibit at the New York Museum of Modern Art

394
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
1944

395
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
And it was called

396
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
Are clothes modern

397
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
?

398
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
Are clothes modern with a

399
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
Central peace in Rudolph's Keys Moma exhibit

400
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,207
Big multi-layered infographic

401
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
It looks like an x-ray

402
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
A man's three piece suit

403
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,863
We have color-coded the pockets in his shirt

404
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
It is vested is

405
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
Coach and over

406
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
And you see that's wonderful

407
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
Chaotic overlay

408
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:17,151
The average suit had 24 pockets and 70 buttons

409
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,759
Rudolph he was really passionate about how completely silly and redundant this was

410
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:26,367
The guy is a wonderful nutball but he was really onto something

411
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,439
Because he wasn't only about abolishing suit

412
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
Pizza Hut

413
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
At the root of this in

414
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
Saying pocket conundrum

415
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,095
With a much larger problem

416
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,887
Which is about

417
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,959
Generally what we consider clothing to be

418
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
Clothing hanging on

419
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
Hangers to him look like

420
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Peoples

421
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,847
Dead

422
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Skin

423
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
He wanted to be blue

424
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,247
You sure that you can travel to a friend's house and they would have clothes for you

425
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
Because

426
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
Clothing wouldn't be individuals

427
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
Body

428
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
A universal size mean

429
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
Where's the clothing unisex

430
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
Universal clothing

431
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
According to Rogowski

432
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
More like a toga

433
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,071
Or apparel that embrace the nature of cloth itself

434
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,375
Something that would drape and move matcher

435
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
You know he hated the idea that

436
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,959
Too close we could

437
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,799
Show ideas about status and gender that were unfair

438
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
He hated this

439
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Spanx the waist

440
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
So he wanted this

441
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
You know really simple cloth

442
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,271
And of course the images that he showed his ideas

443
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
For this

444
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,831
New utopian future

445
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
Are very simple clothing

446
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
That have no pocket

447
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
A world with no pockets

448
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
At all

449
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
And no bags

450
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,327
You might know the perfect world when you arrive there by its

451
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
Pocket listing

452
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,679
My college friend appears got really into researching and reading about pockets

453
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,727
Long after his debacle with my dress

454
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,287
There's this whole strain of thought which suggests that

455
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
If

456
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
The world were perfect

457
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,687
Which society were perfect if we lived in a Utopia of some kind

458
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,247
Where you don't have to worry about your physic

459
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,551
Eagle safety. To worry about somebody robbing your house

460
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
You wouldn't need pockets

461
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
In order to

462
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,159
Carry money in order to carry keys

463
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,463
And certainly in the course of time

464
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
We've come to hold

465
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
Fewer and fewer things in our path

466
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,887
All those little devices of Jefferson's are contained in a single phone

467
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
That we

468
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,959
Carrie externally on our body

469
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
And

470
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,799
Pocket really is this sort of knowledge

471
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
Envelope

472
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
Compartment

473
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,407
But the phone stays adjacent to us

474
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Remove

475
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,479
Encased in a bag

476
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,319
I tech company of tried to sell us on wearable

477
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,135
An apple watches in Google glasses

478
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,951
Which would take your tools out of your pocket entirely

479
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,023
And maybe bring us a step closer to that

480
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Pocketless Utopia

481
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,631
These products haven't taken off in the way they were supposed

482
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,191
Wearables were foreseen a long time ago and we

483
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,983
We still feel a little anxious about their use

484
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
I think there's just

485
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
Too much doubt at the moment about whether that

486
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
Utopia can never work

487
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:58,687
And perhaps one day we will have all of our tools and planted in our skull

488
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
Or embedded on an accessory with

489
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,039
Everyone will be able to access in the same way

490
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,343
And then when we get there

491
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,415
Pockets will seem just as ancient as rudofsky

492
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,439
He thought them to be

493
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,559
Already it seems so Antiquated that clothes are needlessly gendered in the way they are

494
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,375
Because we should all have access

495
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
To the tools we need

496
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,959
Or at least a place to put our hands

497

Bongs and chatter of our devices

524
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,127
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

525
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
If

526
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:11,551

To make them more human

533
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
Turn the living room lights on

Okay

537
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:44,576
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

538
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,880
Makes for a much more natural

00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,232
Spurs the assertion of utility

561
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
So utility itself

562
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,352
Like how plaid fell into style once it could be worn in Scotland anymore

563
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,656
Or how high heels developed from riding shoes

564
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,216
Became trendy once we took them off horseback

565
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,032
Who was it and Hollander notes that

566
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
Fashion instantly Mox

567
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,872
Sensible inventions in clothing

568
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,688
Subjecting them to unfunctional usage

569
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
As soon as they appear

570
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,016
And that's absolutely true of pockets

571
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
I mean

572
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,832
You can think of the wonderful

573
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Ornate

574
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
Suits of the macaroni

575
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:29,792
Like when Yankee Doodle stick a feather in his hat he thinks that makes him one of these Dandy macaroni

576
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
Who were these British youth

577
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:37,216
In the 1770s and 80s these young men with big elaborate hairdos and he's tight little coats

578
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,800
And their coats were so narrow and form-fitting.

579
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
Once again in the name of fashion

580
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,920
The front pockets became useless

581
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:51,296
And so now they have this pocket that makes no sense and so Taylor's invented what is the breast pocket

582
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,600
Put it inside the coat of the breast

583
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,440
Clothing is always shifting in and out of practicality

584
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
Sometimes

585
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,560
Just because something is useless doesn't mean it's meaningless

586
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,096
Lake with a pocket

587
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
Even if it can't hold much

588
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,960
Sometimes it matters that it's there

589
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
Sometimes

590
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,800
It matters exactly how its play

591
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,992
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

604
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,696
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

605
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,000
Actually if I'm being honest

606
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,048
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

607
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,728
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

608
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:17,056
Was found dead in my private gym

609
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,384
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

610
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,736
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

611
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
Now

612
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,064
I need to clear my name

613
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,208
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
