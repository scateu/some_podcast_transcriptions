I'm Roman Mars

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,024
On January 7th 1998 an envelope landed on the desk of Larry Calloway he was a

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,888
Call messed with the Albuquerque Journal it was sort of a combination of it

28
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,448
Press release in a ransom note

29
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
And

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
A photo

31
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:54,176
The photo was a Polaroid of a cut-off riding boot with a huge Spanish

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,992
All in bronze

33
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
Can I read the note the new hinted that the bronze foot came from a statue of a man named Juan

34
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:09,792
Hyundai Oneonta horse it was part of a monument on the side of a rural Highway near where

35
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,608
They founded the first Spanish colony in New Mexico

36
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
Back in 1598

37
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,728
Larry figured this was probably a hoax

38
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
Visit Stan Elkhorn a reporter with the investigative podcast reveal there are collaborators on the story today

39
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:28,480
So he handed the tip-off to the news from and a reporter

40
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040
Called up the visitor center at the Oneonta Monument

41
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,136
And Ashley is your statue missing a right foot

42
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,280
And he went out

43
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
You don't go in shock

44
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
Shutters gone

45
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,800
Onate is one of the world's lesser-known conquistadors

46
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
His name is all over New Mexico

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,176
They're onate streets onate schools

48
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:03,040
For decades there was an annual Fiestaware one lucky guy would get to be on yacht A

49
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
Complete with that cape and helmet

50
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:11,488
There's even a song

51
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:16,864
In parts of New Mexico

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,424
He's treated as a kind of founding father

53
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,008
But history is not all song and dance and wearing capes

54
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,056
He was a conquistador after all

55
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
The envelope larry gott

56
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,664
Also included an excerpt from a history book

57
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,992
On oneonta's treatment of New Mexico's native people

58
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:38,880
It described an incident that ended with onate sentencing a group of men from Acoma Pueblo

59
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,440
To each have one foot chopped off

60
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,280
If the symbolism of removing the statues foot was unclear

61
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
The note made it explicit

62
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,888
It said we took the liberty

63
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:56,032
Every moving on yachty's right foot on behalf of our brothers and sisters at Acoma Pueblo

64
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
We will be melting this foot down

65
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:04,480
And casting small medallions to be sold to

66
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,552
Those who are historically ignorant

67
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,416
The statue sculpture cast a new right foot and reattached it

68
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
The medallions never turned up

69
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
But the story stuck

70
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,327
You got picked up by NPR and the New York Times

71
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,399
I was a 7th grader in Albuquerque at the time

72
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:27,007
And what I remember is how the subject I found most boring history

73
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
Was Suddenly at this exciting mystery

74
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
Remains unsolved to this day

75
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
Who stole onate foot

76
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
And then there was the timing

77
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,879
1998 was the 400th anniversary of oneonta's arrival centenario celebration

78
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
And although this date

79
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,231
It would be theater parades commemorative stamp

80
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,815
In a second note to the paper these so-called friends of Acoma Road

81
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,911
We see no glory and celebrating onate Sports Centennial

82
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,959
And we do not want our faces rubbed in it

83
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,615
In other words the point of cutting off the statues foot was to spoil the party and the centerpiece of that party

84
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:10,015
That got a mention in all the foot cutting stories with a cuarto centenario Memorial being planned for our

85
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
Albuquerque's historic Center

86
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
The Proposal

87
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,183
Another bronze statue of Juan de onate

88
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,279
This one right in the middle of New Mexico's biggest city

89
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,607
But with all of his new attention on onate

90
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,679
The second statue wasn't going to get built

91
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Without a fight

92
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
I still didn't see the storm that was coming

93
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
It was still in its infancy

94
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:39,967
Conchita Lucero was one of the organizers of the 400th anniversary celebrations in Albuquerque

95
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
And one of the most passionate advocates

96
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
For a new onate statue

97
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,647
Passion that goes back to her childhood

98
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:53,023
Growing up in 1950s New Mexico knowing almost nothing about onate

99
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,095
Or the states two centuries as a Spanish colony

100
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
When I was a child

101
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
At 10 years of age

102
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,263
I asked my grandmother who was the school teacher

103
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
I was reading the American history

104
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Books

105
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
I said the dark people do anything

106
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
You know that's how I felt

107
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
She didn't know

108
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
New Mexico

109
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,367
All Conchita knew was that her Spanish ancestors it come to the states

110
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:23,487
Centuries before the Anglo classmates who called people like her dirty Mexicans

111
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,559
Are the Anglo teachers who kept her out of a leadership Club

112
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,911
And she knew that racism and ignorance of History

113
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
We're somehow connect

114
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,031
If we make you feel like the underdog

115
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,383
And we take away your history and take away your knowledge

116
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
You're starting from scratch

117
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,039
Conversations you don't know how to even participate

118
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
You just left the other guy

119
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
Put you down

120
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,743
Conceited thought if she could just search out her own European roots

121
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
It would help her fight back

122
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,607
None of this is uncommon in New Mexico

123
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:06,495
What people have been reaching back to their colonial roots and identifying a Spanish since 1800s

124
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,151
African cheetah retired she found a lot of like Minds in local genealogical and historical societies

125
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:18,271
She learned how to use birth and death and baptism records to trace her family tree

126
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,111
There was the occasional Native American ancestor

127
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:27,487
Which was most excited to find branches like the one that extended back to a Spanish captain

128
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,375
Who brought his wife and kids through the Chihuahuan Desert on onate is 1598 Expedition

129
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:40,287
She saw them as having transformed the region by bringing livestock and Catholicism in the Spanish language

130
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,639
It's start finding your family members and you were going well

131
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
I never knew they did all this

132
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
Did it change how you saw

133
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Yourself

134
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
Yes

135
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,719
I never argued that one person wasn't as good as the other but sometimes you were made to feel inferior

136
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
And at that point

137
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,303
The inferiority left

138
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,679
And so it was that Conchita was on the cuarto centenario committee

139
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,239
When they met with the Albuquerque Arts board

140
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:15,103
To discuss the request for a prominent new Statue of Juan de onate

141
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,687
The man they called the father of the Hispanic culture

142
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
And our state

143
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:24,319
And who the friends of Acoma accused of destroying native peoples way of life

144
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
Was what happened to that, I brought up

145
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
No

146
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,719
And was it on your mind

147
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
No

148
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
Was it something that you knew about

149
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
I wasn't

150
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
As first in it as I have

151
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Become

152
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,007
For people who don't know act come out

153
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
What is

154
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,871
What is that this is a liter or Tweety suazo

155
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,991
And Acoma woman who become an outspoken opponent of an Oneonta statue in Albuquerque

156
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,343
Alchemist the oldest continuously inhabited community in the United States

157
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:03,487
And it sits on the Mesa 375 ft above the valley below

158
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,815
Secures a postcard of a Komando Show people when she travels

159
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:12,447
It's a village built on top of a Mesa which if you're not from the desert is like a huge Rock pedestal

160
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,799
And that makes it just Towers over the flat empty plane below

161
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:21,919
All of it a hundred shades of brown from Light tan to defrost it's incredible

162
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,735
Detecting with radios you can have pictures

163
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
Help people visualize it cuz it's like no other place on Earth it's it's not it's beautiful it's

164
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
Desert Inn

165
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
Roxanne

166
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
Sandstone Inn

167
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,815
That's where I come from you know

168
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:43,167
And unlike the Dozen the Pueblos that disappeared after the arrival of the Spanish

169
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
Acoma

170
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
You still here

171
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,639
Each year tens of thousands of tourists drive an hour west of Albuquerque

172
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,247
And then take a tour bus up a steep road to the top of the Mesa

173
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Just watch yourself

174
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,319
Don't get too close to the edge

175
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
If you happen to fall over the edge

176
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
This is the end of your tour

177
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,463
No refunds will be given

178
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,071
On top you can see buildings made of mud and sandstone

179
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,399
The tour guide say date back to the 1100

180
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
Think about it these houses

181
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,519
Happened passed down through the same family for almost a thousand years

182
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,847
So now we're going to be walking past some of the older houses right up here

183
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:28,223
All along that work their tables where Acoma artist sell their Wares mostly pottery

184
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
Sponsor me

185
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,903
But it's not just a tourist attraction

186
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,487
There are 15 families that live up top year round

187
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
And hundreds more like Tweety's

188
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
Google there for special occasions

189
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Funeral

190
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
Death

191
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
Religious

192
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
Fiesta

193
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
We were always there

194
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,567
What did you know about the history of

195
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Your people in that place

196
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,943
That we came from the underworld

197
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
On the back grandmother

198
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Spider

199
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
We wonder

200
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
The Earth

201
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,695
And when we got to where I, was

202
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
We were told this is

203
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
But we're supposed to be

204
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,839
That's what I knew you know that

205
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
We've been there forever

206
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:25,055
Tweety also knew that when the Spanish arrived they did terrible

207
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
Cool things to our ancestors

208
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,151
But she didn't know the details

209
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,807
Historians know many of those details today because they were written down by the Spanish in letters and legal.

210
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:42,207
Documents documents to quote ographer skim the surface of events

211
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:48,095
And sometimes present onate quote as he wished to be seen not as things actually were

212
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,959
Which makes their description of what happened at Acoma all the more shocking

213
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:59,871
After 13 of onion taste men came looking for food and were killed when a state declared a

214
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
War of blood and Fire

215
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:08,575
In that most brutal account of the battle that followed onate soldiers killed hundreds of men women and children

216
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:15,231
Stopped prisoners and threw them off the Mesa and set fires that suffocated women and children

217
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,559
Who taken shelter in sacred rooms known as kiva's

218
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:22,399
They then rounded up 500 prisoners and put them on trial

219
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:26,751
Onate sentence those over 12 years old to 20 years of slavery

220
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,567
It was under 12 he separated from their families

221
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
Giving the girls to the church

222
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,175
And the boys to the captain who just destroy their Village

223
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,503
And then there's the most infamous detail

224
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
In a document signed by onate himself

225
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
It says

226
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,415
The males who are over 25 years of age

227
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
I sentence to have one foot

228
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Cut off

229
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
Is cruelty to the innocent about, was one of the twelve crimes for which onion himself would later be tried in

230
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,935
Convicted by the Spanish crown

231
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
As punishment

232
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
You'll be banished

233
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
Permanently

234
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
On the territories of New Mexico

235
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,943
This is the history that Tweety and I and many other New Mexicans

236
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
We're learning for the first time

237
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,063
As news of the stolen foot ricocheted around the state

238
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
That was the beginning of it

239
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
That was everybody's first awareness

240
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
And at the same time

241
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:24,351
We were also learning that the City of Albuquerque was planning to build this new much more prominent statue

242
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
She has been

243
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
Passed out of

244
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
New Mexico

245
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
Forever

246
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,591
And now you want to bring him back and put him on a statue

247
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
Still mine bazzi

248
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,503
Kanye went from a banished conquistador

249
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,087
To a father of New Mexico that people wanted to put on a statue

250
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,391
It's a story for another podcast

251
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
But the simple answer is

252
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
He was first

253
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:55,327
The first to build a European colony in the region even if that colony was soon abandoned

254
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,167
He was among the first to bring wheat and sheep and Catholicism

255
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,495
And because every people needs a founding figure

256
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,335
Spanish New Mexico made Juan de onate it's George Washington

257
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
Even if he had been cast out forever

258
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:15,295
But it did not take long for the Albuquerque Arts board to realize that one de onate was not everyone's ID

259
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
Idea of a founding father

260
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,671
They could see you at another triumphant statue of him on a horse

261
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
Would be a bad look for the city

262
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,071
Some of the time the foot was cut off of the old statue on the side of the highway

263
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,375
They made a few changes to the plan

264
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
The memorial would need to depict

265
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
Not just onate

266
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,775
But also the peaceful settlers who came with him

267
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,103
And the Native Americans who preceded and survived them

268
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,919
And the exact form the memorial would take

269
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,223
Will be up to a team of artists

270
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:49,087
They had a team of two but right before the newspapers got wind of the missing foot

271
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
They decided to add a third

272
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,951
When Nora naranjo Morse got the call

273
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,511
She was in the place where she's most comfortable

274
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
Her Studio

275
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,375
I mean who would want to be here right in this

276
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,935
Studio with a fireplace in the rain

277
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,031
On the phone was the director of public art for the City of Albuquerque

278
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:12,127
Asking if she wanted to be part of a tri cultural collaboration

279
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,991
It would be the Hispanic artist who built the Statue that had its foot stolen

280
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
An Anglo artist

281
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
And her

282
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,367
At a white Indian artist from the Santa Clara Pueblo

283
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
The call was

284
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
So out of the blue

285
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,559
This was a public art project I've never done public art really

286
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,143
This was with other people I had been working solo

287
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,727
So I didn't really know I was listening

288
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,591
And did you say yes right then or do you remember how the phone call

289
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,407
I said yes right away because

290
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
I open my mouth and I said yes and then

291
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,319
Afterwards I thought oh

292
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
I wonder what this is going to be like

293
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,207
She find out when she showed up for that first meeting

294
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,791
An Institutional room with fluorescent lighting and a chalkboard

295
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:06,655
The other artists wield in a model of a statute they'd already put together

296
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
It was

297
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
Another triumphant statue

298
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
Onate

299
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
On a horse

300
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,663
And that's when they begin to talk about the granite pedestal

301
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
And

302
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
How I could use

303
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
It

304
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,623
Set the pedestal beneath on yachty's horses feet

305
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Right

306
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
I felt insulted

307
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
I felt hurt

308
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
I felt marginalized

309
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Hi

310
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Didn't

311
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Thanks

312
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
I could do

313
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
That

314
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Although in

315
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Myself

316
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,591
I was thinking

317
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
That there was a solution

318
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
That art could tell a story

319
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
That was true

320
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,831
Dora quite literally refused to put on yacht they on a pedestal

321
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,135
The artist went back to the drawing board

322
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
But now Nora was in the public eye

323
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,791
And soon she started getting calls from other Pueblo people

324
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
Who wanted her to leave the project entirely

325
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
In protest

326
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
I didn't do that

327
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,775
And when I refused I got some

328
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,615
I think people were disappointed

329
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,175
But I realize that

330
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,015
Buy me staying in the game

331
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
I would at least

332
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
Be able to

333
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
Fight for that voice that I

334
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
I think was so

335
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
Important

336
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Not just my art

337
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Voice

338
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,607
But the voice of these people that have gone to this

339
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Incredible

340
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,959
Experience that changed their culture completely

341
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
And

342
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,799
All I kept going back to those things

343
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:57,247
The year of the 400th anniversary 1998 came and went

344
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,807
And there was still no plan for the memorial

345
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,111
But the city would not give up

346
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:09,023
All the attention and made the memorial a very public test of whether the state was the land of try cultural

347
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
Tell Harmony that claim to be

348
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,143
So every time the process hit an impasse

349
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,959
The city just threw more time and money at it

350
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,287
Hiring mediators in forming committees

351
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,687
At one point one of those committees came up with a plan that would have restarted the whole artistic process a plan Conchita

352
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
Suicide couldn't tolerate

353
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
It called for a memorial

354
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Without

355
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Onate

356
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
Focus on coexistence of

357
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Hispanic

358
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,719
Then we said it wasn't our celebration

359
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,815
You know it's your celebration now it's not ours

360
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,887
You know you don't get invited to a wedding

361
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:51,007
You don't start telling the bride and the groom you should have had it this way or that way or

362
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
And that's

363
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,615
What what it was it was our celebration but it was your celebration

364
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
With public money and

365
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Public space

366
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,967
That's in a in a city that has people up

367
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
All different backgrounds

368
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,855
The grant was for our celebration

369
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,183
Not for The Alchemist celebration for for anybody else's

370
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:14,815
As far as computers group was concerned the present of onate was non-negotiable

371
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
Which made it hard to negotiate

372
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
In the end

373
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,703
There simply was no single design that everyone could agree on

374
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,775
Eventually the artist stop talking to each other

375
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Instead

376
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,895
They proposed memorial made up of two separate artworks

377
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:34,527
A series of Bronze Statues of Spanish settlers including onate in full armor

378
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
Enormous response

379
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,415
An abstract Land Art installation made out of the desert itself

380
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:46,047
Did gone from a small bronze statue to a memorial that would take up most of a city block

381
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,351
And cost over half-a-million dollars

382
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,911
Requiring the city to issue special bonds

383
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,703
Now the question was

384
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
With the city approve it

385
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,591
Conchita and the pronoun take forces Lobby the city council

386
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,663
Wow unyazi opponents like Tweety

387
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,199
Took their case to the people

388
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,735
You know finding out

389
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Woohoo

390
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,551
Forest and who is in

391
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,415
And how do we target the people in that area for them to call their

392
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
Councilman in

393
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
That's the first time I'd ever

394
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Done.

395
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
You know

396
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,071
Do it like becoming a

397
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
An activist for the first yeah

398
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,911
I was diagnosed

399
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,703
I've never done that

400
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
The statue

401
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:31,103
And also a highway the city was trying to build through at National Monument of ancient petroglyphs

402
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:36,991
Was making first-time activist out of a lot of Pueblo people

403
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,783
Rallied around something

404
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,831
Activists artists

405
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,879
Citizens and City councilors

406
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
We're headed for a final showdown

407
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:51,583
This is govt

408
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,983
14th and now from Government Center in downtown Albuquerque the Albuquerque city council

409
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:06,175
In a series of meetings but city council Auditorium was divided

410
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
Like a pep rally

411
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
Congress

412
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,855
On one side was the pro on yacht A Crowd mostly Hispanic people around canchitas age

413
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,672
On the other side was the anti on the outside group

414
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,768
They tended to be younger and more diverse Native Americans but also

415
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
Anglos and African Americans

416
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,400
And a lot of people or mestizo

417
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:31,008
Explicitly embracing their indigenous as well as European ancestry

418
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:37,920
The city council tried to give the two sides equal time to speak and an hour after

419
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:41,248
Hour of public comment they went back and forth

420
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,880
Bernard over the design of the memorial really they're fighting over something much bigger

421
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,720
And much more personal their place in American history

422
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,536
Our colony was the first

423
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,120
In what is today the United States of America

424
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:02,496
You can't pretend that we didn't come here 400 years ago

425
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,824
This is really a matter of denigrating

426
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,896
The Hispanic people of New Mexico

427
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
Do I have to stop

428
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
First of all sorts

429
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Chicano

430
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
Hand

431
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,744
Unlike some Hispanics that are here in the audience

432
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,304
I didn't just get off the plane from Spain

433
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
Does not represent the best of my culture

434
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
You are not representing me

435
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,704
And I just want to say that I'm sorry

436
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,080
That you and a small group of Hispanics in this room feel like they have to slam another people's culture

437
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
In order to feel Pride

438
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,064
There were dozens of speakers but the leaders were women from Acoma

439
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
Like Tweety

440
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,928
I didn't know that the awful things that happened to my people

441
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
Happened to my people

442
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,048
I told the statue became an issue

443
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,120
I'm really tired of being used

444
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
Taurus

445
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:06,496
The only things that matter in this community

446
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,616
Unbreaking you

447
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,712
Don't do this to my people

448
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
People

449
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
Don't hurt him this way

450
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,392
It's not right

451
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
Thank you very much

452
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,512
Bass speaker IL Sanchez Davis

453
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,704
It seemed like most people were on Tweety side

454
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,520
But the city voted against the memorial

455
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:43,616
It wouldn't just be saying no to this statue of onate and the settler send

456
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
Sonora's landscape art

457
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,992
You'll be admitting that this whole very public process that

458
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,552
It dragged on for more than 2 years

459
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
I've been a failure

460
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,184
The Committees that Define iterations the debate all for nothing

461
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
So when it finally came time to vote

462
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:04,096
All those in favor please signify by saying aye those opposed

463
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:09,728
No they go to 722 to build the memorial

464
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,592
After the vote Conchita Lucero told a reporter

465
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,920
I think our kids will finally learn about their ancestors

466
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
Tweety suazo and

467
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,760
Other anti onate activists

468
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,600
Formed a prayer circle in the city council chambers and wept

469
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
We work so hard

470
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,720
And it just it just is

471
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
Didn't matter

472
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,816
It didn't matter what we said

473
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
It didn't matter what we

474
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Do

475
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
Politically astute

476
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
Now

477
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,288
Tweety thinks what they learned was

478
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,336
But the right arguments Aren't Enough

479
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
You made the right decision makers

480
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:54,272
She's one of several anti onate activists who went on to get involved in electoral politics

481
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,624
She's now the chair of the Native American Democratic caucus of New Mexico

482
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,208
And this last cycle she helped raise money and get out the vote

483
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
For Deb haaland

484
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:08,608
One of the two Native American women who just became the first ever to be elected to congress

485
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,544
Today if you go visit the Finish Memorial

486
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,872
What you'll see isn't onate on a horse

487
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
It's a compromise

488
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
It's really two memorials

489
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,224
Crammed into one

490
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
The first

491
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,064
You can grasp without even getting out of your car

492
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,648
It's more than two dozen life-sized bronze figures

493
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,208
Men and women oxen and sheep

494
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Trudging up a hill

495
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,304
Juan de onate is in France

496
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,680
On foot no plaque with his name and under the watchful eye of a security camera

497
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,728
May or may not be pointed at his feet

498
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,848
II Memorial right next to it looks from above like a huge dirt spiral

499
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
But from ground level

500
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,688
You really just have to experience it

501
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,248
It's a striking contrast to the kind of art

502
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,576
It's really in your face and didactic insist this is what I mean

503
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,368
I think that

504
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,184
Flex Pueblo thinking it's much more subtle

505
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,280
It doesn't articulate in the way we've become used to as

506
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,048
You know

507
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
Civilized people

508
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,376
Colonize people

509
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,448
When I'm at Nora naranjo Morse to get a tour

510
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:20,288
She just been picking up trash left inside her part of the memorial

511
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,384
She's holding a donut wrapper as we walked down a dirt path that

512
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,432
Spiral slowly downhill

513
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
Into the ground

514
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,344
The street disappears behind the berms of camisas and Juniper is on our right and left

515
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
Bennett Buildings

516
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
10 Oneonta himself

517
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,000
Until finally at the center of the Spiral

518
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,048
All you can see is the land

519
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
And water trickling across Iraq

520
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,704
And I'd like that very much

521
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
Because I think

522
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,848
That's what it was like a long time ago that's how I interpret the

523
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,176
If you sit low to the ground

524
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:02,784
You can almost get a glimpse of a world before Oneonta arrives

525
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
It's an Escape

526
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,160
But it's also intended as a confrontation

527
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
Between two

528
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,232
Totally different worldviews

529
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,048
Because it's you walk back out of the Spiral

530
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,584
This is what you see

531
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
The telephone lines the

532
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,960
Sculpture of Oneonta coming here looking North

533
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,032
The stoplight it's all there

534
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,848
And so you see that

535
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,408
In some ways when they came

536
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,992
They brought us great opportunity

537
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
But at such a high cost

538
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,112
The brutal colonization was

539
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
Forever

540
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,928
Affecting to us

541
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
And I

542
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Sync

543
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,536
We should never forget that

544
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,192
She hopes her piece of the memorial will remind people of fat

545
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,520
But honestly not that many people come here

546
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:01,152
The memorial doesn't attract nearly as much attention as the conflict over the memorial did

547
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,968
I think that's why it's important stewardship

548
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,272
Not only to pick up the trash

549
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,320
But also to keep that

550
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,344
Story of life

551
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,184
Cuz they're going to be a lot more generations of people coming

552
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
Wondering what what is this

553
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,888
And that's where our story was going to end until last year

554
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,936
An old mystery re-emerged

555
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,776
Remember that first statue we told you about the one that got its foot stolen

556
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,360
Will promise to decades the foot thieves had remained in the shadows

557
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
Their identities unknown

558
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,064
And then one day Chris are the director of smoke signals and skins possibly be best known Native American filmmaker

559
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,344
Was at La choza

560
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,904
This great little new Mexican restaurant in Santa Fe

561
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
I was sitting there

562
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
Eating

563
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,024
A taco with

564
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,840
My business partner and

565
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,656
Someone came up to me and said

566
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,264
I have a story to tell you is I'm eating my taco and I said

567
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,800
Oh s***

568
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,360
Not another story

569
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Add

570
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:09,504
You know I heard a few keywords but I wasn't listening that intently

571
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,064
And all the sudden it dawned on me I said wait a minute

572
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,160
You talking about what I think you're talking about

573
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,512
It was the guy who cut the foot of the first onate statue

574
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:24,096
Or at least he claimed to be a spokesman for the group who did the deed

575
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
And

576
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,168
The truth of the matter is that I

577
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,704
Could never verify it

578
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,264
Other than I believed it in the end

579
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,312
Chris believe the guy

580
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,408
In part because he was presented with a very solid piece of evidence

581
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,968
When Chris met him for a second time in a

582
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
Forest of pinyon trees

583
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,064
The unwrapped a piece of Black Velvet

584
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,648
To reveal something no one had seen for 20 years

585
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,440
Lo and behold there

586
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Appeared

587
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Probably

588
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
28

589
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
Inch-long

590
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
Bronze

591
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,144
Patina.

592
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
Boots

593
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,728
Of a Spanish conquistador

594
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
And I said to myself

595
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
Wow

596
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:11,200
Then I looked around and I said to myself where the hell am I and what the hell am I doing here

597
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,272
A few chunks of the foot have been shaved off

598
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,600
But they'd made a half-hearted attempt to follow through on those

599
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,904
Medallions for the historically ignorant

600
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,464
But otherwise it was still intact

601
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,792
And still have the power to grab people's attention

602
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,632
The Chris knows the identity of the foot thieves he is not revealing it

603
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,192
But he did talk about their motivations

604
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,520
You know the party involved is not

605
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,360
Speaking from an activist position

606
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,664
And doesn't

607
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,016
Feel like an activist this person feels like

608
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
Astoria

609
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:53,696
He wasn't trying to start a movement or affect policy

610
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:58,048
Just to write what onate did to Acoma men in 1599

611
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,632
Into the history of the colonization of New Mexico

612
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,960
That story still doesn't have a statue

613
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,752
And maybe it never will

614
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,312
But in the meantime the friends of Acoma

615
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,128
Holding on to on your Facebook

616
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:33,376
Most statues in the news these days or Confederate one we're going to talk to a journalist who's researched exactly how those MA

617
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
Monuments are funded

618
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,472
Happiness

619
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,688
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

620
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,272
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

621
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
If

622
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:57,696
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexa's talking to me and my wife isn't

623
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,584
Technology talk to us

624
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,888
It is a creation of Sonic trash

625
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,704
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

626
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,288
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

627
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,336
To make them more human

628
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,176
Turn the living room lights on

629
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
Okay

630
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
Dim the living room lights to 50

631
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,784
2%

632
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Okay

633
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:30,976
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

634
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,792
Makes for a much more natural experience

635
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,840
Turn the living room lights on

636
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,936
Dim the living room lights to 50%

637
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,360
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

638
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,176
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

639
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,736
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

640
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:57,856
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th right here on the 9th 9 p.m.

641
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:05,280
Or story about onate this week with a collaboration with reveal

642
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:10,656
Which if you're not already a fan is a podcast from the center for investigative reporting and PRX

643
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:16,544
Reveal is actually tearing another fascinating statues story this coming week at it comes out on Saturday

644
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,104
And we want you to subscribe and listen to the whole thing

645
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,504
So we're going to talk with one of the reporters involve to give you a little preview the story focuses on

646
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,136
Preterite monuments it was reported by Seth freed wessler and Brian Palmer of the investigative fund

647
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:38,560
Brian is interest in Confederate monuments all started in historic Cemetery he was visiting the place where is great

648
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:43,424
Grandparents were buried they're both enslaved and then self emancipated to the north

649
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:48,032
Brian's great-grandfather served in the United States Army during the Civil War

650
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:52,640
In the cemetery where they're buried is located in Virginia on a military base

651
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,920
There's a white section

652
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,200
And a black section

653
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,016
And what I saw was

654
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,088
On the one hand tragic and on the other hand

655
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,648
Enlightening the traffic part was that

656
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,696
This African American cemetery

657
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
Was not

658
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,768
As well tended as

659
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,048
The White Cemetery

660
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,584
Across the base

661
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,888
So that to me was a little bit striking

662
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,192
At the White Cemetery there's one

663
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
Graven particular.

664
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,032
That caught my eye I've had

665
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,592
A couple of Confederate flags

666
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
Around it

667
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:31,296
The inscription on this wooden cross a little plaque said to the unknown confederate soldier

668
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,344
So I thought wow that's really interesting

669
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
This

670
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,696
White Cemetery is being maintained

671
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,256
The black Cemetery they at least rate

672
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,072
But it was tumbledown and

673
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,144
It just did not look like it had any stewardship

674
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:51,776
I started wondering while why are such cemeteries

675
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
Black cemeteries

676
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,384
Historic black cemeteries

677
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,224
Why are cemeteries such as this in such terrible shape

678
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,296
And why are Confederate cemeteries

679
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,088
And monuments and sites

680
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,624
In such a wonderful shape

681
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,720
The obvious journalist thing to do then is to follow the money

682
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:14,048
So you noticed that there's a disparity in the care

683
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,584
Makes you realize that

684
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,656
A disparity in Keras reflected in disparity dollars

685
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,704
And that money is being spent

686
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,728
On

687
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,544
Confederate monuments and not being spent on

688
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,640
The Monuments devoted to the after American Experience in the African American history

689
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,176
And then you start

690
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,760
Chasing on the dollars and not only all those dollars being used

691
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:37,856
For the preservation and the maintenance of Confederate monuments

692
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,648
They are being

693
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
Used

694
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,464
What Confederate monuments

695
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,256
Devoted to this lost

696
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
Cause narrative

697
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:50,144
So can you describe with the Lost Cause narrative is to people who don't know it

698
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,448
So you make that important distinction

699
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
We

700
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,544
Looked at a range of sites

701
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,104
That tell Civil War history

702
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,152
You have battlefields

703
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
You have

704
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,968
Homes in all sorts of different places

705
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,808
And what they put on the walls and what their guide say

706
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,832
Is factual

707
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,136
This happened here this unit fought

708
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
That to us is

709
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,512
History that's acceptable that is educational that's perfect

710
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
What we did

711
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
Was we

712
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,632
We focused on sites where the historic

713
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,192
Historical interpretation

714
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,288
And what the people there say and what is omitted

715
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,360
Represents an ideology

716
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Not

717
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,176
An evidence-based

718
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,992
Comprehensive approach to the Civil War

719
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
But what represents

720
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,064
Ideology that what

721
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,624
What perpetuates ideology so for example

722
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
Ones that

723
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,464
Either minimize or

724
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,536
Deny the centrality the importance of slavery

725
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,584
In the Civil War

726
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,680
The ones that pump out these loyal slave happy slave myth

727
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,008
And ones that deny any

728
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,056
Any Southern responsibility

729
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,640
For the war that that that you know they paint this did this picture of

730
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,176
A blamelessness

731
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
Vist us

732
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,736
Is corrosive

733
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:13,344
To democracy into our society and I think it's led us to

734
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,392
Where we are now politically info

735
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,976
So these these monuments that you are investigating

736
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
They didn't

737
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,560
Appear right after the Civil War took you talk about

738
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:27,168
When they showed up and what political purpose they were serving when they were erected

739
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,008
They didn't just spring up after the Civil War largely because the South

740
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,544
Didn't have the money to erect them

741
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,872
Our first major Monument here in Virginia

742
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
Was donated

743
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,224
By Brits Thomas Stonewall Jackson was put on the

744
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,504
Lawn of

745
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,064
Capital and that was funded by British folks

746
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,088
But

747
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,184
Monument building really had three main phases

748
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,000
At the the tail end of the 19th century

749
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:52,768
Beginning

750
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,560
Of the 20th century and then

751
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,864
Right around the time of civil rights

752
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
So

753
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,960
Interesting it's not coincidental

754
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:07,872
Into each of these things they take they came about overtime in these these moments of white people in power

755
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
Power

756
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:13,248
Really literally exhibiting their dominance through these

757
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,040
Statues in Monument

758
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:20,416
And which I think is really interesting to make this really good point in the piece is that

759
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:25,792
The current discussion or controversy over historic monuments

760
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,584
This isn't cringe

761
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,424
PC culture kind of thing all the way along

762
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
Just people didn't listen

763
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,240
Cuz they were mainly

764
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
Objections

765
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,800
By African-Americans

766
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,104
There is a history of

767
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,408
African American resistance

768
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
2

769
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,456
This sort of

770
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,272
Self glorification of white Elites

771
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,160
Frederick Douglass wrote about monuments w b Dubois wrote about The Monuments and they were saying No this is just

772
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,184
Ridiculous

773
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,280
And yet because blacks didn't have the political power to do anything

774
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,816
And because

775
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,400
The so-called mainstream media controlled by

776
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,424
White men

777
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,704
Did not

778
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,264
Write about these objections

779
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,104
It could find no traction in larger culture

780
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,176
People now in the 20th

781
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:18,784
21st century can with ignorance tell us well you never objected before

782
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,088
No it's that you never paid attention before

783
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:25,952
And we never had the tools to make you pay attention in the same way that you forced us

784
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:31,584
To pay attention to your myths and your stories by embedding them in public space

785
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,888
So you begin

786
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,728
Investigating these Lost Cause Memorial

787
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:42,592
How did you go about investigating how public funds were used to maintain and promote

788
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,128
A survey historic

789
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
Sites

790
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,432
Sodomy

791
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,456
Go about this first

792
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,760
We had to differentiate between the sites

793
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,784
It's that were

794
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,808
Doing

795
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
Real

796
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,392
Honest genuine historic work

797
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,672
And those that were

798
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,208
Promoting ideology

799
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,512
So we did a lot of our searching

800
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,560
On the web first

801
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,120
And we talked to people

802
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,656
In

803
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,936
The places

804
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,240
Where these monuments and sites were

805
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
And then we went

806
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:16,640
So we could go to the museum so we can go to the gift shop so we could talk to the dose

807
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,176
So we visited

808
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,272
5060 different places and we lost account

809
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
And then

810
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
Once we

811
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
Figure it out

812
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,904
Which sites we wanted to focus on

813
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,768
We filed dozens of open records and Freedom of Information Act

814
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,536
Requests

815
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:38,144
How to local and state governments and the federal government to find out

816
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:42,496
Where this money was coming from we looked at IRS documents

817
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,848
We looked at State budgets line by line by line

818
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
So

819
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,432
That was our our methodology

820
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,480
Insulted

821
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:56,320
So we just like at you going around to these sites with your collaborators set

822
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,344
Freed wessler

823
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,368
Incentive

824
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,648
White correct

825
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,672
Santa's wife

826
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,440
I am not

827
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,720
I am African-American

828
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,280
Will you ever separated in such a way that

829
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,608
You were given a different experience of these sites

830
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,912
That's a very interesting question because

831
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,752
We tended to report separately

832
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,080
I knew based on my reporting

833
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,616
With other white collar

834
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,432
With my wife who is whose wife.

835
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
We would be treated

836
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
Differently

837
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,528
So

838
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,320
The stuff that Seth heard

839
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,112
And the stuff that I heard

840
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:36,512
Very different and I think that's that's that's part of the story but it's also the frame of the store

841
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:44,192
We went to some of the same places like the Confederate section of Oakwood Cemetery here I spend a lot of time there

842
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,216
Seth visited

843
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,008
What people told him

844
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
Was alarming

845
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,640
What people told me you was supposed to be reassuring

846
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,479
They needed to get the pr

847
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,015
Engine going

848
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,063
For the visiting black person

849
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,623
But for a white person they could

850
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,159
Be themselves

851
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,743
As it were they could let their Prejudice hair hang down

852
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,023
And

853
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,071
That to me was

854
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:11,839
Towing

855
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,423
There are people who just don't know

856
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,031
The other part of this history the African-American strands that have been

857
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
Purposely erase

858
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,127
But then there are people who do know

859
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,711
And still they tried out these myths

860
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,807
Either to preserve their power to make themselves feel better

861
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,343
Whatever it is

862
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,159
That's a kind of intellectual dishonesty

863
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,951
That I think is really really Danger

864
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,743
And I think that's

865
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
We're trying to drain that swamp

866
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,095
We are trying to to

867
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,143
Eliminate

868
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:52,031
The gray area that people can wallow around in when they say well

869
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:58,431
You know this is a Heritage and they've been standing 400 years and if the black people want their own monuments

870
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,967
Then they should go build them

871
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Well

872
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,039
A lot of these monuments

873
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,391
We're built with public funds yes there were private donation

874
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Can certainly

875
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
But

876
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,719
Land was donated

877
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,511
Infrastructure was built

878
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,583
And money allocations came

879
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,631
From General Assembly

880
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,191
City council County Supervisors

881
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
So don't tell me

882
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,519
That

883
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
We should accept

884
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,871
Sites and statues

885
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,407
That were erected

886
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,943
In a violent

887
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,503
And anti-democratic atmosphere

888
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,551
When African-Americans were being lynched

889
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,111
African Americans could not participate

890
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,903
In the political process

891
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,439
I put these things up

892
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,511
Now that we can we're supposed to shut up

893
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,839
We have no time

894
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,375
Fake history

895
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,191
And this is fake history

896
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,239
We need to illuminate

897
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,031
Not office

898
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:05,759
Hear Brian Palmer and Seth freed wessler full story on Public Funding for confederate

899
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,063
Monuments subscribe to reveal

900
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,207
There is amazing in. Dropping tape in the story from some of their visits to memorials like Beauvoir

901
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:18,303
Which is Jefferson Davis home and Presidential Library in Biloxi Mississippi

902
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:24,703
And Brian said also do the important work of chasing down how much public money taxpayer money are money

903
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,519
It's being spent to maintain these sites
