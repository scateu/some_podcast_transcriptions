1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,304
We need to talk about something

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,608
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:09,472
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine

4
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,520
Thinking about it all the time is frustrating

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:16,896
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

Sometimes when I'm driving or walking around the Bay Area

21
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,048
Found it

22
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
Bite

23
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,352
Avery Park Ice Age

24
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,888
In a place where each

25
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,960
Parcel of land could be worth millions of dollars

26
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
There are these

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,776
Shared green spaces

28
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
Better at least

29
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,080
Theoretically

30
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
Mint

31
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,872
For everyone

32
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,432
I feel the same about libraries are like miracle

33
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,016
Sticky kid will library for the first time and you'll see it is a temple

34
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,576
Dedicated to the concept of sharing

00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
Hill bookstore

36
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
But also

37
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
Just sharing space

38
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
Eric klinenberg is a sociologist in best-selling author who makes a convincing case that a healthy Community is not

39
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,144
To be held together by shared values

40
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,448
Goodbye shared space

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
Physical

42
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,568
Real World locations for people across all strata

00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,104
Ages races and creeds

44
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896
Bump into each other

45
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
Inform connect

46
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,248
He also makes a convincing case that we are neglecting

47
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Spaces

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
What he calls

49
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
Are social infrastructure

50
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
And this is a shame because

51
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
Are social infrastructure

52
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,744
Could help solve or at least mitigate

53
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,584
Some of our most pressing challenges like isolation

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,888
Correlation education crime

55
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,168
And even climate change

56
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:20,288
He lays out his Manifesto in a great book he wrote called palaces for the people

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
I think it's just brilliant

58
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
So I asked him to chat with me

59
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
My name is Eric

60
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
Kleinenberg

61
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:32,576
I'm a professor of Sociology at New York University and I'm also the author of

62
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
A book called palaces for the people

63
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
How social interest

64
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
Structure

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,232
Can help fight inequality

66
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
Polarization and the

67
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
Decline of Civic life

68
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,888
Where does the phrase palaces for the people come from

69
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
It comes from

70
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
Andrew Carnegie

71
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
And I have to tell you that

72
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,312
I was a little nervous about using that title because

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,152
Carnegie as you might know has a pretty mixed record when it

74
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
It comes to human decency

75
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
He was really a pretty ruthless

76
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
Capitalist

77
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:09,184
You know Titan of the Gilded Age among the wealthiest people in the world when he lived

78
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
Famous for

79
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,280
Breaking strikes in a pretty vicious way

80
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
And doing things that

81
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,376
Probably promoted inequality

82
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
The many parts of the world but

83
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,752
Carnegie was also an immigrant

84
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,568
Born in Scotland and came to United States

85
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
And

86
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,712
He believed that one of the amazing things about the US is that it

87
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Created in

88
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
Tutions

89
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
Where people could

90
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
Get ahead in life

91
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
And achieve

92
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,672
Something greater than they could have achieved

93
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
In their home countries

94
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
And he wanted to help

95
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Build a socialist

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
Tution

97
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
Doubt that would do that even better

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
And so

99
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
Over the course of his life

100
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
He helped

101
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
To fund

102
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,288
More than 2500 libraries

103
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Around the world

104
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
About 1700

105
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
Of which were in the United States

106
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
And

107
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,992
He called the the the greatest of them

108
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
Palaces for the

109
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,112
How the library is carne guisada was a place where

110
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,928
A person who worked in a factory

111
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
Or lived in a tenement building

112
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
And experience life

113
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
Is crowded

114
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,375
Uncomfortable and rushed most of the time

115
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,935
I could go and an escape Oliver

116
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,751
Santa like that the great Carnegie libraries have

117
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
High ceilings

118
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
And big windows

119
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,407
And spacious rooms where person can go and

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
Andre Dan

121
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Think and

122
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Achieve something

123
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
Did they kill products

124
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,855
And and and I just thought there's a beautiful phrase when I hurt it

125
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
It send it

126
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Can the title for the book

127
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,511
You talk about libraries as being the perfect example of what you call social and

128
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,327
What is social infrastructure more broadly

129
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,399
Yeah well it's a pretty New Concept especially

130
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
In the United States

131
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
But when I use socially

132
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Structural

133
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
What I mean to say is that

134
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
There is a set of physical

135
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Places

136
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
And institutions

137
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
That shape our social life

138
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
And

139
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,063
Social infrastructure is just as real as the infrastructure

140
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
Water

141
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Power

142
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Or for communication

143
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
But we haven't been able to see it

144
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
Because we don't have

145
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
Concept 4S

146
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
And

147
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,143
You know what I've learned over the course of of my work as a social scientist

148
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
Is that

149
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
When we live in places where

150
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Invest

151
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
In socialism

152
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
Places like libraries

153
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Parks

154
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
A school's athletic fields

155
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
We reap all kinds of benefits

156
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,807
We become far more likely to interact with people around us whether they are

157
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
Friends and family

158
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
Our neighbors

159
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
We haven't gotten to know

160
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,207
And when we don't invest in

161
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
Structure if we neglect it

162
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
If we let it fall

163
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
All parts

164
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119
We tend to grow more isolated

165
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,471
You mentioned that social structure is more invisible than hard infrastructure

166
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
How is it that you

167
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
Were you able to see it for the first time

168
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Yeah well

169
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
The first time I thought about social infrastructure was

170
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
When I was a graduate student

171
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,527
Doing a research project on a heatwave

172
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
In Chicago

173
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
The city I grew up in

174
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
And

175
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
I was

176
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Puzzled by it

177
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,767
Something very strange in this heat wave it was a disaster in 1995

178
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,327
Killed more than 700 people

179
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
And

180
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,447
As a social scientist II was interested in understanding the patterns

181
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,799
The first pattern I observed was the most predictable thing that could happen in

182
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Disaster

183
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
And that's

184
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,175
Stats the poor neighborhoods the segregated neighborhoods

185
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,479
On the Southside in the Westside

186
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
Chicago

187
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
I had the highest death rate

188
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
By far than and that's not interesting

189
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
Politically important because

190
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,207
Story about where resources go and where vulnerability is but

191
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
Scientifically it

192
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
It's what you would expect

193
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
But when I look

194
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
Even more closely at

195
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
The patterns

196
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
Something really puzzling did emerge

197
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
And that is that there were a bunch of neighborhood

198
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
That demographic

199
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,543
Look like they should have fared very badly in the

200
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Disaster

201
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,871
But in fact proved to be strikingly resilia

202
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,199
They were safer even in the most affluent neighborhoods

203
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
On the Northside

204
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
And even more interesting Lee

205
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,831
There are these pairs of neighborhoods where

206
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,623
The demographics for identical

207
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,671
The same proportion of old pee

208
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
4 people

209
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
African American people

210
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
And

211
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
They were

212
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
Separated by just

213
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,399
Street to the literally neighbor is neighboring Abraham

214
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447
And one neighborhood would have a

215
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
Astronomically High death rate

216
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
And the other

217
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
Would be one of the safest places in Chicago

218
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
And

219
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
The numbers alone

220
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Tell

221
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
Story of what was going on so

222
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
And kind of classic

223
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,527
Keno ethnographer style I

224
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,087
Started traveling around and spend time in the neighborhood

225
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
What I observed is that

226
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Places that had

227
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Lodi three

228
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
I turned out to have

229
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
IRobot Surfline

230
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Are they had

231
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,375
Sidewalks and streets that were

232
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Well taken care of

233
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
They had

234
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,519
Neighborhood libraries they had Community organization

235
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
They had

236
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
Grocery stores

237
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,895
Shops and cafes that Drew people out of their home

238
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,967
An into public life and what that meant

239
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,551
Is that on a daily basis people got to know each other pretty well

240
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,623
They use the social infrastructure to socialize

241
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Until when

242
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
Chicago

243
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
They knew who was likely to be sick

244
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Who should have been outside but wasn't

245
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,863
And that meant they knew who's Jordan knock-on and who to help

246
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,447
Meanwhile in the neighborhoods that had really high death rates

247
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
The silver lamp

248
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Structure was the

249
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Pleated

250
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
There were a lot of abandoned

251
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
Properties

252
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,639
Empty lots abandoned houses

253
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:55,295
Sidewalks were often cracked and broken very little commercial life not a lot of Institutions there and

254
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
And that meant that people were likely to

255
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,647
Stay home and if unfortunate during the Heatwave

256
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
This is a deadly thing to do

257
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
And I realize that the end of that project

258
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,815
Actually it's it was social infrastructure not the

259
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,375
Traditional hard infrastructures that we normally think of

260
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,703
That that explain who lived who died that we can Chicago

261
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:22,175
Chicago Heat Wave convince Eric that social infrastructure was vital to public health and safety in cities

262
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,575
Years later when superstorm Sandy hit the New York area he wanted to make sure people knew that was going to take

263
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,647
More than just seawalls to make New York safer

264
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,207
And more resilient in the face of climate change

265
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,047
You got involved in a competition sponsored by the federal government called

266
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,911
Rebuild by Design in again and again he emphasized the various design teams

267
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,215
The importance of building infrastructure

268
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,263
That brings people together

269
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
But one day

270
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
I was

271
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,871
Taking one team around the neighborhood and Brooke

272
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
And

273
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:59,551
They came up to me and they said you know Eric we've been listening to talk about social infrastructure and how important it is

274
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
And we realized that

275
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Enid

276
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
The design that we're going to propose for this competition

277
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
I was going to be right in line with that

278
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,583
We have this idea for something we're calling a resilient set

279
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,423
I said wow that sounds amazing and who wouldn't want to resilience Center

280
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
Can you tell me about it

281
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
And they said

282
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
Okay so

283
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,055
Set this resilience Center is

284
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
Hyena going to be

285
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
A nice building

286
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,967
That will put in that in a vulnerable neighborhood in the town in Connecticut

287
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
And I we we we see is a prototype

288
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
That we could build

289
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,599
And in cities all over the country

290
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,439
And it will be open as much as as possible

291
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,815
It will be spacious it will have flexible uses

292
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
It will be staffed by

293
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,911
In a Personnel who are

294
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
Aggressively welcoming

295
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,335
The job is really to make everyone feel like they're welcome

296
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
I all the time

297
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
And

298
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:02,015
You know we know that that very young people and very old people are most at risk

299
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:07,391
And most need kind of resilience at home because they might not be as mobile as other parts of the population so

300
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,463
We're going to have all kinds of special programming for kids like

301
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,351
Things like storytime in the morning and since we know the kids come with caretakers in a parents or grandparents

302
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Star sitters

303
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,471
Will do something for them to maybe we'll give that me no access to Wi-Fi and

304
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Computers

305
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
And we really see this

306
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,103
This resilience Center as an amazing new Institution

307
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,431
That could strengthen people who live in every vulnerable part of

308
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
And I said to them

309
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
Wow you know that's an amazing idea

310
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:42,463
Cuz I'm a professor and I'm used to telling people first that their ideas are amazing

311
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
And then I said

312
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,607
Have you ever heard of a library

313
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:56,031
Speak because clearly they they had just redesign the wheel and at first I thought it was a little crazy

314
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,335
But then I realize that

315
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
It was

316
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
Completely predictable

317
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
And forgivable

318
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
Lie because

319
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
We live in a moment where

320
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,343
I so many people think of the library as

321
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
An obsolete insta

322
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Right we

323
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,999
Wait we think it's a A Relic from another part of our history

324
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,047
And that it's

325
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
Not used much

326
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Bye

327
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
By anyone

328
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,727
Even though it turns out that nothing could be further from the truth

329
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,311
And so I realized that I really needed to

330
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
Spend more time in libraries myself

331
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
And to write something

332
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
That reminded

333
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
People

334
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,295
Just all of the extraordinary things that libraries do

335
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
As social infrastructure

336
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Banana because

337
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
They're such

338
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,183
Valuable institutions for us

339
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,023
And yet they are taking for granted and in many parts of the world in the country

340
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
On The Chopping

341
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,679
And so Eric started visiting libraries all over the country

342
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
He went to small town libraries

343
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Suburban libraries

344
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,335
Big City libraries designed by famous architects

345
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,175
And small neighborhood libraries in little brick buildings

346
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
A nice time

347
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,759
He found lots of people using the library

348
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
And many of them

349
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,599
Using it in some pretty surprising ways

350
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,647
One of my favorite programs

351
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
I came from

352
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,231
The Brooklyn library where they created

353
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
The Library Lane

354
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
Virtual bowling league

355
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
Which meets weekly

356
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,959
In the basements and can kind of community centers inside Library

357
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Common rooms

358
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:35,359
And the context for understanding why these things are so amazing is that about 20 years ago

359
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,687
A great social scientist and Robert Putnam

360
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:43,039
I read a book how bowling alone the complaint was like people

361
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
Used to do things

362
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,111
Together collectively

363
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,719
Informal groups and now everyone like in putnam's nightmare from 1999

364
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,559
Everybody was just watching television at home together in the living room

365
00:13:54,815 --> 00:14:00,959
You know I think of now that I have kids who have like there on mobile devices that's like a socialist Utopia

366
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
Fantasy

367
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
Oh my God if only we could have a night together watching the same screen and it would be amazing

368
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
But

369
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,527
In it what what happened in Brooklyn is that the

370
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,343
Controlling people realize if there's all the older people

371
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,671
Who live alone in neighborhoods around New York City

372
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:25,023
And it did exactly the people who would have been most likely to die in the heat wave in Chicago

373
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
The writing

374
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,863
A tenant and they have to do special programming for them and

375
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,191
Some some older people are booked a session and

376
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,263
R1 duarte's things with some actually want to be physical and

377
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
And exercise

378
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
And be social that way and they need to be

379
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,431
So they created this program called Library Lanes

380
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
And when once a week

381
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
This group

382
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Of older people

383
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
Come together and they put on

384
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,391
Actual bowling jerseys with their Library name on it

385
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,463
And a librarian connects an Xbox

386
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
2 television

387
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
And they compete against other Library teams who and I'll tell you like I'm a sports junkie I spend my weekend

388
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:07,007
Ken's following my son around his soccer games I like to go to professional and college games

389
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,567
I'm not lying Ramen when I tell you that

390
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
I haven't been to a sporting event is exciting and collectively effervescent the sociological

391
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,295
As this incredible match

392
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,903
In East New York where it where likely is this group of older bowlers

393
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,303
Came back and like encrusted in the final frames to win the match is amazing

394
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,839
Not so great

395
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
Wii bowling tournaments is not exactly what people think of when they think of a library and probably isn't who certainly wasn't what

396
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,895
Andrew Carnegie

397
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:50,271
What library is being used today outside of that the conventional like you get a library card you get

398
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,367
Yeah my goodness I was just thinking about Andrew Carnegie

399
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,719
You know being told about all the things that these palaces for the people have turned into it

400
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:03,839
I hope you would like that I mean let me tell you about some of the things that I saw I mean first of all

401
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,447
Libraries remain places where lots of early literacy

402
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
Development happens

403
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
And every morning often

404
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,311
Before the library would open

405
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,639
The librarian to open the doors for

406
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
Groups of preschoolers

407
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,759
Working a kids from Day Camp who would come in

408
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,063
I would teachers and get exposed to books

409
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,855
Spend and be told stories

410
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
And you know there's so many people who judge

411
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Can't afford

412
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
I don't have books at home

413
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
Have parents who

414
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Speak another language

415
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,095
And they and they come to the library

416
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,911
Learn to read and to learn to love books and that's amazing

417
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
Probably Carnegie anticipated that

418
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,007
He probably would not have seen that

419
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,335
You know libraries have now become the places where

420
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
People who

421
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,967
I used to be incarcerated, more than any other institution to

422
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
Search for job

423
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,575
To get help putting a resume together

424
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,903
He probably would not have anticipated

425
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,207
That libraries have become the

426
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
Places where there's more

427
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,303
Instruction for english-as-a-second-language

428
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,095
More citizenship classes

429
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Are there any other public

430
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Petition

431
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
He probably didn't

432
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Anticipated

433
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,799
Libraries that do things like you know karaoke hours for

434
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:23,199
Immigrant communities that want a good place to sing together. You know I don't know that he would have seen all the team

435
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Teenagers

436
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
Who comes to the library at the end of

437
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
The school day

438
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
Because it's the the safest

439
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
And warmest

440
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
Or if you're in a hot place

441
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
Coolest place where you can

442
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
You can study

443
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
Apply for college

444
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,839
Or just kind of mess around and play video games in a social way like

445
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,655
I'll tell you I said so so many kids come to libraries

446
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
Two-player games

447
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
And

448
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:50,847
Like when they play games together they did it in a way that was very Collective and very social it was not the

449
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,151
A stereotypical image of a kid

450
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,551
Die in a hole in their is knowing their own basement being on their own they were socializing this very new way

451
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
Libras is doing an enormous number of things

452
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,487
And I really think that we fail to recognize

453
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
How lucky we are to have inherited this

454
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,143
This institution I don't know if you saw this but about a year ago

455
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,471
There was a article that came out in

456
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,311
Forbes Magazine where an economist argued that

457
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,687
Libraries are in fact Obsolete and said you know if you don't show me the

458
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:31,551
Cost-benefit analysis that cashes out the value of the library

459
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951
I think we should stop all the public contributions to them knock them down and replace them with Amazon stores

460
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
And I'm

461
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:46,655
Eunos animes like At first I thought my friends were just trying to troll Me by typing this article it for her.

462
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,471
If I was writing about the library

463
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,519
But then it turned out it was real

464
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,311
And it and it's amazing thing happened

465
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,127
The Librarians of the world United

466
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,663
God on Twitter

467
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,223
And wrote the most eloquent

468
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,527
Testimony to the

469
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,087
The ongoing power of libraries

470
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
To convene

471
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
People and

472
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
They wrote Such amazing things that

473
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,279
Forbes literally took the article down the next day

474
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:19,679
DIY that one of the few good things a Twitter has ever done so far

475
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,495
When I try to think of like what a great social interest

476
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,567
It's it. The libraries are the only social infrastructure

477
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,383
Hardly. But they're just about the most

478
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,407
Effective social life

479
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
The structure that I

480
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
I can imagine

481
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
And it is

482
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,295
It is it is a shame that we don't make more of them

483
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,367
By maintaining them or updating them

484
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,415
In the way that they deserve

485
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,999
Eric is there still radical and Innovative today

486
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
That's what's so amazing about

487
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,839
You bet they reinvented themselves

488
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,423
And and one of the things that so striking about libraries is that

489
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
The local staff has the

490
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
Capacity

491
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
An agency

492
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
2

493
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,127
Develop programming that works for the community that they're in

494
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:05,247
Are there stairs there's no strong hard rule that says a library has to do XYZ thing so

495
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
Library Canby

496
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
Okay can lend tools

497
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,367
It can land seeds

498
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,695
They can lend a close to people who

499
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,023
You need better clothes for a job interview

500
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,095
I can do programming all kinds of languages you know

501
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
I'm sure listeners can think of

502
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
50 things that happened

503
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,959
And their libraries that I don't even know about

504
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:30,847
Has the design if you space is shifted as they start to accommodate all these other activities besides

505
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,407
Some books and magazines and newspapers

506
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Very much so

507
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
Although not as much as it

508
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Could

509
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,807
If libraries had more resources

510
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,855
To to play with and

511
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,159
You know one of the things that I've seen is

512
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,463
A certain municipalities have

513
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:50,303
Recognize the value of libraries and have invested in

514
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,119
New facilities that can do other things like

515
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:58,239
Most libraries need to have a special room or set of rooms for teenagers now

516
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,543
Because so many of them come in in the afternoon

517
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
Did they can quite easily take over the

518
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,895
Maintenance make it difficult for other people

519
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
Also

520
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
So you see a lot of teen room

521
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,735
Unfortunately

522
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,087
Libraries have become these institutions of Last Resort for people who

523
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,135
Slip through the cracks in

524
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
Our safety net

525
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,232
And and so like you'll find homeless people

526
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,768
And people with mental illnesses

527
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,096
And and people were really struggling to get by oftentimes

528
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
What drug addiction

529
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
Coming to library

530
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Sand

531
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
And I need

532
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
Special kind of

533
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
Protection or assist

534
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,592
And some libraries including in San Francisco

535
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,384
I have really been aggressively

536
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
Experimenting

537
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,992
I went with ways to provide more supportive environments

538
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Like like that

539
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,832
Other countries have made massive new investment

540
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
In

541
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
National Library building

542
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Things that

543
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Extraordinary

544
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
The new library in Helsinki is amazed

545
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,536
There's a new library in Calgary that's

546
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
Amazing

547
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,656
And some American cities are beginning to invest in libraries as well

548
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,216
But but generally speaking when that happens

549
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,544
We invest in time to bright shiny Central Library

550
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,848
That you know that that patrons are likely to

551
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,944
I feel proud of rather than in the the branch libraries

552
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,480
Which I really the lifeblood

553
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,624
In the book you also talked about crime as an infrastructure issue which is

554
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
Which was a really

555
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
Subtle Nuance on the

556
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,280
Broken windows theory that I found really intriguing yeah

557
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
I don't know how much

558
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,376
People know about the broken windows theory of

559
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Policing

560
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,448
I'm crying but

561
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
You know this kind of classic essay

562
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,056
This point from James Q Wilson

563
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,336
Enjoyed killing

564
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,360
That said that

565
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,920
When are broken windows in a neighborhood

566
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,712
People perceive the

567
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,296
Broken windows as a sign that no one is organizing the neighbor

568
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
No one has social

569
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
And

570
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,928
The notion is that criminals

571
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
Realized niche

572
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
Could get away with anything

573
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
In a place like

574
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
And so did

575
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,072
Intriguingly when

576
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,888
The original broken windows article came out

577
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,448
It was used as adjusted

578
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Vacation

579
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
4

580
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
Green lot more police

581
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
Cin2

582
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
Poor neighborhood

583
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,128
Shred-it is broken windows

584
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
Theory got us

585
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,480
The stop-and-frisk policing and zero tolerance

586
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Policing

587
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
Cuz the notion was

588
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
If you've got

589
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Disorder

590
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,416
You need to make sure that there's a lot of extra help

591
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
How to keep criminals from doing that

592
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
And and that was a

593
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,536
Is a big reason that we have

594
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,376
System of mass incarceration that's really transformed

595
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,656
The United States

596
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
Sand

597
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Especially poor neighborhood rain

598
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,776
And having spent a lot of time thinking about

599
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,824
The power of social infrastructure

600
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
And physical places

601
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
I found myself asking this question like

602
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
What would have happened if

603
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,760
We responded to its broken windows

604
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,576
Not by sending in so many police officers

605
00:23:53,856 --> 00:24:00,000
But by fixing the damn Windows right. How did nobody ever think of that

606
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
And I went

607
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,120
And it's really weird like how I went back to the original article when I had that. End

608
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,680
And I found that if you really closely

609
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
That the chain of events

610
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:14,080
That leads to this idea that we should send in more police and do Zero Tolerance policing

611
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
Is

612
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,640
You know a neighborhood gets

613
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,920
Abandoned

614
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,968
Property property gets abandoned

615
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,784
God graffiti goes up a Windows broken

616
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,576
And then it thinks going to spiral out of

617
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,648
So hot why is it that

618
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
Siri wasn't called

619
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
You know the abandoned property Theory

620
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,608
This is a horrible title right broken windows is an awesome title

621
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,960
Ilia bowling alone and broken windows it was great like catchy phrases

622
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,264
Better not to justify

623
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,312
Really terrible social policies

624
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:51,456
And in the case of the broken windows thing it didn't even work. So we forgot all about the abandoned property part

625
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,272
So I started asking like what would happen

626
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,856
If we had fixed the windows if we did fix up their property

627
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,392
And when I asked it turns out that

628
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
Someone

629
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
Else

630
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,744
I would have thought about it much more than I had there's a

631
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
The team of

632
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
A scientist

633
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
At the University of Pennsylvania

634
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,936
That had been asking a similar question and they want of teaming up with

635
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
The city of Philadelphia

636
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,776
Which has tens of thousands

637
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
Of

638
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
Abandoned

639
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Properties

640
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
An empty lot

641
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,456
And also the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society which like sounds like

642
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:28,064
Like an old person's gardening club but turned that kid is like

643
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,624
Powerhouse operation that

644
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,928
Helps to control all this vacant land

645
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
In Philadelphia

646
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,280
And they started like one of the most exciting social science

647
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
Experiments that I know of

648
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,840
Happening right now

649
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,400
And for more than a decade they been doing the same witches

650
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
Date they

651
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
Randomly select

652
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Blocks

653
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,544
Where they will make simple intervention

654
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
So

655
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
If there is an abandoned house

656
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
They would

657
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,456
Board up the building and prevent

658
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:00,576
Squatters or being a potential drug dealers are criminals from from using

659
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,392
Property and if it's an empty lot

660
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,672
That would have

661
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,208
Weeds and

662
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
And debris

663
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,304
All kinds of garbage that would make it a

664
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,584
Public health hazard

665
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
They would clean it up

666
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
Motown

667
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,472
And put in a little pocket park maybe plant

668
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
Tree put in a bench

669
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
Put a wooden fence

670
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
And

671
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,896
Are they wanted to see what happened in the places where they made the interview

672
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,712
Pension and what happened in the places that they left alone

673
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,272
And the results were staggering

674
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
They achieved

675
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
Almost

676
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
40%

677
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
Decline

678
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
In

679
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,672
Gun violence

680
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
Around the

681
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,536
Abandoned properties that they treated

682
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,352
And that's it that's a staggeringly high number

683
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Tic-tac-toe

684
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
To get that in

685
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,424
MMS has been durable

686
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
I over the course of

687
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
Decade

688
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
What's more they

689
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
Babe

690
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Hooked up

691
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Heart rate monitors

692
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
The people who live in those neighborhood

693
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
And they found that

694
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,944
Even for resident

695
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,224
When you walk by

696
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,528
An untreated Property 2

697
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,808
Just an abandoned places

698
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
Left to

699
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,368
Become a site of debris

700
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,416
Are people's heart rates really spiked

701
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,232
And of course we know that the

702
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Stress-related

703
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
Diseases are especially High

704
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
A n

705
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,608
App for neighborhoods that have a lot of abandonment

706
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,960
IBooks but when people walk by a place it's been treated

707
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
And turned into a little Park

708
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
The heart rate hardly changes

709
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,408
And again looks like I'm amazing thing to achieve with a modest investment

710
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
In Social and

711
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
And did the crime just

712
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Move

713
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,552
From one place to another or did it just reduce

714
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,832
In total

715
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,648
Yeah so that's what they thought was going to happen that

716
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,488
Fix up one block and crime just bounces to the next one

717
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,792
But the amazing thing here is

718
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
It didn't

719
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
It turns out that

720
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,656
Unless we think of crime is being about like

721
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,216
In a bad individuals doing bad things and

722
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
No. That's part of the story

723
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
But a lot of crime is just

724
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
Situational

725
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:01,152
I'd like if if you had if you create a city with lots of places

726
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
Where no one is

727
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
Is in control

728
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,272
And no one feels a sense of

729
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:09,088
Responsibility a 10 people have a hard time

730
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,880
Managing things

731
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
You create situations

732
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,720
Where crime is more likely

733
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
But if you

734
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
Take those situations away

735
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
The crime

736
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Doesn't happen

737
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
And so the answer is no

738
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,656
I did not get

739
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
Are the crime bounce

740
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
Elsewhere

741
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
It's simply didn't have

742
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:35,456
Service bring your book and I think about myself in the in the city and how I interact with people

743
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
And how

744
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,832
My lived experience in my ideal Isaac

745
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,880
France is sometimes or not in

746
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:48,000
Complete concert so like a flower planter at Planters when I pay for it

747
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,792
Does a person floating through life

748
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,352
I don't always want to encounter people

749
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:59,776
When we live in New York City man I get that when we build social infrastructure

750
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:04,640
How do we make sure we're designing for our true selves and not our idealized self

751
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Yeah well

752
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,760
It's my take hear that

753
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,552
There's no shortage of

754
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,600
Places where people can

755
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:17,952
Hunker down and get their own private space Tuesdays

756
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,768
We've created a whole society

757
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,584
I based on our idealization

758
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,888
Of privacy and autonomy

759
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
Right I mean like

760
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
It is

761
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
It used to be that

762
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:33,568
Family shared bedrooms together like family shared beds together

763
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:37,408
Now that I know so many people who moved out of their cities

764
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,016
Because they felt like their kids needed to have their own individual bedroom

765
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,064
Right I mean it's just

766
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,368
So so I feel like I'm with you that

767
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
We all need

768
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,256
Spacer privacy and in fact like a library is a really amazing social infrastructure and Park

769
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
Because

770
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,608
It combines you know shared tables and programs and activities

771
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,704
With little nooks where person can go and and anonymously

772
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,240
I'll be in the round head

773
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,056
Righto and Atalanta Park

774
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,080
Does the same thing

775
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
Write a park can be a place

776
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
For Collective life

777
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,176
And a parking be a place

778
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,224
Where we go to be like the rest

779
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,784
Anna and have our own time and space

780
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,928
I think you're right we always need to be mindful of those things you know we don't want to force people out into the public Realm

781
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
Hobbit but my sense right now

782
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,048
Is that the it's the publicly accessible

783
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,096
Public round that's really in shorts

784
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,680
I'm intrigued by this idea of them

785
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,240
Public ownership and how we

786
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,312
Convey that I mean I think one of the reasons why

787
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,360
The pocket Parks work and

788
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
Libraries work

789
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
It's because

790
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,480
We feel like we own them when they're done right

791
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,528
You know we feel like we belong

792
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,064
And that makes everyone

793
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
You know

794
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,392
Closer connected also just like

795
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
Tube8

796
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
They treat the world better

797
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
When it's ours

798
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
Private space

799
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
That we

800
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,840
Can just occupied as long as we

801
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
Are buying that

802
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
Cup of coffee

803
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,728
How do we make sure we make things so that everyone feels like

804
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Like there really a

805
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,080
Oh man that is such a tough question

806
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,664
And I've been thinking about a lot you know especially in light of

807
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
The past year we've

808
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,480
You know we started

809
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,016
Seymour Public Li

810
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
Just how restrictive

811
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
An exclusive

812
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
Some of our

813
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
You know most

814
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Value

815
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,000
Semi public spaces can be like

816
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,560
Remember that that video that circulated

817
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
About the

818
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,864
Two African American guys

819
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,400
Send Philadelphia who wanted to

820
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
To Starbucks now

821
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
And

822
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
Yeah that

823
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:42,080
They went there. Tell me if this ever happened to you like you go to meet somebody and they're late

824
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,152
Like all the time.

825
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,456
Right so you guys go and like

826
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
I know that I sat in Starbucks

827
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,552
Waiting for someone who doesn't show up for

828
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:55,136
10 20 30 minutes an hour and no one's ever said anything to like

829
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,440
You know why professional academic writing

830
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,976
Guy but but like

831
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
These two guys

832
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
Like the it

833
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
If they don't get asked to buy something

834
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
They don't

835
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:09,984
Get politely asked to leave they get arrested right then being in this in the shared space

836
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
Crazy thing

837
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,312
And until and that context

838
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,664
People who get in feel entitled and privileged

839
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,480
There's a whole bunch of people who laughed at all together

840
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,528
And that alerted me to the sent that like

841
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,392
To the extent that our public space and are our public realm are shared spaces

842
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,952
Are part of the commercial economy

843
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
They are really restrict

844
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,072
You have to be able to pay you have to be let in

845
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,888
Interlock places especially like in gentrifying neighborhood

846
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Insidious

847
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
Where

848
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,984
Your people just know that they're not welcome

849
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
Because

850
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:48,896
It cost $7 for coffee or $9 for ice cream or they don't take cash at all

851
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,712
They're their only for people with credit cards right

852
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,784
And I have to say like one of the most amazing things I observed

853
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,088
In the public libraries where I spent time

854
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,112
Is that

855
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,416
There places where

856
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,976
This impossible community of people

857
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,024
Who are so different from one another

858
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
Come together

859
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
And all kinds

860
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
Who have real struggle

861
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
Come to because

862
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,704
There's just not space for them

863
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Anywhere else

864
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,800
And in the year that I spent going to the library

865
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
Pretty much every day

866
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,384
I can count on one hand

867
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,920
The number of times that

868
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
The police had to be called in

869
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
And there was a real site

870
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
Security concern

871
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
People

872
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
We know where we're acting out

873
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Towards one another

874
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,160
Most of the time when people going to libraries

875
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,232
They recognize that they are being respected

876
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
And dignify

877
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,792
And honored

878
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
And and I think

879
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
It brings out the best in US

880
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,424
So so I think it's a great question.

881
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,216
What kinds of public places

882
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,496
Can do that

883
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,288
Redken exalt are

884
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,336
Experience in the world in the way that the Libor

885
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,176
And and what can we do to make sure that the places that we built

886
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
Do that even better

887
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,064
Is there any momentum towards more social infrastructure are there

888
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,624
I mean do we require a modern-day

889
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,648
Carnegie

890
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:10,048
Do we require a government to do more to eat require us to just demand more what what is it going to take and

891
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,584
Evidence that

892
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,608
It's happening

893
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
Urgent

894
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,936
Question you know how we going to

895
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
To pay for this

896
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
And

897
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,288
It's true that Carnegie was a

898
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
The philanthropist

899
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,384
Austin philanthropic dollars went to build a bunch of libraries and

900
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,456
Am I close the book by noting how strange it is that

901
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,760
You know we live in a world with these kind of

902
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,808
Titans of the information age

903
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
Who have

904
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
Made

905
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
Billions of dollars

906
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,464
We have a things like social media

907
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
And computing

908
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,304
And who haven't made contributions to

909
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
Social infrastructure

910
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
In a way that

911
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,656
That I would like to see

912
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
In fact like

913
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
1A

914
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,240
Really off-putting things for me about

915
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,312
I like Mark Zuckerberg's use of the concept social infrastructure is

916
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080
Is that

917
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,640
He's been promoting Facebook as

918
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,712
Social infrastructure he uses the language

919
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,808
The 21st century and says you know Facebook is where we'll go for Meaningful

920
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,392
Interactions and yet if you go to the Facebook campus

921
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,928
Menlo Park

922
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,584
Like no one on earth has spent more money on actual physical social infrastructure than marks

923
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,984
It's it's a workers Paradise there right in front of the bike paths in the yoga studios in the shared spaces for

924
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,776
Serendipitous encounters and

925
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
I know that

926
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:29,920
Massages for people while they're coding at their desks like it's amazing there

927
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
And

928
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,016
Emmett in fact people who work in those companies don't let their kids

929
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,880
Go on the devices cuz they know how dangerous a phone can be as social infrastructure

930
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,440
So on the one hand I kind of want to see

931
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,744
The big philanthropist of our time

932
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,048
Spend more on things like libraries

933
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,352
But I also know in my heart that

934
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Enough

935
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,168
Philanthropic dollars

936
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
Are ultimately inadequate

937
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:58,080
And I kind of like randomly distributed to the places where the philanthropist 10 to spend time

938
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,640
And that if we're ever really going to make this work

939
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,200
It's going to have to be through a public commit

940
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,760
I got a major public works program

941
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,040
And

942
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,112
I think it's just a matter of time until we do that

943
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,952
Yeah but but clearly we're going to have to muster up the

944
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,488
The collective Will Ferrell

945
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,864
And we certainly can't eat a rally for it and call for it if we don't have a name for the thing that we want

946
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,960
And that's one reason why I hope that social infrastructure

947
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:30,080
This is sticky that it means something cuz you know what we have no problem paying for infrastructure

948
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,872
When it comes to

949
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,920
The things that we think of is critical

950
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:39,552
The infrastructures like one of the few things that both Trump and Clinton agree that we needed rent a few years ago

951
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,880
I just hope we can recognize the need for social and fish

952
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
Structure

953
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
And find some way

954
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,488
To persuade the people who are running our government

955
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,304
That without their support it will never have

956
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,864
It's Weenie like a social infrastructure week

957
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:59,008
I'm thinking more like a decade at least

958
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,104
A-10 look like if you look at any report that comes from you know the World Bank

959
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,408
Or even our own government

960
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
They recognize that

961
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,248
You know we will soon be spending

962
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,320
Tens of billions of dollars then hundreds of billions of dollars

963
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,624
And trillions of dollars internationally

964
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
To build new infrastructure

965
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,232
Because the the systems that we have

966
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,792
To keep us in the modern world simply don't work

967
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,352
And we know it's true in the case of the subway

968
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,656
And we know it's true in the case of the power grid

969
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,960
And it's my observation that it is

970
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,520
Also true maybe even more true

971
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,568
In the case of our social infrastructure

972
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,872
That they've just been absolutely

973
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
Neglected

974
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:43,296
At an end if we if we want to support the kind of social life that that we all need to know regardless of our Pilots

975
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,576
Text regardless of our income

976
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,368
And regardless of where we live

977
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
That we all need

978
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
LivWell

979
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
And any better connected

980
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,488
With each other

981
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,304
We're we're going to have to find a way

982
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
To invest in

983
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,824
Eric klinenberg book is called palaces for the people

984
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,872

Hanger of a building in there so much activity

1061
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:35,744
They are

1062
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
Running out of space

1063
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,048
The amount of stuff

1064
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
They have increased by

1065
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
30%

1066
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:47,264

Aegis

1070
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,151
We're running out of space

1071
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
Temporary

1072
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,967
Racks on racks on racks on racks on racks

1073
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783

1074
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,807

00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
All-in-one play

1076
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
And it seems to me

1077
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,695
In this world of ours

1078
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,487
Has never been a better time

1079
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
To talk about

1080
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,047
What you wear

1081
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:15,679
And really take a look at what you own and think about it

1082
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:19,263
Your groundbreaking podcast within a podcast called articles of Interest

1083
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,543

1084
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,383
Not just about gas within a podcast but it has its own feet

1085
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,663
That's our announcement

1086
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431

1091
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,927

We wanted them available

1095
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,679
You almost look for archived

1096
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:51,775
So you can just go listen to articles of interest and you can share that and I think that's

1097
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
