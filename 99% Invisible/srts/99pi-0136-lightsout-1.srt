I'm Roman Mars

32
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,160
It's New York City 1882

33
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,464
At night the city is mostly dark

34
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
But it won't be for long

35
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,560
Thomas Edison has already invented the phonograph

36
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
The automatic Telegraph

37
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,656
In the first commercially viable light bulb

38
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,448
He really could have stopped right there

39
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
He was still young

40
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,264
Only 35 years old

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,872
And then he had the brilliant idea of doing something even more ambitious

42
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,408
He wanted to construct

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
The design

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,040
The electrical system that would Supply electricity for those bulbs

45
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
Pets4luv Shoei

46
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856

History of how Society uses and loses electricity

48
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
The Edison Illuminating Company build a power station in lower Manhattan right in the shadow of the newly constructed broke

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
Enbridge

50
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,448
Small about one square mile

51
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,520
They work so well but soon all across the country

52
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,360
These little self-contained electrical systems started popping up

53
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,176
In the coming 10 and 20 30 years

54
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
The grid got larger and larger

55
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,880
Is the grid gruit made Modern Life possible it powered electric lights running water and sewage pumps elevator

56
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
Pearson air conditioning

57
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
The bigger the great God

58
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
The more complicated icon

59
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,560
The more the possibility of failure crept in

60
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
Whenever we talk about

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
Large

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
Designed

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
Human made

64
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,752
Complicated electrified

65
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,616
Sings it sometimes takes four or five things together going wrong but

66
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,920
If the system is complicated enough

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
The chances of something bad happening go up

68
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,856
Which brings us to New York City's blackout of 1970

69
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
87

70
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,696
Wasn't the first blackout or even the biggest

71
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,000
But it might have been the most infamous

72
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:18,912
That's producer Delaney Hall and oh yeah this story it's not about Thomas Edison so it begins with the electrical grid

73
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
He started building back in 1882 agreed they got so big it's been called the most massive engineering project

74
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
20th century

75
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
This story is about what happens when you disc

76
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
Connect people from that grid

77
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
For one hot night

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
In New York City

79
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,344
It was just time

80
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,184
It's time for a new interpretation

81
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,256
That's hip hop Pioneer Grandmaster cat

82
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,048
And he says on that night

83
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
When the Lights Went Out

84
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
A movement

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,008
Have I was a kid in the 50s out of Ben Chuck Berry

86
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,896
You know what I'm saying if I was in

87
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,224
3240 Audubon New Nola jazz artists

88
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,624
The same

89
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
Amana G that every generation

90
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
You know exercise

91
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,280
And it just comes out in different forms

92
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,143
This is Grandmaster Caz and yes I was there

93
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,727
During the night of the 1977 New York City blackout

94
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
And survived

95
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
Thunderstorm swept over the New York City area on a hot night in July what happened

96
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
1977

97
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,367
First of all you have what in in this might even be the technical word for 10

98
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
Act of God

99
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,231
A lightning bolt came down and struck

100
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,535
Overhead transmission line

101
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
When lightning adds a bunch of extra electricity to a transmission line the line shuts itself off at the circuit

102
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,519
When one mind shuts off the electricity start squeezing a

103
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,311
Smaller and smaller channels

104
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
Like how cars on the freeway crowded

105
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
Single-lane when the other lanes are blocked

106
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,223
This is all fairly normal so far

107
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,295
But then

108
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,599
Flash of lightning

109
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
And this knocked out a couple of

110
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
Lions

111
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,767
So now you got even more electricity with

112
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
Fewer lines

113
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
To distribute it

114
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
And it was hot outside

115
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Really hot

116
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:31,263
Which meant that lots of New Yorkers were running lots of air conditioners putting an extra burden on the system

117
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
And now

118
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,591
They started to have trouble there wasn't enough

119
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,407
Room for all the electricity to flow

120
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,063
And so Con Edison that same power company that Thomas Edison started way back when he was laying the lines for the first

121
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
First electrical grid

122
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,671
Started doing the debris last thing they like to do which is

123
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
Turn off

124
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
Whole neighborhood

125
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
1

126
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,047
By one by one

127
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
Okay so the year of the blackout

128
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
Hip Hop was starting to spread

129
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
But

130
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
It was still pretty much a

131
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
A bronx kind of thing

132
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,687
It didn't have a name you know people referred to

133
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
Oh y'all still doing that hippity hoppity

134
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,063
Hip hop hippity hop hip to the hop

135
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
Hip hop the hippity Hip Hop

136
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
Okay Hip Hop

137
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Hit on me

138
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,231
I do remember what New York was like in that hero

139
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,791
And I remember how chaotic it was

140
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
That's Joe Schloss

141
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,399
I'm a professor at City University of New York

142
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,471
And I research and practice hip hop culture

143
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:40,127
New York City experienced a major blackout in 1965 in which the city had stayed mostly calm

144
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,991
During the blackout of 1965 residence treated the situation with good humor and, Roderick

145
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
But things feel different

146
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
1077

147
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,439
It was like a powder keg like something like that was on the verge of happening all the time all it took was something to

148
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
To push it over the edge

149
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:01,375
A couple years before in 1975 New York City was in such a dire financial situation that it had turned

150
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
The federal government for a bailout

151
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,823
President Gerald Ford's response was a resounding no prompting the New York daily news to running now famous headline

152
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
For the city

153
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Drop dead

154
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,223
In 1977 things were still bad for New York

155
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,527
And in the Bronx they were even worse

156
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:24,415
You had neighborhoods that had lost something like 46% of the population my name is Lloyd

157
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
The Bronx Borough historian

158
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,047
And they were blocks at the Block at the Block

159
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
Rubble

160
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:36,959
And the ombatse what was on the horizon where buildings that were empty and boarded up

161
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
Really it look like

162
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Berlin right after

163
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
The bombings in World War II

164
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,407
The municipal government had forgotten about the Bronx and then the youth

165
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
In the Bronx have been forgotten about

166
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
By the older people in the Bronx

167
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:54,879
We didn't have those music programs all those were cut out when we were kids you know we had them but those intermediate years

168
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
This is like we don't have none of that anymore

169
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,791
So they work like a forgotten minority of a forgotten minority of the Forgotten minority

170
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
So I mean you can

171
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
You can really see how people

172
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Enfield today

173
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:11,007
I mean is it's hard to describe you know what I mean cuz that we older

174
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,591
I can look back and say wow we got through some pretty rough times

175
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
Do you know if you were born into rough times then it's just time

176
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,423
And once again my friend the funky beat has no end we bout to take it on down to the

177
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,727
Would you and your friends

178
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,079
Put the sound to hear it's got a tough on your ear coming at you so loud

179
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,383
But you have no fear

180
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,479
On the evening of July 13th 1977

181
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
The same day as the blackout

182
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,087
Grandmaster Caz and his partner disco Wiz

183
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
I've been challenged to a DJ battle

184
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Buy another

185
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
DJ

186
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,999
So we decided to take our equipment out into the park

187
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,655
We used to hang out play basketball in everyday so that's where the battle was going to take place they said up all their stuff so

188
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Side by side

189
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,263
I just remember them having a very very

190
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
Good professional sound system

191
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
Pandas have an hour

192
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,175
Thrown together it all in pieces set

193
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,735
The two groups of DJ started the battle

194
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,575
I was doing this dude combo that I used to do

195
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,159
And one song was a song by DC LaRue

196
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,463
And I was cut it up

197
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
With this other break fee

198
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,887
Repentance

199
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Love

200
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
And I was chilling

201
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,287
Now remember that the hype

202
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,847
Of everybody you know being really excited

203
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,735
And then the record just started slowing down

204
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
You know what I mean just you know

205
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,159
Do not turntable cuts off and then just that kind of situation

206
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
So quite naturally we thought

207
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
It was us

208
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:14,399
We thought we had drain too much power and we shorted out you know the electricity

209
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,823
So we're frantically looking around with checking buttons with checking switches with seeing what's up cuz this is death in a battle if your

210
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
System comes out on you

211
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
But after a while

212
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,527
Everything around us started getting dark I mean windows

213
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,599
The apartment buildings around us we're all dark

214
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,695
Kind of came over everybody at the same time like oh

215
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,119
Generators all over the city had been turning themselves off one by one

216
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,935
And then the biggest generator in the city

217
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,239
A machine called Big Alice

218
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
Turned itself off

219
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,615
Just about everything left that was still lit up in the air

220
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Turned off

221
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,711
Boroughs of New York City went dark

222
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
Turn All the Lights Off

223
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
That go all that

224
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,623
Diffuse light goes away and you can look up

225
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
How there is the Milky Way

226
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:16,863
If people took a minute to gaze up at the newly visible in the night sky they didn't stargaze for long

227
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Because pretty soon

228
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
Things started to

229
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Field 10

230
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
The stores

231
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
Started to close

232
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,895
Like the local bodegas on each Corner we would hit a gate slamming Down Show

233
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,247
Like they knew what was happening they know what was going on at like week

234
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
Be closing out now

235
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
New Yorkers reactions were very

236
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
Some through party

237
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,647
SummerWinds Waukee

238
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
And many same from you

239
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,743
Thelma stayed up in the bars and clubs

240
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
Send someone out to help

241
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
But many took it better

242
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
Age of a sudden chaos

243
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,167
The park was right around the corner from the Grand Concourse

244
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
And the Bronx which is like

245
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,079
Shopping area all the way up and down stores electronics stores toy stores

246
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
Furniture stores

247
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,919
Pet stores I mean everything

248
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,759
Here in corner of 135th Street and Broadway

249
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:12,415
I'm amazed to find a right before my eyes a Singer sewing machine stores

250
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,791
I saw people taking stuff that people had stolen you know what I mean like

251
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,911
He couldn't get in the store so they wait for people to come out the store with something they just grab it from them it was

252
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
Chaos

253
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,983
And it was exciting

254
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
But while it was going on

255
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
It was scary

256
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,663
In the Bronx liquor smashed a steel door open auto showroom and drove off

257
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
$50,000

258
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:41,087
Every other Block in the Hi-Fi store a liquor store a sporting good store

259
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,951
Can people still all kinds of stuff including

260
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
DJ equipment

261
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
Turntables

262
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,815
They want to become DJs they want to begin on at me

263
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
And

264
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
Equipment

265
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Crossed

266
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,447
SSI you could count the amount of DJ's at their work

267
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:11,807
I even like I said I even got a new mixer I went right to the place where I bought my first set of these yet

268
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
Rossmont money in here

269
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,391
And I went by Anna and I

270
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
Got me a mix of holiday

271
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,743
The blackout lasted 24 hours

272
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
And some p

273
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
Including Grandmaster Caz

274
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
And get catalyzed the growing hair

275
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Hip hop movement

276
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
After the Blackout all this

277
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
This new wealth

278
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,543
That I like to call it you know what I mean was founded by people and and they just

279
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
You know

280
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
Opportunity spring format

281
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
Can you can see the differences before

282
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
The blackout

283
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
And after

284
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
So

285
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
The question is

286
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,695
Did they go and seal turntables

287
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,255
The things like that so they think it actually becomes

288
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Those disc jockey

289
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
I think it's true

290
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,495
I cannot rule out the possibility

291
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
But I think it's also important to 2

292
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
To keep in mind that

293
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,455
Basically hip hop history is an oral history at the

294
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
This point

295
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,039
But I cannot say definitively that that act

296
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
It did happen and that it's all my fault

297
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
In some sense

298
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,183
The true story is as well as the fall stories

299
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
We have the key

300
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

313
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
The cluttered World a man-made sound

314
