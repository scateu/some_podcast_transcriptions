00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,280
The new film green book

28
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,072
Is rolling out across the country

29
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,912
I have not seen the film so I can't speak to its merits or its shortcomings

30
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:48,032
The wall people are possibly being introduced to the concept of the green book for the first time

31
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:53,920
We thought we'd we released this story from a few years ago about the origin and significance of the green book

32
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,504
The Negro motorist travel guide to the segregated us

33
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,320
It's amazing story and one of my all-time favorite

34
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:05,952
Is a special bonus in this episode will also be playing a green book story from Nate dimeo of the Memory Palace

Native coincidentally written his Memory Palace episode called open road about the green book and we both release them without having her

36
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
Her the other

37
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,680
And I think hearing them one after another

38
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,704
Realtree

Similarities and differences in our approach to a subject

41

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184

Traveling on time-saving super highways

47
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,680
Futurama's the 1940s 50s and 60s were the Golden Age of road travel

48
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:54,080
Cars have become cheap and roomy enough to carry families comfortably for hundreds of miles

49
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
Racine highway system it started to connect the country smaller roads into a vast Nationwide Network

50
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,880
Finally Torres could make their way from New York to California with the windows down and the wind in there

51
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:13,280
We're here seeing the Grandeur of America along the way we have become

52
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
On Wheels with more motorized Mobility than ever dreamed of before

53
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
But of course this freedom and Mobility wasn't available to everyone

54
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:32,736
Splash of cold water Delaney Hall the year that Federal funding made the internet

55
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,600
State highway system possible Jim Crow was still the law of the land

56
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,952
Racial segregation was enforced by law

57
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,024
And had been since shortly after reconstruction

58
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
In many parts of the north the codes were enforced in practice

59
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:57,312
Cool road trip really complicated for black Travelers

60
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,688
How is this is that a good level it saw you picking me up well there

61
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
This is Curtis grave

62
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,880
Hey my name is Curtis Graves and I'll go in 1938 so I'm a little older than most of the people who listening to

63
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,512
Curtis would eventually become a Texas State representative

64
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
And then he go on to work at NASA

65
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,631
And then he'd become a photographer

66
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,703
What is a kid he grew up in the segregated South

67
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
And for many years

68
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,311
His parents tried to Shield him from that reality

69
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,919
I've often said that both my mother and father were the best Liars that I knew

70
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,735
For instance we sat in the back of the bus

71
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
Because it was cooler there

72
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
We rode in the front of the train because

73
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
Are you could get off quicker

74
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
I wish that upstairs in the movie because

75
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,511
You had better seats in the upstairs

76
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
Of course that ruse can laugh

77
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:56,703
And by the time Curtis with a college senior in Houston Texas in the mid-1950s

78
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,567
He was fully aware of what it meant to be a black person living under Jim Crow

79
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,175
There's one experience in particular that stands out in his mind

80
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,831
He was just 21 years old and getting ready to drive to a college meeting in Waco about 3 hours Northwest of Houston

81
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:19,743
Did agree to take a couple of acquaintances they happened to be white women but I said to myself

82
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,303
Might be in for some difficult times here

83
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:28,959
But you know I had to sold Yuan to get to Waco

84
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
Stretch of East Texas that was Notorious in those decades for racial violence oh yeah

85
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,759
Those communities were pretty bad around dusk The Travelers got hungry so they pulled over at a roadside

86
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:48,159
Thai Diner as soon as we got in the front door the guy said sorry but you can't come

87
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,743
And here we don't serve black people at all

88
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,095
So the three of them went back outside and Curtis devised a plan

89
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
They try another restaurant

90
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
Right across the street

91
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,031
I said to them the two of you go in get a table

92
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,687
And after you seated and the waiter or waitress comes up to you tell them that you have a boy that's

93
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
Driving you

94
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,807
And that you want to know whether he can you can bring him in to eat

95
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:22,207
So the women walked inside and they asked the waitress of Curtis could come inside to join them

96
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
Of course no problem at all

97
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,071
So as long as I was that boy

98
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,887
And their driver I could eat

99
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,215
With them at a table in a restaurant

100
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,543
But if I were equal to them I could not

101
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,967
This kind of humiliation on the road was routine and had been going on for decades

102
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:49,087
Many people wrote Into the NAACP around this time describing experiences

103
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
Just like curtis'

104
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
Don't make him CERN

105
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:59,327
Before starting my recent vacation trip to several eastern states

106
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:05,727
CP and an accord like to report an incident occurring on January 1st at a gulf service station in Macon

107
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
In Georgia

108
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,799
And I went to the restroom to refresh ourselves

109
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
Then found a vacant table

110
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,407
10 minutes past and no one came to service

111
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:19,039
He informed me that the restroom for the color was in the back

112
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:25,439
It seems to me dealers should not be permitted to sell gas and oil and not provide these comfort

113
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
Also

114
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,887
Some Travelers would drive all night instead of trying to find lodging in an unfamiliar and possibly dangerous

115
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,215
They talk picnic so they didn't have to stop for food

116
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,567
Some people would even carry portable toilets in the trunks of their cars

117
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,663
Knowing that there was a good chance they'd be turned away from roadside restrooms

118
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,319
But since 1936 a guy named Victor Hugo green I've been trying to help with some of these problems

119
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,159
Make life easier for thousands of black motorist

120
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,743
State-by-state deed in putting together a travel guide

121
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,583
Listings of restaurants hotels and service stations

122
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,399
That would welcome African American Travelers

123
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,215
He called it the Negro motorist green book

124
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
The green book for short

125
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
Victor green who died in 1968 lived in Harlem New York during the height of the Harlem Renaissance

126
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,551
His apartment was not far from Duke Ellington

127
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,135
His office would eventually be situated near small Paradise

128
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
A famous nightclub

129
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,511
Richard and have the most obvious background for starting a travel guide

130
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,839
He didn't work in tourism he wasn't a writer

131
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,655
He was a mailman in Hackensack New Jersey

132
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,007
But he kept hearing stories about discrimination on the road

133
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
So he would

134
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,639
Go do his route in Hackensack New Jersey come back home and work on the green book at night

135
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,735
Compiling these addresses typing them up and put them in a book for

136
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,551
This is Calvin Alexander Ramsey

137
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
Playwright author and filmmaker

138
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
And years ago

139
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,439
Calvin started researching the history of the green book

140
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,279
He learned that the green book wasn't really the first guy.

141
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Science

142
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
In fact

143
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,887
Victor may have gotten the idea from Jewish Travelers

144
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,215
Because the Jewish Community was also having

145
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,263
Issues on the open road

146
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
A lot of places saying restricted

147
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,895
And it was a cold word for Gentiles only

148
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,735
When Victor published his first green book it just covered New York

149
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:29,855
And he heard around the country from other carriers and other people saying we really need this Nationwide

150
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:36,255
But it wasn't that easy together information from across the country back then long distance phone calls were expensive

151
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
And that Calvin says

152
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,351
Is when Victor green realized

153
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
That being a mailman

154
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,263
Was his secret superpower there were African-American let it carries all over United States

155
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
At this time we talked about 1936

156
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
And so he knew about you know

157
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
The relationship

158
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,711
That the mail men have with their

159
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
Homeowners or apartment dwellers

160
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,623
Delivering my mail so just like today the mailman is part of the community

161
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,439
So Calvin says Victor tapped into this network

162
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,815
Spreading the word about his guide through the National Alliance of postal and federal employees

163
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
A letter carrier Union

164
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,191
Calvin says postal workers across the country

165
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:20,031
Scouted potential Green Book locations and their cities and towns

166
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,359
He says it's some even asked families they delivered to

167
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,431
If they'd be open to hosting Travelers in their home

168
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
And if they agreed then

169
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,807
They will send the information to Victor Green in Harlem

170
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,415
Victor was able to get a feel for us

171
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,743
Of letter carriers who are all over the country

172
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:45,887
Acquire material and names and addresses and businesses for him black mailman

173
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
You got a green book salesman

174
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
For recruiter

175
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
Pretty quickly the green book caught on businesses many black-owned began getting in touch with Victor hope

176
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,431
Open to advertise and hoping to be listed

177
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,991
Black newspaper signed on as sponsors

178
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:06,367
Victor eventually retired from his job as a letter carrier and started working on the guy full-time

179
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,183
Keven opened unaffiliated travel agency

180
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
But hope Torres deranged traps

181
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,303
But still there was the challenge of distribution

182
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,631
How to get the Guide into the hands of Travelers who needed it

183
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:22,751
That happened in a few ways the United States travel Bureau signed on to help out

184
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,335
And then there would be more informal networks well churches

185
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,919
Pullman porters the Urban League NAACP

186
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
The Masonic lodges

187
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,807
There was a very wide varied distribution

188
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
Process in place for these Green books

189
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,183
And there was an important corporate sponsor to

190
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,767
A big one

191
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:50,143
Gas-X extra fine

192
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
SSO

193
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Make

194
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,799
The Motoring

195
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,407
So also known as Standard Oil and now known as Exxon Mobil

196
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,807
Was one of the fuel oil companies back then then actively pursued Black customers they franchise their stations

197
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
Two African American operators

198
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:14,207
And he had a black representative on staff James billboard Jackson

199
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,023
Who helped plays Green books in many of those stations

200
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,071
As well as the White on Once

201
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,167
So may have done this out of a sense of fairness and equality

202
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,519
John D Rockefeller who founded Standard Oil in 1870

203
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,823
I married into a family of abolition

204
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
Who were part of the Underground Railroad

205
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,199
And he voted for Abraham Lincoln back in the day

206
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,783
But I probably did it for another reason to

207
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
Money honey

208
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:46,207
It has to do with money Curtis who had the crappy experience driving across East Texas

209
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,863
His dad operated one of the first black-owned Esso stations in New Orleans where Curtis was born and raised

210
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
It was called the Bootsy and Buddies

211
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,031
The economic logic of stocking the green book was pretty simple he says

212
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,871
If you want black people to buy your fuel

213
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:09,759
Why don't you give them an opportunity to see that they can travel and find places to stay

214
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
While they're on the road traveling

215
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,903
The Curtis's dad kept a shelf of Green books for

216
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
It's customers

217
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,511
You know if somebody came in and said no. Buddy I'm

218
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,839
I'm thinking about taking a trip to Chicago my dad would say well

219
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:30,495
Yep do you know where to stop between here and Chicago and other person would say no say what happened

220
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
The green book will tell you

221
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,103
And it gave you a sense of

222
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
Security

223
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:43,551
Into the green book came to cover listings in all 50 states and even some locations in Canada the Caribbean

224
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
CNN Mexico

225
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,647
They printed about 15000 copies a year

226
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:52,255
Wintergreen head change travel for thousands of African-American Torres

227
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,583
He wrote in a 1956 introduction to the guy

228
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
Now things are different

229
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,447
The Negro Travelers can depend on the green book for all the information he

230
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,519
This guy has made traveling more popular

231
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
Without encountering embarrassing situation

232
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,991
But as a civil rights struggle continued

233
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,319
Some people began to question the value of the green book

234
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:22,207
Black people many of them began to feel that this was accommodating to Jim Crow

235
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,303
Susan ruhe is a professor of history at Brigham Young University

236
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,911
And she says that the green book begin to seem a little out of step with the times

237
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,983
It really took on an overtly political town

238
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
Especially in its early days

239
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:41,151
And there were actually other black travel guides published around the same time the Dead

240
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
One called travel guide

241
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Princeton

242
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
Travel guide

243
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,551
Listed where the NAACP chapters were

244
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
In each City

245
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
They were much

246
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,415
More attuned with civil rights

247
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,023
Much more political Town eventually the n-double-acp made it clear

248
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,071
An n-double-acp said

249
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,143
What we're striving for or striving for integration

250
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
That's their stand

251
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,615
Sheepey built out of their push for the 1964 Civil Rights Act which outlawed discrimination based

252
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
Sunrace and ended Jim Crow

253
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,991
Around this idea of total integration

254
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,599
In fact when the n-double-acp testified during the debate over the bill

255
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,951
They drew on all those letters they received about discrimination on the road

256
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,791
Fairfield to that vision of the iconic family road trip

257
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,863
The freedom to explore America by car

258
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,471
Roy Wilkins the executive secretary of the n-double-acp

259
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,775
Spoke before the Senate Commerce Committee

260
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
In 1963

261
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:46,943
As soon as Congress gets out they're all going to head into their station wagons and go back to their home just

262
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
Its July

263
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
In Washington

264
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
It's really hot

265
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,671
Will confess to send it to imagine what it might be like to travel as a black person

266
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,487
Would you like me to read what Roy Wilkins said

267
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
How far do you drive each day

268
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,911
Where what conditions can you and your family eat

269
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
Where can I use a restroom

270
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,799
Can you stop driving after reasonable day behind the wheel

271
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,615
I must you drive until you reach a city

272
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,455
We're relatives our friends will accommodate you and yours for the night

273
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
Will your children be denied a soft drink

274
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,599
Or ice cream cone because they are not white

275
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,695
Please appealing to them and at the most basic level of Their Own

276
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
Love for their own family

277
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,327
And Susan thinks this may have been one of the things that helped

278
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
Cast the bill

279
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
By Framing the narrative

280
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,495
Of civil rights as a family travel narrative

281
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
They were able to convince the Senators

282
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
Fallout 4 the Bell

283
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:51,455
In 1964 President Lyndon Johnson signed the bill into law

284
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,663
The Civil Rights struggle was not over then it's still not over today but Victor green it became clear at some

285
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,479
That is green book had a limited shelf-life

286
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,039
He wrote in the introduction to one of his guy

287
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,343
There will be a day sometime in the near future

288
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,391
This guy will not have to

289
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Will be published

290
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
That is when we as a race

291
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
Equal opportunity

292
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
And privileges

293
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
United States

294
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,375
Ensure enough two years after the Civil Rights Act passed

295
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:46,751
The green book published its last Edition

296
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
Who actually could you just described where we

297
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
We're at the

298
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,223
Public Library downtown the central branch in Los Angeles

299
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,783
And I were down in the bowels

300
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
4

301
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,367
Force down Underground

302
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,671
And history and genealogy Department

303
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
And you have a stack

304
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,071
Of books are in front of you what are the who they are Green books

305
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,911
They're just little Jewels I mean I just buzzed with this kind of

306
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
Good energy that I just

307
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,751
I feel like all my God they're actually here

308
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
It's amazing it's amazing

309
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,407
Can Daisy Taylor is a photographer and a cultural documentarian

310
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,503
The guy she's holding her small maybe 8 in by 5 in

311
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,599
They have green covers each with a different destination featured

312
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,671
And there are pages and pages of listings inside

313
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,047
There were Beauty parlors barber shops

314
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
Taylors

315
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,399
Taverns or nightclubs

316
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,751
It was really a social network it was anything you might want to do in that town

317
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,311
And the resources that were available to you

318
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,151
Can they see has been traveling the country

319
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:02,527
Documenting old green book locations from California to Oklahoma to New Mexico

320
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:08,671
Many establishments are now run by people who don't know much if anything about the police's history

321
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,815
Some of the buildings are gone and what's left is just an empty lot or a patch of grass

322
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,399
Even either original copies of the guide are rare now

323
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,215
Smithsonian bought one at auction recently

324
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,519
For $22,500

325
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Wow

326
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,663
Look in your if you're listening to

328
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
220

329
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
Plus thousand-dollar

330
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Can you do never know

331
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,839
$20,000 is a lot of money but back in 1936 when the green book first appeared in

332
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,143
Could be purchased for $0.25

333
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,447
Are the Travellers who needed it the most

334
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
It was arguably

335
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
Even more

336
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:13,439
Thanks to backstory with the American history guys for the recordings of the NAACP Red by Ali

337
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207

Who played the part of Victor green thanks also to Orlando Gonzalez at the National Association of letter carriers

341
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:30,591
And Jackie Moore at the National Alliance of postal and federal employees

342
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:47,743
We have another take on the green book from Nate dimeo The Memory Palace that you will not want to miss

343
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
Stay with us

344
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,007
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

345
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,567
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

346
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:08,479
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis talking to me in my

347
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,087
Wife is in another room in a hearing.

348
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,879
Technology talk to us

349
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,184
It is a creation of Sonic trash

350
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:23,840

Somewhere right then

456
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:00,320
An ad man was showing an executive a pitch that would put a car in every garage

457
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:05,440

00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,840
Has their station started to fuss at the edges

475
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,912
The book said they could go to Oakland

476
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,472

But they shouldn't stop in Shelby Montana

481
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
There were no Negroes there

482
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:07,648
They should probably say they're delivering the car to its white owners if they get pulled over outside Lafayette

483
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,000
Should steer clear of whole cities all together

484
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
The Sundown town

485
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328

By Nightfall

487
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,704
There will be a day the Negro motorist green book says

488
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
In the near future

489
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
When it won't have to be published

490
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
But until that time

491
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
There was a bug

492
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
And a couple errands

493
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
As the sun goes down

494
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,016
In the road stretches out

495
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,832
In summer bugs flash white in the Headlights

496
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,136
In the signal fades

497
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,928

498
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,256

500
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
There's a place called powers

501
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,352
The green book says

502
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
Then get service there

503
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,216
And then I should be able to make it to Wichita

504
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,776
The Pact in a food they wouldn't have to risk

505
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
Stopping to eat

506
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
Might be better just

507
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
6th and Topeka

508
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
By the time you get there

509
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,480
Book says there's a hotel there were there should be okay

510
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
It might just be better

511
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Who played Steve

512
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
