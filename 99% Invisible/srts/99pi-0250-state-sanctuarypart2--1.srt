This is 99% invisible

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,264
In the 1980's the United States experienced a refugee crisis

24
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:21,664
Thousands of central Americans were fleeing brutal civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala

25
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,760
They were traveling north through Mexico and crossing the border into the US

26
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,624
We covered this history in the show last week if you haven't heard that episode yet go within now

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
This is part

28
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,160
2

29
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
In response to this Mass migration

30
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,304
A network of churches across the country declared themselves sanctuary

31
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,352
That's producer Delaney Hall

32
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,144
In defiance of federal policy

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,984
Some of these churches help smuggle Central Americans across the border

34
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,312
And offered shelter to people who were threatened with deportation

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,128
And most of the churches did this publicly

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,432
Without trying to hide what they were doing

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,040
By the mid-1980s the sanctuary movement had become very visible

38
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,088
And also very controversial

39
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,160
Here's a report that aired on NBC around that

40
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,512
Size of the congregation at St Mary's Church they are hero

41
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:14,144
In the eyes of the federal government they are criminals who smuggle aliens into this country illegally

42
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:20,544
The government didn't like the churches were openly Define immigration law and harboring undocumented immigrants

43
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
The immigration and naturalization service now known as Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ice

44
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,552
Contended that many of these people didn't have legitimate Asylum claims

45
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:36,416
The agency's Stance was that many of these migrants had come to the u.s. to find jobs

46
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,976
Not because they feared political persecution

47
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
A refugee from El Salvador

48
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,144
Administration contends he and others like him have come here for economic reasons

49
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,984
The young man listed other reasons for fleeing his homeland

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,336
Kelly

51
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
Misery

52
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
And hunger

53
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,688
The US government found itself in a tub

54
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
Situation

55
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,808
They could allow the churches to continue openly disregarding the law

56
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,136
Or they could launch an investigation into the movement

57
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,232
And risk public disapproval by targeting sympathetic Church

58
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,096
In 1984 the government launched an investigation into the sanctuary movie

59
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
They called it operation Sojourner

60
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
A biblical

61
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
Call term for Traveler

62
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
Oar Wanderer

63
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,360
The goal was to collect enough evidence to indict the leaders of the movement into stop churches from Sheltering migraine

64
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,432
The investigation would eventually raise big question

65
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,784
It's about the freedom of religion and the right of churches to declare themselves

66
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
Protected spaces

67
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,856
Free from government intrusion

68
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,512
This is an issue that's playing out in the news again today as churches and other institutions anticipate large-scale.

69
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,072
Deportations under President Donald Trump

70
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:51,168
On day one I'm going to begin swiftly removing

71
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:58,080
Criminal illegal immigrants from this country down, demonstrators outside the end

72
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
Immigration office in Colorado

73
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
Supporting a mother-of-four from neck

74
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
Currently

75
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
In 2017

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,600
Many churches are starting to shelter undocumented immigrants once again

77
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
In this episode

78
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,208
We're going to look back at what happened in the 1980s

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,815
The last time a big confrontation happened between the federal government

80
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
And Sanctuary Church

81
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,727
In 1984 shortly after the government launched its investigation

82
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:29,567
A couple of new volunteers approached members of The Sanctuary movement

83
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
Ask him if they could get involved

84
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
Their names were Jesus Cruz

85
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,943
Install a monogram

86
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
I thought

87
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
They don't fit

88
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
The usual Sanctuary volunteer

89
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Profile

90
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
They look a little tough

91
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,487
A little

92
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535
Experienced On the Border

93
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
For the average

94
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Volunteer work

95
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,679
This is Reverend John Fife

96
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,287
Back in the 1980s he was the pastor at Southside Presbyterian Church

97
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
In Tucson Arizona

98
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,127
He helped found the sanctuary moved

99
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:09,759
And five said that even though cruising Graham seemed a little different somehow

100
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,575
Wicked policy to Welcome All who said they wanted

101
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391
Are crucifixes around their necks

102
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:21,279
And they presented themselves as folks who'd heard about the sanctuary movement wanted to

103
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
Be a part of it

104
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Sew weave

105
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
Welcome to me

106
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
Included them in

107
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,703
Kruse & Graham began attending meetings

108
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:33,055
And helping transport Central American migrants through the sanctuary Network

109
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
They would drive

110
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Folks from

111
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Tucson to feed

112
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
Or from

113
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
Phoenix to Albuquerque

114
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
Or from

115
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Phoenix to LA

116
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
So they would drive like sun

117
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,207
But is it would turn out Cruz and Graham we're not ordinary volunteers

118
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
They were undercover informants

119
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,583
Government had hired them to infiltrate the movement and gather evidence

120
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,399
Cruz and Graham were both former Smuggler

121
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,447
They worked on the border is guide

122
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,007
It's bringing people into the country illegally

123
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
Then they been caught by immigration

124
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,151
And they reached an agreement that if they would

125
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
Infiltrate us

126
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,223
And inform

127
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,623
The government about what we were doing that that they would not only pay them but

128
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
But drop the charges

129
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Against them

130
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:28,607
The Inez had decided to investigate the sanctuary movement using the same tactics they might use against any criminal smugly

131
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Wing Enterprise

132
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,983
Agency wasn't swayed by the religious motivations of people like rev-5

133
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:39,871
Here's Allen Nelson then Commissioner of ins speaking with ABC in 1985

134
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,271
If you and I are meeting at a church building to plan to rob a bank and open with a prayer and close with a prayer

135
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
I don't think many people would say this as a church service that should be protected

136
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,535
That doesn't exclude them from obeying the walls of the United States

137
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
This is Ruth Ann Meyers

138
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,935
She became the ins District director for Arizona in 1984

139
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,775
She didn't oversee the investigation into the sanctuary movie

140
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,847
I meant but she was briefed on it when she arrived at the Phoenix

141
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
Yeah I was totally surprised

142
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,759
In my experience I had no knowledge before of a church

143
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,855
Breaking the law and harboring illegal aliens

144
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
Smuggling and harboring

145
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
Myers says the case was pretty straightforward

146
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,511
These people were breaking the law

147
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
The wall of the United States

148
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:37,215
I'm in favor of skews me where you go by migration but not illegal immigration

149
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
I think we have the right

150
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
To have our laws and to enforce them

151
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,711
And decide who comes into this country and who doesn't

152
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,367
Cruising Graham along with a couple of other government agent spent 10 months Undercover

153
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,183
Gathering evidence against the sanctuary workers

154
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,511
Their methods would eventually come under public scrutiny

155
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
Because they hadn't just

156
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Infiltrated

157
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
Sanctuary movement

158
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:10,239
They were also secretly recording meetings conversations and in some cases church service

159
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:29,951
When they cry for help these undercover methods truck some people as offensive in over-reaching

160
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:35,583
Here's Anthony Lewis then a professor at Harvard Law School speaking to ABC News in 1985

161
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,655
What's the message that bother me

162
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
I think

163
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,031
Most of us Americans would believe that in America you

164
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
Are entitled to a sense of

165
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:52,479
Privacy when you go into a church maybe privacy of a particular kind you and your God

166
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,255
The state was infiltrating in secretly surveilling churches

167
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,607
In a country where the separation of church and state is a deeply held idea

168
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
We reached out to two agents who were involved with the case

169
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,215
Both declined to speak

170
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,079
The people overseeing the investigation at ins. These methods were Justified

171
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,407
I saw the movement as more political than religious

172
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,967
Yes there are many that thought it was

173
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
Under the guise of the church

174
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,343
Meaning the sanctuary workers were using religion

175
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
As a cover to push a political agenda

176
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,951
And undermine immigration law

177
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,583
And it's true that some Sanctuary volunteers were vocally critical of the American policy in Central America

178
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,167
Some expressed support for the left-wing movements developing their

179
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:49,567
In fact there was divided within the movement itself about whether their work should be motivated primarily by humanitarian concerns

180
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Or political

181
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,711
Let the beat got to the point where we decided to have a gathering

182
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
And

183
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
And try to resolve it

184
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,343
But two weeks before that meeting was supposed to happen

185
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,671
The government indicted 16 of the sanctuary workers in Tucson

186
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
Including

187
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Rev 5

188
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,815
On January 14th 1985 federal agents swept down

189
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,679
Arresting 63 Guatemalan and Salvadoran refugees across the United States

190
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,775
I'm handing out indictments just 16 of the sanctuary movement

191
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
That morning Reverend Fife was sleeping

192
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,383
When he heard someone banging on his front door

193
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
And so I got up and I

194
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,247
Went to the door and there were two border patrol age

195
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:35,647
Is immediate concern was for the refugees that we're staying at Southside Presbyterian Church

196
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
Right across the street from his

197
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
The only thought that occurred

198
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
To me was

199
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,863
I got all these vulnerable people over in the church I need the key

200
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,911
Keep these guys occupied

201
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
So I invited him in

202
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
Made coffee

203
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
Stalled

204
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
Every way I could

205
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
He read through the entire indictment

206
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
The officers have handed him

207
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
Trying to buy some time

208
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
My

209
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Charges were

210
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,319
Pretty clear in and they were pretty typical

211
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
If everyone

212
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:09,439
They were a number of counts of conspiracy to

213
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
Violate federal law

214
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,351
Harboring illegal aliens transporting illegal aliens in 1800

215
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,655
Illegal aliens in everyone head

216
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,239
Different counts under each of those categories

217
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:30,687
Eventually the border patrol agents went on their way and Reverend Fife and the other leaders of the sanctuary movement world

218
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
The situation

219
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,039
They faced an impending high-profile trial

220
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,599
In which they be facing off with the federal government

221
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
In the charges against them were serious

222
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
If convicted they could spend years in prison

223
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,303
They got to work assembling a team of lawyers to defend them

224
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,399
So is this true basis as I see it for sanctuary

225
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
It's very simple really

226
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
This is James Brosnahan

227
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
One of the defense

228
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
The first is religion

229
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
And

230
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,639
Many churches many religion

231
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,967
Have as a distinct

232
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
Imperative

233
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,831
That you are to assist people who are on the road

234
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,415
And who are fleeing some form of violence oppression

235
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
It's the teaching of Jesus

236
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:21,119
The defense that there was an argument to be made that the sanctuary workers were just acting in accordance with their face

237
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:28,031
Not only that the lawyers believed the religious rights of the sanctuary workers had been violated by the gov

238
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,591
German agents who infiltrated their churches

239
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
Android secret recorder

240
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,223
And that's intimidation of people who are pursuing

241
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
Their Bible studies

242
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
Eric Church

243
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,879
The second part of the defense's argument had to do with Asylum law

244
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,463
The law provides that when a person shows up at

245
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
The Border

246
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,791
And they are fleeing certain

247
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,887
Specific kinds of Oppression or violence they have a right to come in

248
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,263
And one that is true and that can be established in an immigration

249
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
Court that person

250
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
Is entitled to

251
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
The stay in the United

252
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
States

253
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
That's Asylum

254
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:12,575
As a defense team research the laws they started to believe that their clients hadn't really violated the law at all

255
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
They thought the US government have

256
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
I did research

257
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
How the United States government was handling

258
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:27,167
Asylum applications from people from Central America and I also researched international law this is

259
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Ebates Butler the Third

260
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
Another lawyer for the sanctuary Valen

261
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
And I was appalled by

262
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,639
What I discovered about how the United States government

263
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,711
Was systematically it seem denying

264
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,527
Asylum applications from Central America

265
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,879
This was all happening in the context of a major shift in US Refugee policy

266
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:52,255
Before 1980 the US approach to taking in refugees had been expressly political

267
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:57,375
It gave preference to refugees fleeing communist countries and countries in the Middle East

268
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,983
In 1980 President Carter signed the refugee act into law

269
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,799
Why was supposed to create a fairer system

270
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,895
By adopting a more humanitarian non-ideological definition

271
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
The Refuge

272
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,991
It use the criteria developed by the United Nation

273
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:18,623
Which identified a refugee as anyone with a well-founded fear of persecution

274
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,207
Based on race religion nationality social group

275
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
What political opinion

276
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,583
Even though these new criteria were in place when Reagan came into office

277
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,191
The lawyers for the sanctuary workers believe the government was not following its own law

278
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,799
They thought ins was turning away large numbers of el Salvadorans and Guatemalans

279
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,871
Who should have qualified as political refugees

280
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,967
Butler had been skeptical of the sanctuary movement when he first learned about it

281
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,039
But his research had changed his mind

282
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,343
And so I moved from

283
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:54,975
A position of well this is all fine and dandy in this is the religious thing to do

284
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
But it's illegal

285
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,327
I moved from that position to its

286
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,679
Lawful to help these people in the United States government that is

287
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Violating the law

288
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:13,151
Dependents and their supporters March to the Federal Building in Phoenix for the first round of Arrangements this morning

289
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:19,551
Charges transporting aliens illegally harboring them and conspiracy

290
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:24,159
Play the not guilty they were released without bail their trials were set for April 2nd

291
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:30,047
The sanctuary people say those trials will be a major test of religious freedoms in this country

292
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
This afternoon in

293
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,703
After months of preparation the defense team was feeling confident

294
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,799
They thought they had sympathetic clients a good amount of public support

295
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,591
A compelling legal argument

296
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
Here's a rev-5

297
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Our position

298
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
Oh we welcome

299
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,807
The opportunity to make that casing

300
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
And we think we're going to

301
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
When

302
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
In a slam dunk

303
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
But then very early on

304
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,023
The defense team faced a major step

305
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,631
Lead prosecutor for the government was a lawyer named Arnold Reno Junior

306
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,471
And one of his first moves was to file a series of motion

307
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,287
Asking the federal judge who is hearing the case

308
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
To limit the arguments the defense could make

309
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:21,503
And then the federal judge who was hearing our case ruled that we couldn't say anything in our defense

310
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
During our trial

311
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,855
About 5 subject

312
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
United States refugee

313
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
International Refuge

314
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
Conditions in El Salvador

315
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
Conditions in Guatemala

316
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
Or religious faith

317
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
So

318
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
That wiped out

319
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
Our entire legal

320
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Position

321
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
What

322
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
Nothing was

323
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
And

324
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
The way my attorney explained it was

325
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,455
Well federal judges in

326
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Criminal

327
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
Prosecution

328
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
Have enormous

329
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Power

330
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,623
To exclude

331
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
Evidence

332
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
Did they

333
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
Believe

334
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Is not relevant

335
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
To the

336
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Charges

337
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
Better Bean

338
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
Filed against the defendant

339
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:12,191
The judge and effectively reduce the case to its most basic level

340
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
Had the sanctuary worker

341
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
Engage The Conspiracy to smuggle in Harvey

342
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
Undocumented people

343
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
Yes or no

344
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,663
There was no discussion about contacts

345
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
History or motivation

346
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
One of the defendants was a man named Jim Corbett

347
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,111
Along with rev 5 he'd helped to found the sanctuary move

348
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,927
Corbett died in 2001

349
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
But in an archival interview

350
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,791
Describe the situation that the defense team found itself

351
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,887
He said it was as if a man was driving late at night

352
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
In freezing weather

353
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,751
Is car breaks down so he goes to a nearby house

354
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
And breaks in

355
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
And then is discovered

356
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
And rocks

357
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
Trial

358
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
And the judge

359
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,735
Rules out any evidence that would indicate that

360
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,295
It was 40 below

361
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
His car had

362
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,647
Gone bad he had stop

363
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,207
Went to the only house in the area

364
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
And edit it

365
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,071
Without understanding the context

366
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:17,215
Jim thought there was no way the jury could understand why the sanctuary workers had decided to shelter Central America

367
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,663
In terms of the necessity defense were talking about something very similar with people fleeing torture in the murder in a very

368
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
Contacts

369
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,759
About to rule out the ability to refer

370
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
To that

371
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Necessity

372
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,415
Simply makes a mockery of the law

373
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,743
The judge named Earl Carroll

374
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,559
Died in early February of 2017

375
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:49,215
We requested an interview with prosecutor Donald Reno Jr but he still a trooper

376
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
2

377
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
That

378
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
Necessity

379
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,615
Simply makes a mockery of the law

380
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,759
The judge named Earl Carroll died in early February of 2017

381
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:08,671
We requested an interview with prosecutor Donald Reno Jr but he still an active litigator

382
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,255
For what's now known as Immigration and Customs Enforcement

383
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
The agency declined our request

384
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,679
But he was featured in the news report from 1985

385
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,751
And he describes the sanctuary movement as

386
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,567
Quote an alien smuggling conspiracy

387
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,919
Induced

388
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
Anchorage

389
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Smuggle

390
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,039
Transport and Harbor illegal aliens

391
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,367
The government says that's not much different from drug smuggling

392
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:44,255
Together over the next several months the prosecution laid out its case against the sanctuary worker

393
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,327
Relied heavily on testimony from their undercover informants

394
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,167
Reno characterize the sanctuary movement as a smuggling operation

395
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
Pure and simple

396
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,031
The defense team tried to undermine those accounts in cross-examination

397
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,871
Sneaking details about context and motivation when they could

398
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
But in most ways

399
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,943
Their hands were tied

400
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,271
And when it came time for the defense to present their case

401
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,575
They declined to put anyone on this day

402
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,439
Today the defense rested without questioning or single Witness

403
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,487
Jury deliberations could begin next week

404
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
It is alleged

405
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,583
The sanctuary jury deliberated for more than 48 hours

406
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
Spread over 9 days

407
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
On May 1st 1986

408
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,519
16 months after the indictments in more than six months since the start of the trial

409
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,591
Jury filed into the courtroom to read the verdict

410
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,431
Of the eleven Sanctuary workers who went to trial

411
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
Read work with it of all charges

412
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
8 more found guilty

413
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
Including rev-5

414
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
Which head Bates Butler

415
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
The lawyer

416
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Really hard

417
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,487
After the jury came in I was so disgusted

418
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Whistle system

419
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,263
Now that I have worked in for so long I didn't know part of it

420
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
Then we were so upset

421
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
Better government

422
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,479
In our court system

423
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
Had

424
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,087
Cast aside our clients

425
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,672
With her moral positions and then we felt like the government

426
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
And of course were bankrupt

427
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,512
The system was bankrupt

428
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,328
But the other defense lawyer James Brosnahan

429
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,632
Had known there were significant hurdle

430
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
They needed to over

431
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:33,824
You know juries are very good but they come in to the box with their own attitude and the attitude is

432
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,872
People just can't come over the Border

433
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,920
You got to do that you got to pay the price

434
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,224
Ruth Ann Myers of the ins

435
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
Thought the verdict was fair

436
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,624
The people that worked in the sanctuary movement did not present those people to

437
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
Immigration officer

438
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
They smuggle them into the US

439
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,488
They gave them

440
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,792
Quote sanctuary in their churches

441
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
They did not follow the law

442
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
Next

443
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,424
Can the sentencing by the judge

444
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,496
We really were worried that the judge was going to put them in

445
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
Prison my attorney told me

446
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,336
Take a toothbrush in your hip pocket

447
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
When you go to sentencing

448
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Because they want you bad

449
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,760
So I had made arrangements

450
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,088
With the congregation and with my family in

451
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
And everything

452
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,184
Expecting to go to prison

453
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
And much to our astonishment

454
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,048
He sentenced all of us who

455
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
You were convicted

456
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
Two five years probation

457
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,168
The judge gave them relatively lenient sentences

458
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
Considering they've been convicted of

459
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
Some cases

460
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,568
Felonies so we were relieved at that point

461
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
I think

462
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,456
I don't know what he said but I thought that if he

463
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,016
Gave these nice people to jail term

464
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
It would be awful

465
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,368
Publicopiniononline

466
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,952
And I think he had some some senses that might be true

467
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
Many of the sanctuary

468
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,352
Workers including rev-5

469
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,680
Went back to their communities and continue their work in the same shoe

470
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
Churches continued Sheltering

471
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,056
Volunteers continued helping p

472
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080
People across the border

473
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,152
Many of the sanctuary volunteers had made

474
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,712
Clear in their closing arguments in the trial

475
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,760
But they wouldn't stop doing the work

476
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
The government may have sent

477
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,392
John 5 and 7 other Sanctuary activist

478
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,952
But it is hardly silence them nor stop

479
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
7 from a cross-country Crusade

480
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,424
At that point of the government just back off I mean they must have known that you were continuing to do exactly

481
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Play what they just tried you for

482
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
They backed off us here in Tucson

483
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,848
But they tried one more trial

484
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:49,248
In New Mexico the government charged a man and a woman who were part of the sanctuary movement for transporting undocumented immigrants

485
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,064
And the jury in that case

486
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,344
Found them not guilty

487
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
And if that point

488
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
We knew

489
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,720
That the movement had

490
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
Grown

491
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,816
To the point where juries would no longer

492
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
Sanctuary

493
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:11,776
Not long after the criminal trial attended a group of churches and Refugee Rights organizations filed a class action law

494
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
Lawsuit against the government

495
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:19,456
They alleged among other things that the government had engaged in discriminatory treatment of Asylum claims made by Guatemalans

496
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Salvadorans

497
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
In 1990

498
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,808
The government settle the lawsuit

499
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
They agreed to

500
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:30,208
Give everyone it was here without documents from those countries

501
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
Temporary protect

502
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
Did status work permit

503
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,352
And agreed to a whole series of reforms of the paleta

504
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Nicolas Island

505
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,448
So we essentially

506
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,264
Began to wind down the sanctuary

507
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,104
But even though the churches were slowing there were

508
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,176
The whole idea of sanctuary was spreading

509
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,760
College campuses cities counties even holes

510
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,064
States began to declare themselves anxious

511
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
And not just for refugees fleeing

512
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
Persecution

513
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,952
But for undocumented people more Broad

514
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,280
This accelerated through the 1980s

515
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,560
Has continued up

516
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
2 today

517
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
But what exactly Sanctuary means

518
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
Varies from place to place

519
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,704
Anything you want

520
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,520
That's part of the problem

521
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
Dad eats

522
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,104
He said he is probably a little bit different

523
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,152
Once again lawyer James Brosnahan

524
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
Usually

525
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,224
The local

526
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
Authorities police

527
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
Sheriff

528
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:31,392
Will not assist you in the deportation of undocumented people

529
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,488
In some places police aren't allowed to inquire about a person's immigration status

530
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,304
Or to give that information to the federal government

531
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,936
In other places all residents are promised access to city services regardless of their immigration status

532
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,800
These policies can be son-in-law or they can just happen in Broncos

533
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:53,408
President Donald Trump talked a lot about Sanctuary cities during his campaign

534
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,064
And he's pointed to murders committed by undocumented immigrants as evidence that Sanctuary cities should not exist

535
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:05,440
He's threatened to pull Federal funding from cities that identify as sanctuaries

536
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,768
And he's also promised to accelerate deportation

537
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,304
In response

538
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
Churches are once again shelter in PA

539
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,776
I think a lot of congregations Across the Nation are struggling with what will it mean to be faithful to the mandates of our faith

540
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
Face underneath the

541
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,360
Administration

542
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:30,016
She's the current pastor of Southside Presbyterian in Tucson the church where the sanctuary movement began in the 1980

543
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
Cheater congregation provided Sanctuary to a couple of people were threatened with deportation during the Obama Administration

544
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,024
They're now having conversations about whether that work will expand in the next few years

545
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:45,120
I mean I can't ignore the fact that my predecessor John 5 was indicted

546
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,704
For doing the work that I'm doing right now

547
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,264
And that he was looking at 10 years in prison

548
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,312
I try not to think about

549
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,128
But you can't ignore that

550
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
Since 2011

551
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,968
Churches have had some protected status

552
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,992
Sanctuary

553
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,320
And that year Immigration and Customs Enforcement

554
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
Under President Obama

555
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Issued a memo

556
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,208
It said that some sensitive locations

557
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,000
What's require special consideration

558
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
My immigration

559
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,840
The government has said we won't

560
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,888
Enter into those sensitive locations

561
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,496
Dream situation or we have higher levels

562
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
Approval

563
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,336
Hello sensitive locations are houses of worship

564
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Hospitals in

565
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
School

566
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,712
But that practice isn't codified into law and could easily change

567
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,856
Recently there have been reports of immigration agents targeting undocumented people in hospitals and schools

568
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Churches

569
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
Might also be vulnerable

570
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,976
That's going to have to be worked out

571
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,280
Through a number of

572
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,120
Of institutional decisions as well as Court decisions

573
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
Well well into the future

574
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,496
What's going to be the result

575
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
5 years

576
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,568

Between the beats

591
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,728
Bongs and chatter of our devices

592
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,312
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

593
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
If

594
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:08,736
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

595
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,832
All hearing that voice

596
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
Technology talk to us

597
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,672
It is a creation of Sonic trash

598
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,744
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

599
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,328
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

600
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,376
To make them more human

601
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,216

602
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008

Okay

606
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:42,016
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

607
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,832
Makes for a much more natural experience

608
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,880
Turn the living room lights on

609
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,952

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

Now I need to clear my name

644
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,944
