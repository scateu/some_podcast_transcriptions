I'm Roman Mars

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,232
If I ask you to think of the most famous architect in American history even if you don't think you know anything at all about architecture

32
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
I bet you could take a guess

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
And I bet your guess would be

34
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Right

35
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
Frank Lloyd Wright Frank Lloyd Wright perhaps the greatest architect of the 20th century

36
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,288
Has been called the Pacesetter of modern-day architect

37
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
One of the most extraordinary men of all time for dinner

38
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,016
Patience and new ideas in the field of architecture

39
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,672
Frank Lloyd Wright left a legacy of some of the most iconic and gorgeous buildings in the United States

40
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,000
Like the spiraling Guggenheim Museum in New York

41
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,560
The falling water house in Pennsylvania which

42
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Straddles a waterfall

43
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,144
And the futuristic Marin Civic Center

44
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,960
Which is the backdrop for Gattaca which is an awesome movie

45
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
And that is producer Avery trufelman

46
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
By the end of his career

47
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,152
Wright was on a level of celebrity usually reserved for actors and rock stars

48
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
The household name

49
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
And he was on late night talk shows

50
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,576
Some quarters of denounce right as an impractical Visionary in the pompous windbag

51
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
Yeah

52
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
How how do you feel about sex

53
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,488
Mr. right

54
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
The rape wasn't just known for being a genius architect

55
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,680
He made headlines because he was a character

56
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,264
You up and wear this outfit that included a Flowbee cape and a hat

57
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Kane

58
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,896
He wrote Manifesto is launched insulted other Architects and loudly critique politicians

59
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
Religion and Society

60
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,504
Declared himself the greatest architect who ever lived

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
He was punishing

62
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,512
I chose honest arrogance

63
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,632
And Frank Lloyd Wright had this wildly scandalous private

64
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
There were suits against

65
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
Property

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
Divorce the raw materials are big

67
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
Spicy headlines

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
Frank Lloyd Wright was a darling of The Sensational press

69
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
But

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
This bombastic character ultimately

71
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Change the field of

72
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,576
And introduced a new philosophy of building

73
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,672
Deformity of right iconic and famous structures were completed

74
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
Before falling water

75
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
For the Guggenheim

76
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
For the Marines

77
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,328
His most significant contribution to our everyday life

78
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
With something much

79
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
More modest

80
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
Small sturdy inexpensive

81
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,960
And most importantly

82
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,056
Very beautiful house design with the American working class in mind

83
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
And it all started

84
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
With a journal

85
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
From Milwaukee

86
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,528
1934a Milwaukee Journal reporter

87
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Are named Herbert Jacob

88
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,624
Was assigned to take a drive over to Spring Green

89
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
In Central Wisconsin

90
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Who told to write about

91
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Taliesin

92
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,768
Frank Lloyd Wright's home and Studio

93
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,327
Jacob's didn't really know anything about architect

94
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,935
And at that particular time he wasn't really interested in learning anything about it

95
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
Because Herbert Jacobs had other things on his mind

96
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
And that November

97
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
1934

98
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,127
His wife was very very pregnant

99
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,687
The night before his reporting trip

100
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,223
He brought her to the hospital

101
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
They stayed up with her until dawn

102
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
The nurse is a shared Herbert that he

103
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
We could go on his reporting trip

104
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Missing my birth

105
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
And so

106
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
She set out that morning

107
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Alone

108
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
.

109
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
Completely unprepared

110
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,887
He drove 120 miles to the chill gray Wisconsin Countryside for his assignment

111
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
To meet with Frank Lloyd Wright

112
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,287
Wright was 67 in 1934

113
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,847
Couldn't have cared less about his appointment with

114
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
Herbert Jacobs of the Milwaukee Journal

115
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Actually

116
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
Write forgot all about it

117
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Which wasn't unusual

118
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
He was known to blow off journalists

119
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:16,415
When Jacobs arrived at Frank Lloyd Wright's compound completely distracted by thoughts of his wife and their baby

120
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,487
You learn that the architect was actually on his way out the door

121
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,559
They got to talk for just over 10 minutes before right left

122
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Abruptly saying

123
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Some of the boys will talk to you now

124
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
The boys

125
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
Where Frank Lloyd Wright

126
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Princesses

127
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,519
They've come to him from all over the world

128
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,615
And they're part of a fellowship program that right established at his home and Studio

129
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
ICampus he called Tallahassee

130
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
Taliesin

131
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
El Welch word meaning shining brow

132
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,623
Welsh because it was built on land settled by his family were farmers from Wales

133
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
But The Shining brow

134
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
Also has to do with rights building place

135
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,071
Taliesin actually is built on the brow

136
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Just like your

137
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
Brow of your head

138
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,959
The main Taliesin building curls around the side of a hill

139
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Almost like a crown

140
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,311
He felt that you should never build on top of a hill

141
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,615
Because I've destroyed the Integrity of the Hill

142
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
This is Floyd Hamlin

143
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Is an architect

144
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
Exit Tallahassee

145
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
Also

146
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,551
Part of the faculty of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture and

147
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
I've been here since starting

148
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
As an apprentice back in

149
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
1987

150
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,743
Hamblen works and lives at Taliesin full-time

151
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
Kieron Frank Lloyd Wright's family land

152
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,351
We're right used to play at the boy

153
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,679
So yeah where it where are we now where are we we are

154
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
This is

155
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,519
Just outside of Spring Green Wisconsin

156
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
It's a very beautiful green

157
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,847
Valley with Rolling Hills

158
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
So he

159
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
Spent a lot of his

160
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,175
His Summers

161
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
Working this land so he's very

162
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Familiar

163
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
The landscape

164
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
And this

165
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Connection

166
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
With the outdoors

167
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
Was really formative for right

168
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,535
He thought that architecture should help people live harmoniously with their environment

169
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Rather than

170
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
Shield them from it

171
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
The house

172
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
To become part of nature

173
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
If it was made with local materials and had

174
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,007
Big windows and was oriented for

175
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
Just the right amount

176
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Sunlight

177
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
The Orion

178
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
The house

179
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Just wright

180
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
So that you've taken

181
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
Advantage of what Nature has

182
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
The offering

183
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,503
You're living with nature rather than trying to

184
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
The fight against it

185
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
You know living on the brow of the Hill

186
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
Knot on top of that

187
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,159
It's all folded into a concept

188
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
Frank Lloyd Wright called

189
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
Organic architecture

190
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,047
You wanted to spread this gospel to the Next Generation

191
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
Which is why he returned to the valley he knew as a boy

192
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Established

193
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
The Taliesin Fellowship

194
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:40,543
Fellowship with the thing that the Milwaukee Journal wanted Herbert Jacobs to cover a news article

195
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,895
When Jacobs drove into Taliesin that morning in 1934

196
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
The fellowship had been going on for two years

197
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,759
It was hard for the public to wrap their minds around

198
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
Including this NBC announcer

199
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
King is Frank Lloyd Wright

200
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,959
They are such a right as the fingers of my hand

201
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,567
The apprentices had to pay $1,100 a year to attend the Taliesin Fellowship

202
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
Nearly 20 grand today

203
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,175
And it wasn't like an accredited institution or anything

204
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
Students had to do a lot of grunt work

205
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Baling hay

206
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,295
Diamond fields in making meals

207
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,367
But they got to learn Frank Lloyd Wright's philosophy of architect

208
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
And live with them

209
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
And work with them

210
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:32,255
Even though often times has meant serving as an unpaid labor force

211
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,815
When Jacobs was getting his tour of Taliesin

212
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,607
He described the apprentices as

213
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,935
Rather long-haired smiling and polite young men

214
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,263
Who tried their best to explain to him what organic architecture

215
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Sure means

216
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
Organic architecture is

217
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,919
Architecture of its time and of its place

218
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
You're not trying to make it

219
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
Look like something

220
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
But it's not

221
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,319
Write thought that there should be no wallpaper to cover things up

222
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
No paint no plaster

223
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
Would should look like what

224
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
Stone should look like Stone

225
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,487
Concrete should look like concrete

226
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
When Frank Lloyd Wright

227
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,047
Worked with

228
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
Why would he like

229
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,191
To leave the edge of the plywood exposed so that you saw those layers

230
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
Aaron that became part of the

231
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
Ornament

232
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Detail

233
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
Which was different from

234
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,407
Really traditional European style architects

235
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
Roco gold ornaments

236
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
Clawfoot chairs

237
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
Parlors full of knick knacks

238
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
Just think of Victorian houses

239
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
Stuffed with lots of tiny rooms

240
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
Covered in bright paint

241
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Macy curtains

242
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,279
This idea of organic architecture wasn't just a break from these tradition

243
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,119
It was a break from new trends in modern architecture 2

244
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:46,239
Cities all over the world we're building huge boxy glass and steel structures

245
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,823
Designed to be hypersleep machines for living and working

246
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,895
Wright explains that these were simply not comfortable

247
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919
Bremen animals

248
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,735
I like goldfish and a globe

249
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,855
And these houses that are so classified as they know how they're not sensible it's

250
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Houston

251
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
Privilege Center

252
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
An abuse of material

253
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,559
Frank Lloyd Wright took the traditional old materials and put them into Sleek modern forms

254
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,631
Is organic architecture was a new style

255
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
Born in the United States

256
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
An organic

257
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
Picture of a new sense

258
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
What constitutes

259
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,335
Humanity under harmonious condition

260
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
A harmonious

261
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,455
Pleasant Register living I'm on his way to living in

262
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
But Frank Lloyd Wright didn't

263
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Playing this

264
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
Grand philosophy

265
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
To the journalist

266
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Herbert Jacobs

267
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
Because right wasn't there

268
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,719
The apprentices did the best I could but again

269
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,767
Jacob's was very distracted

270
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,327
And was only thinking of his wife in the hospital

271
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,911
He thanked the two young man who showed him around Taliesin

272
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
And got back in his car

273
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
Jacob's ladder rope

274
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
Finally I started back to Milwaukee

275
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,359
Learning on the way to a telephone call to the hospital

276
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,175
That I had become a father at about 11

277
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Clock that morning

278
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
At the very moment

279
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
When I was interviewing right

280
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
Herbert Jacobs

281
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,367
His wife Kathryn and their new daughter

282
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
Lived in Milwaukee for 2 more years

283
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
On his reporter salary of $20 a week

284
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
This was in the mid-30s

285
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
The Great Depression

286
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:19,423
So when Herbert Jacobs was offered a slightly higher paying job with a paper in the state capital of Madison

287
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
The family moved by the way

288
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,359
Finally got the Madison I couldn't find anything within our price range in a newspaper man's Place rains it was

289
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,919
I would we figured would be nice to live in

290
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
This is the voice of Herbert Jacobs himself

291
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,039
From a 1956 NBC interview

292
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,135
We can Catherine move to Madison they didn't see any houses they like

293
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
Or that they can afford

294
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,839
Do something for us

295
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:52,191
Jacob's didn't really remember much about his first visit to Taliesin two years before

296
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
Any murmured something along the lines of

297
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
Very interesting

298
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,567
Which is wife's cousin took as a yes

299
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,175
But he made an appointment for us to go out there and we went along with that idea

300
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,735
On the way house we were

301
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,527
My wife and I were trying to think

302
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
What is it The Weeknd

303
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,367
Jealous great man

304
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,183
Architecture Rich Prime

305
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
Hercules

306
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
Grease Monkeys

307
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:24,191
In the past when Frank Lloyd Wright had designed private homes they had not been for people

308
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,983
Like Herbert and Katherine Jacob's

309
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
Write a design

310
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
Gorgeous wide homes

311
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
Broad rooves

312
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
Expansive living room

313
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
You're welcome

314
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
The constructions were master

315
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
It works

316
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
New expensive

317
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
So we put it as a sort of challenge

318
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,671
What the country needs is a decent $5,000 house can you build one

319
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,999
In today's money $5,000 is about $85,000

320
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,839
That's a pretty reasonably priced house in most real estate market

321
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,615
Millwright had long wanted to make a more democratic form of housing

322
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
Even early in his

323
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
Given playing around with inexpensive methods

324
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
The building and other stuff

325
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,087
I need a lot of Concepts that had been scheming around urban planning

326
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
But now

327
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
Write have a chance to make some of his Concepts

328
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
A reality

329
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
She had the Willing science

330
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
And

331
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
He had time on his head

332
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,375
In 1936 he was in a bit of a slump in his career

333
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,447
People can afford fancy big new homes

334
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,495
Again it was The Depression

335
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,287
A number of big projects have been

336
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:36,127
Cancelled and also write had already been practicing for decades

337
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
He was slowly getting written off as a has-been

338
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,271
And then in comes this young open-minded couples

339
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,319
Wright could tell them his philosophy

340
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,391
And teach them how to live well for good architecture

341
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,231
Do you really want a $5,000 house

342
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,071
She said most people want a $10,000 house for 5,000

343
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,399
Are you willing to give up the things that you have to give up

344
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,983
Mr. Wright made a list of the things that the Jacobs would have to do without

345
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,055
Really wanted a $5,000 house

346
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
Tile bathrooms

347
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,943
Extra trim finishing things like that are you willing to give those up

348
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,271
We didn't know anything about it we said sure that's okay with us

349
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,367
Herbert and Katherine Jacob's didn't know it at the time

350
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,695
But that modest little house that Frank Lloyd Wright was

351
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
To build for them

352
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
Would be the most

353
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
Classical expression

354
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
Of his ideology

355
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,167
The Jacobs would own the first house in a movement that right called

356
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Usonia

357
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,031
The house that Herbert Jacobs built was the first of the usonian houses

358
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:47,295
Usonia was Frank Lloyd Wright's name for the United States of North America

359
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,647
In Wright's vision usonia would be a country full of modest

360
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
Well made

361
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,719
Beautiful comfortable little house

362
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
Is that the working class could afford

363
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
These usonian homes

364
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
Woodin

365
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Spire

366
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,887
Educate and write believe

367
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Create a new culture

368
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
For all Americans

369
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,335
I believe now people are going to know what constitutes good architecture

370
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,895
And of course good living has to go with it

371
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
Good Conduct also

372
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,015
Good dressing to because you wouldn't dress

373
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,623
Download and vogelweh and a quiet and beautiful room

374
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
All is good things

375
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:31,071
Are dependent Wireless one on the other and add up to something that we call culture

376
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,631
It's only by a natural girls

377
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Who can attend Coachella

378
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
Write believe the way to build a better American culture was not on mass not in apartment buildings or cookie

379
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,335
Cookie cutter development

380
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,895
It was to be catered to the individual

381
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,479
Kosher not for the cross country as an individual

382
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
Sing

383
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,319
And that's what our forefathers

384
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Struck

385
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,391
Band-Aid that

386
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
The individual is

387
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
Shower

388
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
Wichita Frank Lloyd Wright

389
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,303
I meant that the masses should be unmasked

390
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,839
You should spread out

391
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Away from the city

392
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
Weather city of course is a

393
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Thing of the past

394
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,287
There was a time during the Middle Ages

395
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
When

396
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,383
Said it was the only source of culture

397
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,711
There's no way of acquiring

398
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,551
This thing we call culture except by direct contact

399
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,879
That wasn't true anymore

400
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,975
People were connected to culture through radio and telephones and Automobiles

401
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
They have

402
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
Transportation

403
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Speed

404
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,863
Listening this

405
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Cherry where

406
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
Using now

407
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,727
It's no longer essential

408
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
For people to crowd together anyway

409
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,359
These were all parts of Frank Lloyd Wright

410
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
Vision for America

411
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,479
And this would start to become reality in 1936

412
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
With the Jacobs

413
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,831
Which would come to be known as Jacobs one

414
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Or

415
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
Usonia 1

416
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
Jacob's house was

417
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,487
One of the first ones built there was this

418
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,815
Was just left wide open Farmland when it was built out here

419
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
This is Bill Martinelli

420
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
Manager of usonia 1

421
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:14,495
It's in a Suburban Street at side of Madison now lined with little suburban houses

422
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,799
But usonia one really stands out

423
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,359
Even if you don't know what it is and you're just driving by

424
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
Because I'm a street

425
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,223
It almost looks like a beautiful wooden wall

426
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
The house turned its back on the road

427
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:32,159
Well when you get inside her if we go around back you'll see that whole back of the house so I'll glass it's all open

428
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:37,023
Come to the back and he only did that intentionally the kind of close it off to the street and then

429
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
Open it up to the back

430
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:43,935
As right site the point of the house would love to have a big facade to show off your neighbors

431
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,263
With a useless and wasteful patch of lawn in the front

432
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
Cinegrand entryway

433
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
No

434
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
House

435
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
Should be built for residents

436
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
Not on lockers

437
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,735
Also from the street you can see that there's no garage

438
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,295
Car is parked under a wooden awning

439
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,855
Just a little flat roof with no sidewalk

440
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
This is the carport

441
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,463
The term that Frank Lloyd Wright coin

442
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
Well this is the

443
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,023
Carport of the houses

444
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
Considered the first

445
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,631
Named carport it was a turn that right came up with

446
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,215
This was one of the many tiny ways right cap cost down

447
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,287
And also the carport was an education in lifestyle

448
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,383
Without a garage that Jacobs wouldn't have space to store their junk

449
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,479
Adaptive simply minimize their possessions and toss what they didn't need

450
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,295
The carport isn't purely utilitarian

451
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
The woodwork on the carport roof

452
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,391
Has this lovely geometric pattern

453
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Who is like these boys

454
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
Kind of stripes in the

455
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,839
Funny when I've seen Matt heard about the carport and like seeing pictures of it I didn't expect it to be so

456
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
Beautiful in like

457
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,655
Really nice

458
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,215
Nothing in this house the more you look around more

459
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
Moore UCLA

460
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
But the ceiling here

461
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
Carport

462
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
Expect that

463
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
Get inside the sea the same thing

464
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,455
Usonia 1 is full of small elegant details

465
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
Sure

466
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Warm in here

467
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
Oh wow

468
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
Sun

469
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
Red

470
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
Every like the brick in the wall

471
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
Florida

472
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
Here I kind of gets drawn in

473
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,559
Usonia 1 is 1/4

474
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
And inside it's pretty much one room

475
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
And loud

476
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Cat

477
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,447
The space is all open no walls

478
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,495
Between the living room dining room kitchen

479
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,543
That was kind of innovative for the time

480
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,871
The kitchen is an Alcove adjacent the living / dining space

481
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Face with no door

482
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
It's a very

483
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Barry

484
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,247
Tiny area this is this is the kitchen

485
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,087
It's just a little bit wider than the length of my arms I think weight

486
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
But eat footbike

487
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
8 foot square rug

488
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
Is a small hallway width

489
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
Tiny bedrooms

490
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,559
But mostly the one main room is the focus

491
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,607
That's why you're supposed to eat relax

492
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Read

493
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
Live all together

494
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,703
Again Herbert Jacob

495
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,311
Advocate of the open-plan and housing

496
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,639
Bee removal of a boxes within boxes

497
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
You don't have

498
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
Many petitions

499
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
Temptation music

500
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
Be together much more

501
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
The open-plan was pretty novel

502
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,487
And it was cost-saving to not have many walls

503
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,559
Usonian house is full of these clever

504
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
Less expensive solution

505
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
Like the lights on the ceiling

506
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
So that's just

507
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,215
Steel Channel with the wires just

508
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,543
Land in there and then bare socket spare bulbs

509
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
Let's consider the first

510
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Track lighting

511
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Another first

512
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
To the house

513
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,943
And now you see track lighting everywhere

514
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
Where do you see lights

515
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Its or bulbs

516
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
Fix to a single beam

517
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,087
That's a usonian invention

518
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,927
Other Innovations usonia popularized include the use of flat roof

519
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
Built-in furniture

520
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
Heated floors

521
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
Herbert Jacobs

522
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,559
Love those heated floors

523
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
Poor Heating

524
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,119
No very general

525
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,471
But at that time there were no floor he did resident Susan this country

526
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,311
All of these Innovations Were Meant to help the family live well

527
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Frugally

528
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,127
They saved money while they lived in the house

529
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
And they also save costs

530
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
In the construction of the house

531
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,039
But right you some other cost-saving measures that were kind of

532
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Cheating

533
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,135
Like he stole some bricks from another building of his

534
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
But he was constructing nearby

535
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,720
Well right didn't steal the bricks himself

536
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
He sent a bunch of his apprentices over to Racine Wisconsin where his design for the Johnson wax building was under

537
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
Construction

538
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,216
He told the apprentices to grab as many bricks if they could

539
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
And bring them back to Madison

540
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
If you're familiar with the

541
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,080
Johnson wax building

542
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,128
The corners are curved

543
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
So you can see

544
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
Some of these bricks are

545
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,040
Convex or concave while those were

546
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
Like Corner brick

547
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,904
Another way right cap cost down was by taken

548
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,696
Huge pay cut himself

549
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:55,584
Bill I paid was for $5,500 which included Mr rights fee of $450

550
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
By hook or by crook

551
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
Brighten it

552
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,960
He met his challenge of building a beautiful house

553
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,008
At Herbert and Katherine could afford

554
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
I mean

555
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
It wasn't

556
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Perfect

557
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
The total adjustment for the family

558
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:13,504
In the house had problems with rain drainage and little things were missing like initially right forgot to put

559
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
Screens on the windows

560
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,344
Which one of the kinds of complaints right got a lot

561
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,416
He mostly focused on Aesthetics and principles of building

562
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
Rather than practicalities

563
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
And ultimately

564
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
The Jacob's house was

565
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Small

566
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
After Herbert and Katherine had two more children

567
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
They couldn't fit into the house anymore

568
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,728
I'm so after 6 years of living in usonia 1

569
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,544
The Jacobs family would move off to the countryside

570
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,128
We're Frank Lloyd Wright wood design them a second usonian house

571
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,480
But Herbert Jacobs thought of their first home very fondly

572
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,272
Living in that house was

573
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
Fantastic

574
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:56,000
Mister Wright thought so too. Everybody should live in a house

575
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
Design by humans

576
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352
Dishes and clothes

577
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
Designed by him and all the furniture

578
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
He did design a lot of his furniture

579
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,032
And at least one case he did design a dress for the wife of

580
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,848
This was all about changing culture

581
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,152
One home at a time

582
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,712
Frank Lloyd Wright wanted to redesign America

583
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,016
And by that token Americans

584
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,600
Good design he thought would make a Kinder more beautiful

585
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:26,464
More enlightened country

586
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
You don't need a guy

587
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:32,352
You'll know my 1939 right head Built usonian Homes all over the country

588
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,680
Including houses in Alabama California Illinois

589
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Michigan

590
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
In Virginia

591
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
But he wanted to build more

592
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,896
He wanted have a central Factory that made prefabricated usonian parts

593
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,992
Modifiable for each client depending on their needs for space insight

594
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,552
And originally the whole idea was

595
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,600
All these walls would be

596
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
Manufactured in

597
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Factory

598
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,744
That never really happened this was all site-built

599
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,584
Frank Lloyd Wright's Factory for usonian homes never came to power

600
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:09,984
And it became increasingly clear to write that the $5,000 price tag for usonian homes

601
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,288
Wasn't feasible after the Depression

602
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,872
Also right career picked up shortly after usonia 1

603
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,920
He started building bigger Commission

604
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,200
The ones we all know him

605
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480

606
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:25,856
I'm on the right house is none has been more widely publicized and the Pennsylvania home of Edgar Kaufmann

607

Which battles of waterfalls

608
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:31,744
Right worked on usonian homes up until near the very end of his life

609
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,048
But it was a group of his Apprentice

610
