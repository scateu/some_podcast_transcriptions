Chicago's history

73
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:58,688
The design of the Chicago flag has complete buying with an entire cross-section of the city it's

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Everywhere

75
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504

00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
It's a distinct

81
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,488
Symbol of Chicago's Pride when a police officer or firefighter

82
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Chicago

83
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,560
State flag on a casket

84
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
It's the city of Chicago flag

85
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
That's How Deeply it's got into the city

86
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
Civic imagery

87
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
And it isn't just that

88
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,776
People love Chicago and they're full of the flag

89
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
I also think

90
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,616
People love Chicago more

91
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,664
Because the flag is so cool

92
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,224
Positive feedback loops are between

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Great symbolism

94
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
And civic pride

95
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,368
So when I move back to San Francisco in 2008 I researched its flag

96
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
Because I've never

97
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
Seen it

98
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,464
Before in the previous eight years I live here

99
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
And I found it

100
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,536
I'm sorry to say

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
Sadly

102
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
Let me start at the top

103
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
Number one

104
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Simple that a child can

105
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:57,568
Can draw it from memory the relatively complex flag main component of the San Francisco flag is a Fina

106
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:02,176
Representing our rising from the ashes after the great fires of the 1850s

107
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
Powerful symbols

108
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
San Francisco

109
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
I still don't really dig the Phoenix

110
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,880
Design-wise it had too many details into many colors and it doesn't leave work at a distance

111
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
But having deep meaning

112
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
What's that element

113
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Plus

114
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
Man large penis

115
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,303
The background is mainly why

116
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
The flag also has a

117
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
Central gold border around

118
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
Which is a very attractive

119
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
Define Elam

120
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
But Here Come the big no-nos

121
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
Custom flag design

122
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,335
No lettering or

123
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,871
Are seals never use writing

124
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Think of any kind

125
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Underneath the Phoenix

126
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
There's a motto on a ribbon that Translate

127
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
Next to gold and peace

128
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
Iron in war

129
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Plus

130
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
And this is the

131
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
Big problem

132
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,415
It's a San Francisco across the bay

133
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,743
Bottom if you need to write the name of what you representing on

134
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Your flag

135
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
Your symbolism

136
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Failed

137
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
United States flag doesn't say USA across

138
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
The good news is

139
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Best names

140
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
Might not be completely our fault

141
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,263
A city flag

142
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,567
Interstate that has its own

143
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Name

144
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
On the state flag

145
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
What end to Echo Dot

146
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,759
Yep the California Bear Flag says California Republic

147
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,343
So maybe we can blame this all on our capital city Sacramento

148
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Is awesome

149
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,439
I love blaming Sacramento for things

150
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,255
I like to say that in every bad flag there's

151
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
It's a good flag trying to get out

152
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:27,935
Well the way to make San Francisco's flag a good flag would be to take tomorrow off because you can't read that a disc

153
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
How to take the name off and the Border might even be made thicker so it's it's more of a part of the

154
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,919
Can I would just simply take the Phoenix and make it a grape

155
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
Big element

156
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
In the middle of the flag

157
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
The current

158
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
Got to go I would

159
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
Simplifier stylized

162
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,279
Emphasize the Flames the next time you find yourself with a vexillologist

163
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,327
I'm never going to say that word by

176

Five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

177
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,191
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

Might cost you your life

182
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,967
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

183
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,319
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

184
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,903
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

186
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,023
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

187
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,327
Actually if I'm being honest

188
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,375
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

189

A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

190
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,383
Was found dead in my private gym

191
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,711
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

192
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,063
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

193
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
Now

194
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
I need to clear my name

195
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,487
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do

196
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
Whatever it takes to find them

00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:37,727
