I'm Roman Mars

The part of town north of the Panhandle is known as nopa

33
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:26,784
Just north of our office is a part of town that Oakland is trying to Brand as Kono

34
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
Short for

00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,344
Koreatown Northgate

36
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
But no one actually calls it that

37
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,744
I live in a part of town at the intersection of North Oakland Berkeley and Emeryville

38
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,816
A neighborhood real estate brokers are calling

39

43
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,544
Such cliches

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,896
Like there's an episode of Southpark where part of town gets rebranded as

45
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
South of downtown South Park

46
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Or

47
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
Sodosopa

48
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,064
Vibe and energy

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088

56
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Here in New York

57
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,480
We just shorten the names of all today Soho Tribeca nolita

58
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,856
I'm from New York I know this neighborhood

59
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,720
Joey's a tree pot turns out to be short for downwind of the sewage treatment plant

60
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,072
Are brokers who are we naming parts of harlem as soha

61
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
Parts of Little Italy

Marketing the Bronx as SoBro

64
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,544
He represents New York's 8th congressional

65
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
Which is Brooklyn and parts

66
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
Queens these are names that

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
I created out of thin air

68
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
If fantasy their fiction

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
It made up solely in my view

70
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,368
To artificially inflate prices

71
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,696
Before Congressman Jeffries was elected to the House of Representatives

72
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,000
He was a member of the New York State

73
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,096
And he saw these neighborhood abbreviations creep into his jurisdiction

74
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
Real estate brokers

75
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
Or we naming parts of

76
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
Crown Heights

77
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,520
As Pro Crow Crow Crow

78
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,408
Cro cro which is a combination apparently of the Prospect Heights neighborhood

79
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
And Crown Heights

80
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:36,064
Properties in Prospect Heights have generally sold for more than those in Crown Heights

81
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
I'm making this new neighborhood

82
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Pro Crow

83
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
Brokers could sell Crown Heights properties

84
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
Prospect Heights prices

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,144
Congressman Jeffries did not like anything about this he didn't like the sound of pro Crow and he didn't like with an a

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
I was trying to do

87
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
So we tried to stop it

88
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
Show me research the issue

89
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,824
It turned out that it was no

90
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
So the governmental entity

91
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,944
Involved in the designation of

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Neighborhood

93
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,296
In 2011 Jeffries proposed the neighborhood integrity

94
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,904
Which set out to create guidelines and regulations for new neighborhood names and boundaries

95
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,232
But it turned out that it's hard to pass a law against names

96
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,303
The neighborhood Integrity act didn't gain traction

97
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
But neither did the name Pro Crow

98
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,447
Some names don't stick Pro Crow was just silly

99
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
And thankfully

100
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
It was abandoned

101
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,359
You never really know which of these names will stick around

102
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,455
Like there's a part of Midtown Manhattan that was recently renamed nomad

103
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
Are north of Madison Avenue

104
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
People are starting to use it

105
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
You can see it on Google Maps

106
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,647
And it's weird there's not really a name for the naming convention

107
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
Like NoHo SoBro Noma

108
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,023
You're not quite acronym sonar Quake portmanteau

109
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
They're not just abbreviation

110
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,119
The office we've been calling them

111
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,143
Acronyms

112
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,263
Agnes Agnes it's too much as I can be a thing

113
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
Find their acronyms

114
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,615
And they trace their lineage back to Soho

115
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
Short for south of Houston Street

116
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
In New York

117
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,247
It's really interesting house Soho

118
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,087
Developed first as a local neighborhood brand

119
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,391
And then became globalized

120
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:21,535
Sharon zukin is a professor of Sociology at Brooklyn College and The Graduate Center of the City University of New York

121
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
You have neighborhoods

122
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
Of

123
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
Boston and Washington

124
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
DC

125
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
And Seattle and

126
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,519
Denver abbreviated

127
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:37,919
As low-dose o dos o Mas Alla trading on the brand name of

128
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:44,319
So now they're already was a Soho District in London but as the allusionist Helen zaltzman will tell you that

129
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
That is not

130
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
Most of the evidence

131
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
Point Street having being a hunting cry

132
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
Soho

133
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
Liked

134
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,303
Because Soho stands on what used to be hunting them

135
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,655
Other people will tell you that solo is a shortening of south of Hoboken

136
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
Butt face people ignoring the fact

137
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
So he's actually

138
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,055
West of the area of harbin

139
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Which would make

140
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Soho

141
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Weho

142
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
Which it is

143
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
London Soho may have been first

144
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,807
But the American abbreviation of Soho and the birth of the acronym

145
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,111
Can be traced back to 1962

146
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,439
And a fellow by the name of Chester rapkin

147
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,767
He was an urban planner and

148
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,351
Eventually a member of the New York City Planning Commission

149
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
From the lake

150
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Extjs

151
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
To the late night

152
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
70

153
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
And he was asked

154
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,031
To investigate the conditions

155
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
In what

156
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,407
He called or what the City Planning Commission called

157
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
The South

158
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
Houston industrial area

159
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,575
A lot of people think that the resulting paper known as the rapkin report

160
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,135
Invented the term Soho

161
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
I have

162
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
Recently read that report

163
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,791
And I do not believe that rapkin used

164
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
The term Soho

165
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
In that report

166
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,215
It's also been said that rapkin coined the term Soho in conversation

167
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,263
However it happened around this time

168
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
People

169
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Seized upon

170
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,199
The term Soho has an abbreviation which is certainly better than the South Houston industrial area

171
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
But

172
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
Not nearly as badass as its previous name

173
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
Held Hundred Acre

174
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:26,463
In the 1950s and early 60s for industrial Manufacturing

175
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,559
At the time rabkin was writing the report

176
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,375
It was not the most Pleasant part of town

177
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:40,287
He mentioned in passing the Grim caverns of factory buildings in SoHo

178
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
That's absolutely true

179
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,407
The South Houston Industrial Area was threatened with demolition

180
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,527
Brick buildings with cast iron facades were seen as ugly outdated

181
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
Eyesores

182
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
I mean they were factories

183
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,463
Smack in the middle of downtown Manhattan there had been a major pressure

184
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,047
The part of city government as well as

185
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
Probably the real estate industry

186
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
To demolish these

187
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Worthless building

188
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
And replace them

189
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,055
With one of the new residential projects

190
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
This was in the early sixties when New York City under the influence of Robert Moses was trying to tear down and rebuild

191
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
They were wrecking ball happy

192
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
But the rap game report made

193
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
A plea to preserve

194
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
The factory

195
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
And the city held off on their plan

196
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
Rapkin

197
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Said

198
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,303
The manufacturers in those buildings were viable

199
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
And it would be

200
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
Interesting

201
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
Maybe even great

202
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,471
If the manufacturing buildings

203
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Wer

204
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
Renovated

205
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,639
For manufacturing use nobody foresaw that the area

206
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,943
Would become colonized by artist

207
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,831
Artist rented the manufacturing spaces for Studios

208
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Soho

209
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,415
In the 1970s

210
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
Quickly gain

211
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,767
The identity of an artist District

212
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
The Loft

213
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,095
Weren't supposed to be residential

214
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
They weren't up to City housing standards

215
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,191
State Standards fire codes

216
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Anyting

217
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,311
For while the city skirted around this problem by classifying artists as

218
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
Machine

219
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Who manufactured art

220
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
And conduct stay in the fact

221
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Overnight

222
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:28,831
Performers and Painters and musicians out of their lives

223
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,671
And these attracted attention from Arts Publications and newspapers

224
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,975
So how was if not the very

225
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
First Industrial District

226
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
To be trance

227
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Formed

228
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Into

229
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
Live work

230
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
And living

231
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Space

232
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,983
It was certainly the most

233
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Prominent

234
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
In the media

235
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,175
To the success of Soho the urban planning department wanted to do on purpose would it happen by accident in SoHo

236
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
They set their sights on a nearby area

237
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,039
The triangle below Canal Street

238
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
Or as they called

239
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Tribeca

240
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,159
Tribeca was also a former manufacturer

241
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
Chaoyang district

242
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,255
But it was intentionally rezoned for mixed-use

243
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,815
Chanel factories and Residences in gallery

244
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
This could exist

245
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
Side by side

246
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Legal aid

247
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
You know the story from here

248
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
Artist moved into the old boss

249
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
Made them seem to have been desirable

250
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,591
In higher-income residences and businesses slowly took over

251
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
And now of course

252
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,431
Soho and Tribeca are fancy fancy places

253
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
Full Boutique

254
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
Send high-end residences

255
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,319
All housed in the architectural

256
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
Skeletons

257
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
Old industry

258
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
So how was

259
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
Able

260
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
2

261
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Intubate

262
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
And disseminate

263
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,839
All of these trends that became so important

264
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
In interior design

265
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
In the 80s

266
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
+ 90

267
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,263
It'll probably on in to mm

268
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,591
Soho and Tribeca warrant just the rise of acronyms

269
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
They were the birth of industrial chic

270
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
They created the whole

271
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
Static that comes to mind with these neighborhood

272
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,879
In SoHo artist embrace the best judges of the batteries they were living and working

273
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,463
They found the big metal fixtures and beams loading dock

274
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Charming

275
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,303
And this became a kind of

276
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
Expensive minimalism

277
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
That marked

278
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
High-status

279
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
Taste in interior

280
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
Design exposed brick walls distressed floors big Windows large Open Spaces big beams

281
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
Bronze fixtures

282
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
The old factories became trendy

283
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
And new wealthier residents

284
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,039
Added layers of conventional luxury

285
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
Now people install

286
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Very

287
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Expensive

288
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
Marble bath

289
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
Send floors

290
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
Wine Vault

291
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,791
Into former Industrial

292
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Loft

293
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
So that the simplicity

294
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
Of the first generation

295
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,447
Of industrial chic

296
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,519
Has turned into the excess

297
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Of

298
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Current

299
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
Multimillion-dollar

300
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Loft

301
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,479
Lawson is genuine old buildings now go for millions of dollars

302
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,527
And new condos and development

303
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,343
Are actively trying to look like old warehouses

304
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:14,975
And in other parts of New York and other cities around the world developers started to copy Soho

305
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
Not just an industrial area

306
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,143
But in all kinds of neighborhoods independent of whoever was already living or working there

307
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,239
Real estate developers around the world copy this and they say let's

308
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,775
Bring some stores let

309
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
Let's encourage some performance

310
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
Space is some art galleries

311
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Let's

312
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,991
Make this area interesting let's give it a name

313
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
And as time went on

314
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
A new name

315
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
Especially an acronym

316
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
He came he big indicator

317
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
At your neighborhood

318
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
What about

319
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,559
What we're seeing is it something as an air of gentrification

320
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
This is Jacqueline Wong

321
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
Postdoctoral research fellow at Princeton University

322
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,751
2006 she did a comprehensive study of residence in a section

323
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
Have South Philadelphia

324
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
Where he basically went up to them and asked

325
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
What do you call your neighborhood

326
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:10,015
So in the section of Philly most of the minority residents referred to as South Philly

327
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
White residence

328
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
Spann real estate agents in Craigslist post

329
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
That list of the properties

330
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:21,023
Most commonly they use the name graduate hospital so named because of Hospital used to be in that neighborhood

331
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,119
Other people have referred to it as G so-so

332
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,727
Which is supposed to represent south of South Street

333
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Ghoe or so-so

334
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
These newcomers really identified more

335
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
With graduated

336
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
Hilton South Philly

337
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,479
Now just to be clear neighborhoods do shift and change names periodically

338
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
But Jacqueline says the recent name in Russia

339
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
He's different

340
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
I would say that

341
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,927
There's an intention behind this and sort of a power

342
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
Play happening

343
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
Yeah there's a group that's

344
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,607
Redefining it while another group is trying to

345
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
Hold on to this older name

346
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,727
As Cities boom and gentrification Rises

347
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,519
New neighborhoods get made

348
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
A new names

349
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Proliferate

350
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
I'm not saying neighborhood changes not

351
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:12,735
Good for these neighborhoods they certainly needs investment but I think that idea that there is

352
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
This

353
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Displacing

354
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,743
And evaluate the previous name in order to make the neighborhood

355
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
Change doctor

356
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
This gets at the

357
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Achiness

358
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,911
I feel about using the term Nobby to describe where I live

359
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,495
I don't want to be the newcomer who alienates the old residence

360
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
By using some term

361
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
Bed to me by real estate

362
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,895
But nobody is also useful

363
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Because it's specific

364
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
And it's efficient

365
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
I mean saying I live in Novi is obviously faster than saying I live at the border of North Oakland Berkeley and Emeryville

366
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Well I live in Adobe

367
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,279
Which is downtown Berkeley I just made up the damn Dobby

368
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,863
That is comedian and longtime Bay Area resident W kamau Bell

369
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
I was thinking about my neighborhood and gentry

370
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Application

371
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
When I happened to run into him

372
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
Appropriately

373
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799
At the South Berkeley Farmers Market

374
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:14,431
I know they called the South Berkeley Farmers Market but I've lived in the very long enough to remember when this was called Oakland right here

375
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,735
This feels like South South South

376
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
South

377
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
South Berkeley

378
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,111
Camille feels uncomfortable with these acronyms to

379
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Oh no

380
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
It's a kind of magic

381
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
Downtown

382
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,975
Koreatown Northgate photo

383
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
Oh no

384
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
But he says if your focus too much on neighborhood name

385
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
You might be missing the point

386
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Let's just symptomatic of like

387
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,471
This is like the neighbors name is like

388
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:42,847
The old log in the woods and he looked up in a room and you see all the bugs underneath and that's the best interpretation

389
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,199
Navigate to focused on the name you're probably not focus on what's going on Into the Woods

390
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,807
Acronyms are easy to Lampoon

391
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,135
They're ubiquitous to the point of parody and often

392
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,719
So we may see a shift away from these names

393
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:04,863
Real estate developers will start using less silly sounding names to Market neighborhoods to higher-paying customers

394
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:10,495
These names might sound more authentic like graduate Hospital in Philly or temascal in Oakland

395
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
But they're different names for the same thing

396
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,127
The same log over the ants of Education

397
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,223
And as far as what you should call your neighborhood if you're a newcomer

398
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,807
I mean I feel like the bigger issues to respect the neighbors are moving into

399
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,879
If you respect the Neighbors movie until you aren't trying to

400
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:32,511
Be the change you trying to be the blind then you should have been whatever people they would call it then call it back

401
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
So I took him out

402
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
I walked in on my block

403
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
Can I ask people

404
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
What do you call this neighborhood

405
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
I met a few newcomers like me

406
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,031

00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335

But the neighbors have lived here for a while

411
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
All said the same thing

412
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551

Bongs and chatter of our devices

434
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
We're immersed in a cluttered world

435
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
A man-made sound

436
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:14,655

502
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,247
