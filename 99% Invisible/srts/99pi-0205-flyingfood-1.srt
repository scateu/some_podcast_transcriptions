These Foods don't look like they do in the ass

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,264
I'm here with a question from Isabelle Ave from Toronto Ontario she asked why does your food look different in the advertising

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
In what in the store

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
The great question Isabel we get off that a lot

61
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,456
And if you want to come with me I'm going to take you across the street we're going to find out a bit more

62
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
In 2012 McDonald's Canada put out this video about the process they go through to photograph one of

63
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Their burgers

64
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,952
Let me introduce you now to Noah's Ark

65
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
Food stylist

66
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,048
I think it's important to note that all the ingredients

67
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,608
No uses are the exact same ingredients

68
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
The video follows food stylist Noah as he painstakingly selects the perfect slices of us

69
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,640
Onion and pickle pee places them on the burger with tweezers

70
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
And then precisely melt

71
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
The cheese just so

72
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,272
So if I'm jacked melting down

73
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,952
Then he picks up a plastic syringe filled with ketchup and applies it with surgical precision

74
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
Maybe I'll put

75
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
Mustard ketchup

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
Actually catch up must

77
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,936
Then they photograph this fancy burger and Photoshop it to perfection

78
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,848
They place a picture of a real burger just ordered at McDonald's

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
Next to the image of this stylized Burger

80
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
And the difference

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
Is striking

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,272
That's reporter Danny Lewis

83
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,344
I would like to eat the burger that Noah styled into symbol

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,136
The other one not so much

85
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:44,256
The last hundred years or so of food advertising have been shaped by this one simple

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
Real food looks

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Bad on camera

88
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,704
Shooting food and even photographing food is always been fiendishly difficult in that

89
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
This is Terry O'Reilly

90
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Predict it

91
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
He was an ad man

92
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,616
And he now hosts a radio show about advertising

93
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
Called under the influence

94
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,736
Terry says the challenges of shooting food are obvious

95
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,832
First of all food is boring to look at when it's just sitting on a plane

96
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,880
Because food is he generally static

97
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
Then when you subjected to the Hot Lights of a

98
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
Studio the food starts to wilt

99
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
It's just simple science

100
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:23,167
And so advertisers have had to constantly walk this fine line between enhancement and faker

101
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,215
Find all kinds of tricks

102
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,263
To get food to look good

103
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,383
For the first half of the 20th century well after photography it was widely adopted

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,735
Advertisers in magazines and newspapers relied heavily on illustration

105
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
The reason illustration

106
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,367
What's the preferred method was because you can completely control an illustration

107
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,719
Another word just know lighting issues there's no wilting food issues

108
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,535
A marketer could really completely dick

109
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,887
Tate what that food would look like right down to the to the strand of pasta

110
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
With an illustrate

111
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,983
Then TV came along in the 1950s and 60s

112
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
And advertisers face a whole new set of challenges

113
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,895
I'm going to show you how McDonald's build a Big Mac sandwich

114
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,503
A lot of them didn't really understand how to shoot food in a compelling way

115
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,087
In this add the hamburger just sits there on the counter

116
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
All the ingredients get piled on

117
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,463
It starts here with a lightly Toasted Bun

118
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,303
And then a pure beef hamburger

119
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Sizzling hot

120
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
Without compelling visuals

121
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
Optavia voiceover

122
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
Just describing the hell out of the

123
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
The food

124
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Listing ingredients

125
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,823
Telling you how good it tasted

126
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,383
A little more sauce just for good flavor

127
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
Crisp dill pickles

128
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
And the sesame seed crown

129
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,599
These early tv ads relied on relatively static shots

130
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,439
Advertisers would use a wide-angle lens mounted on a camera

131
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,511
Animated Superman and pain a little but that's about it

132
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,559
There were lots of shots of boxes

133
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
And labels

134
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
The food did

135
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,679
Just normal food stuff you might see

136
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,287
Something being ladled out of a pot you might see you know a spoon

137
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,895
Serving peas at a dinner table or serving cream corn at a dinner table

138
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,943
So that would be the extent of the motion

139
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,247
On top of the new challenges of television

140
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:19,647
Food advertisers in the late 60s found themselves facing new scrutiny the Federal Trade Commission with keeping a close eye

141
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Ion TV

142
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
Following now infamous

143
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
Campbell Soup incident

144
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
1968

145
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:31,679
They were introducing a new brand of suit that has a lot of vegetables in it but the problem is the vegetable sink to the bottom

146
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
So what they did was

147
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,543
Put a bunch of marbles in the bottom of the bowl

148
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
Just too high.

149
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
The

150
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,199
When the FTC found out they threaten Campbell's with legal Act

151
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,527
Event led to a new push for truth in advertising

152
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,647
A lot of the old tricks advertisers had relied on it for now off the table

153
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
No more using glue

154
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
Milk and cereal ads

155
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,303
No more substituting mashed potatoes for ice cream

156
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
But in the 1970s

157
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
Food advertising took a radical

158
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
Started

159
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,639
Shrimp executing acrobatic flips

160
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,199
Lobster claws cracking open in slow motion

161
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,503
French fries bouncing across a table

162
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
Wasn't static anymore

163
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
Food was flying

164
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,671
And we've got one man to thank for this new aesthetic

165
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
Albert Beauty

166
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
You didn't want anything

167
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
Everything was always smooth

168
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
He wanted to

169
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
Romance

170
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
The food

171
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
Or whatever was in front of

172
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
This is Harry Drennan

173
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,823
Who spent years working for Elbert beaudin

174
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
That's how he met his wife

175
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
Set director Jackie Chan

176
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,711
I've been in the film business for

177
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,039
35 years 40 I don't want to say hello

178
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,903
The ads that can tow in Trenton made with you until his death in 1996

179
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
We're on precedent

180
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:03,839
Working with clients like McDonald's Burger King and Coca-Cola invented a whole new visual language

181
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Food commercial

182
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,191
Sandra Lee Pioneer the genre of advertising known

183
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,471
As table top

184
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,847
Many of the terms and techniques that table top directors still use date back to Beauty

185
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
The prep shot

186
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
Which tells the backstory of the Prada

187
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,759
Showing all that goes into making the food

188
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
You know the ones

189
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
Chopping a crisp out of lettuce

190
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
Dicing some juicy red tomatoes

191
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
He would make these

192
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,719
Elaborate banquet things

193
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
Raw ingredients

194
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
That was his look

195
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
And creepshots

196
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,239
That's when the camera zooms way in and lingers on some tantalizing bite of food on the end of a fork

197
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,079
Sexy and you know it's almost foodporn you know it's

198
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
Made it all real tactel to you

199
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
And the hero shot

200
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,991
The last magnificent look at the food

201
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
On the plate ready to eat

202
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,111
Usually in the final seconds of the advertising

203
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,743
Mutants big breakthrough was that he didn't just describe the food and promised viewers it takes

204
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,303
He made them feel actual

205
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
Hunger with his image

206
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,703
His real thing is just food in itself its Essence is really sensual

207
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
You know what I mean

208
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,079
Juicy Hamburger commercial

209
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Point of it

210
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
And I think that's what he introduced

211
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
And you'll never see it any other way now

212
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,623
Kendall and Drennan remember working long days and

213
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
Sometimes tomorrow

214
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
To meet budenz hi-standard

215
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
And to achieve his vision of flying food

216
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,279
Mouth watering clothes

217
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
They had to use a whole bunch

218
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
Crazy tool

219
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:46,239
Like giant high speed camera that was burned through 1000 feet of film in seconds

220
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,823
They start shooting

221
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:59,551
All day long it was something originally designed for the military

222
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
Go ballistic but we were the first ones to do it with food

223
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Super slow motion effect

224
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
You take a split second of time

225
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
And luxuriate in it

226
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
He'd have oranges Splash through a sheet of water

227
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,727
Condensation would drip down the side of a bottle

228
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,775
In order to get the perfect egg

229
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
Butan started designing strange

230
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,895
Rube Goldberg soda machines album get the job done

231
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
These Contraptions were called rigs

232
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:33,343
They range from simple spouts for liquid to machines that would drop pancakes into a perfect stack to catapults that would

233
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
Languages across the studio

234
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,487
And sure the production team could have just thrown The Oranges by hand

235
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
But with a rig

236
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
They could get the exact

237
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Same result

238
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
Over and over

239
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
Which meant fewer takes

240
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
Which meant less time and less money spell

241
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,031
Also meant that they could achieve a certain level of

242
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Precision and artist

243
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
It was so much prettier than other people

244
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
It's working

245
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Far as I could see

246
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Is beautiful and Lighting

247
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,063
And then with Iowa once he got into all the movement that me he was it

248
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
He was ahead of the curb

249
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
Lights roll Steve

250
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,959
To see how beautance techniques are still being used today

251
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,311
Danny went to MacGuffin films in New York okay so just quit

252
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,687
MacGuffin does commercials for Red Lobster Olive Garden Starbucks in a bunch by the restaurant

253
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:37,343
Today Danny was there they were shooting a chicken sandwich so they are shooting a chicken sandwich

254
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,927
Sure Shot it looks like on a black

255
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Sleep

256
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
A little Trail

257
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
Chili Peppers and garlic and stuff

258
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:52,703
A hand model stands near the edge of the table for the sandwiches play so now they're doing the crowning

259
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
Crowning means the hand model takes the bun

260
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
And put it on top of the sandwich

261
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,639
Does President there alluringly

262
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
Ben takes the crown off

263
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:08,575
Fan brush tattoo

264
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,647
Top of the chicken

265
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
Then the ground goes back on again

266
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
It took them all day to film this sandwich

267
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
The whole shoot precisely orchestrated

268
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,263
Relying on highly technical tool

269
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,383
Downstairs in macguffins proper I'm there all sorts of rig sitting in storage

270
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,431
A lot like the ones that butan develop

271
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
But these are way more high-tech

272
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,599
Riggers today use lasers and sensors and pre-programmed Motors

273
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
And depending on the shot or the rig

274
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,975
There can be some intense physic to take into account

275
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:53,375
Like if you're trying to slice an onion into while it's flying through the air break down the elements

276
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
Got to get it done yin to a certain height

277
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
This is Anthony the robber

278
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,031
He's a special effects technician at MacGuffin films

279
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:06,431
And he designed a special rake just to get this shot

280
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,295
These two sharp knives come through split the onion and leave you with the sliced in the middle

281
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,879
And slices of onion artfully tumbling across a table

282
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Classic truck shop

283
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,743
But Wellbutrin may have introduced rigs in action to tabletop

284
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,559
Some directors like macguffins Nick fugles.

285
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,655
We're trying to get away from humans Fantastical Dreamscapes of flying shrimp

286
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,823
I think that's a little bit of an older point of view for next few ghosts at images of food that be

287
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
Tried to bring to his ads

288
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,199
Just don't cut it in a world that's now totally saturated with food poi

289
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,831
Well Butrans commercials often zoomed-in so close to food that you couldn't see the space around it

290
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:50,463
Tabletop directors like Google start now frame there food in the space that you might see out in the world

291
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,255
Like at a restaurant or barbecue

292
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,351
And when you dig into a lasagna do you want the sauce to go all over the place

293
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,167
We need to taco stuff going to fall out yet so let's shoot

294
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,983
Let it the flavors mix

295
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
It's alright sweet taste good

296
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
But the thing to remember is this

297
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
On the set of a food commercial

298
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Everything

299
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Everything

300
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,479
Is highly orchestrated and contrived

301
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,295
Even if the ultimate effect feel somewhat natural

302
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,183
Because a 30-second TV spot by a firm like Magoffin can cost literally hundreds of thousands of dollars

303
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,255
Who's got to do one thing to make it all worthwhile

304
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
Sell a lot of food

305
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,119
I would say the number one rule

306
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:34,751
In food advertising is that the first taste is always with the eyes

307
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
So you trying to create a shot

308
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
That makes somebody's

309
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
This is Terry O'Reilly again

310
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,015
And he's fascinated by the links people go to sell some

311
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,599
He tells a story about working on commercial for a hamburger company

312
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
And watching an actor do take after take

313
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Bite into a hamburger

314
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,559
And I'm gazing into the camera with a log of total satisfaction on his face

315
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
Then you cut and then there's this

316
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,263
Right beside the actor then they just spit it right into the pale

317
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,639
And you have any watch that happen 40 times or 30 times or 20 minutes so hilarious to me

318
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
Just the mechanics

319
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Hematocrit

320
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,551
The illusion and the reality of creating if that's exactly it in a nutshell

321
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,815
Play 99% invisible wolf producer Suite by Danny Lewis Delaney Hall in Avery truffle

Between the beats

330
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,719
Bongs and chatter of our devices

331
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
We're immersed

332
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,047
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

333
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
If

334
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,679
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

335
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Talking to

You talk to us

339
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
It is a creation of sun

340
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
Trash

341
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,735
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

342
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,063
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

343
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,111
To make them more human

344
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
Turn the living room lights on

345
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Okay

346
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
Dim the living room lights

347

50%

348
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
Okay

349
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:42,751
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

350
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,055
Makes for a much more natural

351
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Experience

352
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
Turn the living room lights on

353
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
Dim the living room lights

355
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:59,135
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

356
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,207
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

357
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,511
And how we can humanize the sounds around

358
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,583
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

359
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Right here

00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,887
E9pay

361
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,727
We need to talk about

362
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,543
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

363
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,407
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine

364
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
But thinking about it all the time is Frost
