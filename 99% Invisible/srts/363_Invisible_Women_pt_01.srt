1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
This is 99% invisible

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,072
I'm Roman Mars

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:09,216
Today Show is about a design flaw that might be and I'm not exaggerating here

4
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,544
The single most common design flaw in human history

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,336
If potentially effects

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,128
Everything we have ever built

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,480
Its consequences are felt by more than half of people worldwide

8
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,528
Most people

9
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,552
Don't even notice it

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,088
But that's changing

11
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,624
Thanks in no small part

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
The work

13
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,416
Of one woman

14
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,464
My name is Caroline criado-perez

15
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,024
I am a writer and activist

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,816
Who is written an Incredible Book

17
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,912
Invisible women exposing de Tobias

18
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,448
No wait sorry that's the question

19
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,240
What is the Americans

20
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,800
The copy I have is called invisible women

21
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,104
Data bias in the world design for men

22
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,152
British people sweat

23
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
American people

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,504
Is this a non swery podcast

25
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,856
Well you can swear all you like we will probably bleep it

26
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,416
I'll try to I'll try to keep it to a minimum

27
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:04,512
And honestly Caroline criado-perez has a good reason to swear

28
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,840
Because this design flaw in addition to being everywhere

29
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
Is really

30
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,704
But like so many of the worst design flaws

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,984
It can be hard to notice

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,544
The first to demonstrate just how hard

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,592
Caroline start off by telling me a story

34
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
That begins

35
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,128
With a joke

36
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
About gender

37
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,712
Basically

38
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,992
In this

39
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,296
Town kukulska. In Sweden

40
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,344
They were doing a gender analysis

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
List of all the policies

42
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
No tearing when having a feast

43
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
Agenda

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,632
And it does sound on the face of it ridiculous how can snakes have anything to do with gender

45
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,240
After all the city of karlskoga plaudit streets the way you think all cities with Father's tree

46
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
Starting with the major arteries

47
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
Followed by local roads in Cypress

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,920
It seemed about as genderless as you could get

49
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,248
But actually it turned out

50
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
It's gender

51
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Because

52
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,600
Male and female travel passes

53
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,768
Men are far more likely to travel in a fairly simple way using a car

54
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,096
For a twice daily commute in and out of the city center

55
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,728
You can see this in the way that most cities are laid out with major arteries going in and out of downtown and what's

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
An arterial cyst

57
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,824
Which makes a lot of sense if you are a man

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
It turns out

59
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
The weight many women

60
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,664
Is very

61
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
Women puppies more complicated travel packs

62
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
Say for example

63
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
Typical travel

64
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,840
Some groceries on the way home on an elderly relative

65
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,192
Public transport

66
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
DirecTV

67
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
Commercial air

68
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,872
When karlskoga snow plowing schedule was first designed all this trip chaining done by women

69
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
Simply wasn't factored in

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
Because it wasn't considered work

71
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
But actually this would contribute

72
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
Hugely

73
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,600
GDP

74
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
They discovered

75
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:11,488
That if you put all the unpaid carrot travel together at 10

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
Travel for those purposes

77
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,608
With almost as much as travel for paid work

78
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,472
Becomes a totally different proposition

79
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,312
What's the city planners started looking at the data through the lens of gender

80
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
Suddenly the idea

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
The city of karlskoga Sweden

82
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
Should plow its major arteries first

83
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
Didn't make intuitive sense

84
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,320
Because really really great for getting in and out of downtown

85
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,904
But it's not very good for traveling Between Difference

86
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
Some pups

87
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,000
Which is the kind of travel of the women are much more like to eat

88
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
To do

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,424
So the city council of karlskoga realizing that it's harder to push a buggy through 3 inches of snow than it is to drive a car

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,496
Decided to flip their snow clearing policy on its head

91
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,056
From now on it would be the miners

92
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Streets and sidewalks

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
Rocks that were plowed first

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Followed by the major artery

95
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,712
Expected it would actually save the money

96
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
Because it turned out that

97
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
Dramatic Kira Gees

98
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,904
The admissions into accident animations

99
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,696
Because they were right

100
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
Is much easier to drive a car

101
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,047
Events push a buggy

102
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,631
And pedestrians with massively dominating admission syntax

103
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Accident and emergency

104
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
And women

105
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,727
With dominating

106
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
I'm sorry bites

107
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
The simple thing is

108
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
Changing the order in which they play at the

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
They had this traumatic

110
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Effects

111
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
Healthcare bill

112
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
That was not an insignificant cost

113
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
Analysis

114
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
It was

115
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
3 *

116
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,463
The cost of the winter

117
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,559
What the point of the story isn't that karlskoga saved money

118
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,375
Or even that women suffer fewer injuries

119
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
It's that the snow cleaning policy

120
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,983
I've been poorly designed even though

121
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
City planners at started out

122
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
With the best of intentions

123
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,943
You know it's not like to travel, so I know you're let's make women full over in fracture that pelvis

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
That'll be really funny

125
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Faith just

126
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
Proceed

127
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,367
Along the presumption that what would work for them

128
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
Would just wax it Society

129
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:22,815
And when the schedule with device

130
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
But they forgot

131
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
As happens so often in

132
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,495
I'm to remember that women exist

133
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
And this goes all the way back to

134
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,359
The fact that you know this isn't just

135
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
Transport

136
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,919
Infrastructure

137
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
This is pretty much everything

138
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:46,367
Today I'm talking with Caroline criado-perez about the largest and most persistent data Gap in history

139
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,231
The failure to collect data on in from women when designing

140
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Almost

141
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
And the consequences of

142
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
Not just for women

143
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
But for everyone

144
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,703
So you talked about this a lot in your book

145
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
Which is that

146
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
At the root

147
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
I've almost

148
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
Aldi's design problems

149
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,847
Which don't seem to take women to

150
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:11,455
Is the fallacy of the default mail Daddy and that when we picture a kind of

151
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
Default human

152
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
When we design something

153
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
Whether we clicked it or not

154
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,367
We picture a cyst man

155
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
Were there times in your research

156
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
Were you discovered

157
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
That you yourself for me

158
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,047
Default mail or something

159
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
Absolutely

160
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,631
I mean that's kind of how I got into feminism in the first place

161
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,703
I was realizing that I had this male default in my head

162
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
But whenever I pictured

163
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
Anyone

164
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
And the gender versus pasta

165
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,359
Fidos picturing a man so you never Loya a doctor

166
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
Journalist

167
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
A scientist

168
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
Anyone

169
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,623
Show me picturing men and that was really shocking to me because no tiny

170
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,975
Capital to the fact that I hadn't noticed I was doing it

171
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,303
Because it is really shocking how would I know tonight if I'm a woman how would I know

172
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,887
How to say picture in the opposite sex

173
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,495
And so we really are so used to seeing men as

174
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
The default

175
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
That

176
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
Most people on to wear

177
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,151
That they are ignoring women

178
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,223
Bets for people who are developing

179
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,527
Text people who are developing Place policy

180
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,831
People are developing medical research

181
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
I wrote this book

182
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
Because

183
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,279
People collecting sex disaggregated

184
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
Really serious negative

185
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
Potentially fatal

186
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Results for women

187
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,775
What you mention medical research how is the

188
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,615
Absence of women in data Gathering effects

189
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Medicine

190
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
The vast majority

191
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,527
Of medical research and that's with vast majority of

192
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,599
Knowledge we have is based on the male body

193
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
So true so true

194
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
Diseases

195
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
The way we

196
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,791
Have her sets them the way we treat them

197
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,375
The way we diagnose them as being based on reception men

198
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
Women get misdiagnosed

199
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,215
Play free sample heart attack

200
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,567
Women more likely to die following a heart attack

201
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
The men

202
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,151
I'm not for a whole host of reasons faster which is that

203
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
Female heart attack symptoms

204
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
Not

205
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,783
The horse tack symptoms that we have always been to it

206
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,647
They sent me I had always been taught that I was having chest pain and pain down my left arm

207
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
I was having a heart attack

208
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
Actually

209
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,839
Those are not the typical heart attack symptoms for women

210
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
Experience

211
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,215
Nausea fatigue what feels like indigestion

212
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,543
Answer women realize having off

213
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
So then I go to the doctor

214
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
But even if the Jeep

215
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,455
Doctors don't realize that women having a hot shower

216
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,415
Female heart attack symptoms are seen as a tip

217
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:05,023
Even though they are very typical for women symptoms

218
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
Difficult women

219
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Experience chest

220
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
But we just

221
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,727
Because of this way that we see men as the default

222
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
Male horse like symptoms STD

223
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
And female hashtags

224
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
Symptoms of CNS

225
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
This kind of Niche variant

226
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,455
I was just as stunning because if there was some kind of

227
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
Thing that affected

228
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,807
You'll 51% of the population

229
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,623
We wouldn't think that that is a nice problem

230
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:39,071
We do in all sorts of areas I mean another area that Springs to mind is call crashes

231
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
So

232
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,911
The car crash test dummy that is being used

233
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Used for decades

234
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
EMT test cost

235
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,543
Itching based on a 50th percentile male

236
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,247
Perform male buddies in all sorts of ways I mean we have few neck muscles we have less upper body

237
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
Muscle mass

238
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,343
Spinal columns a different pelvises differ

239
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
NASA visa rules

240
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
Issues that need to

241
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,695
To be taken into account but

242
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
We got this 50th percentile male dummy

243
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,327
As of course the 50th percentile male is the 50th percentile human

244
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
What is quite

245
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
Enraging rainy is it

246
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,055
This was introduced in the 1950s

247
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
About having a female

248
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,967
But as happens so often, manufacturers Lovett against

249
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
On the basis that it would be to expense

250
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
And presumably it doesn't just affect

251
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Bus safety

252
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
They are weak like it that affects the design of the car

253
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Exactly

254
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
The result is that

255
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
Costas

256
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,327
So for example the seat belt

257
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
Hasn't been designed to accommodate women's breasts

258
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,191
We haven't developed a seatbelt that account

259
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
Pregnant

260
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
Similarly

261
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
Women need to sit much for the forge

262
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,711
Reach the pedals of a sequin impulse Apartments Drive

263
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:04,063
What's the standard seating position

264
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
In a frontal Collision

265
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:12,255
Alta Vista means that women are 47% more likely

266
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
Need to be seriously injured

267
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,351
I'm 17% more likely to die than a man

268
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
If I rent a car crash

269
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Answer

270
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,567
That is negligence but I think it gets even worse because it'd have belatedly

271
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,383
Regulations of realize that women do exist

272
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
Bus realized women exist

273
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,063
2015 the EU realized women existed

274
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,647
You mean they finally introduce ya

275
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
Spider-Man

276
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:46,047
Because the car crash test dummy that they are using is not

277
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,607
Anthropometric plea correct

278
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
It's a scaled-down male dummy

279
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
Even worse

280
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
But not this

281
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,103
Is there any used in one out of the five regular

282
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Journey in the passenger seat

283
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,063
You can say based on those tests is that we have Deja on whether it's safe or not to scale down men

284
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
And sit in the passenger seat

285
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,183
Malia Jones station on whether it's a factual

286
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
Undertaker tool

287
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,559
What it's like for someone who might be slightly similar to a woman to drive

288
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:26,495
Things like snow plowing and medical protocols and car safety are just a few instances where there is a crib

289
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Medical data cap

290
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
Either because

291
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,615
There is no data on women or the date of that exists

292
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,151
Is not sex

293
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,967
Even something as innocuous as the width

294
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
A piano key

295
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,831
Has been designed only with male hand sizes in mind

296
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:47,487
The military's across the world marching regulations have been designed based solely on the average male stride

297
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
With Disaster

298
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
Results for female recruits

299
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,471
Construction tools safety equipment building codes smartphones voice recognition software all of it

300
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
It designed using a corpus of data

301
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,335
In which women largely do not exist

302
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
Back after the break

303
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,943
We'll look at another example that might just provide a blueprint

304
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,735
Try to do things better in the future

305
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,647
I've been talking to Caroline criado-perez about her book invisible women and

306
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:20,255
Of all the story is a poor design based on the gender data Gap that Caroline told me

307
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,351
Perhaps the most instructive was the case of the three stone stove

308
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,679
Three stone stove is a traditional form of cooking

309
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
That's used by 80%

310
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
People in the developing world

311
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
It is what it sounds like

312
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,871
Three Stones arranged in a circle on the ground

313
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
With a pot placed on top of

314
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
In a fire underneath

315
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
And the problem with

316
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,527
This type of stove is that

317
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,087
The fumes that are given off are incredibly tok

318
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:50,975
And it's not just that the fumes are really toxic it's how long women and children are exposed to

319
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
3 * 10 * 5 is

320
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
Not very efficient

321
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
So they will be

322
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,911
In a poorly ventilated room

323
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
Two I think one estimate with something

324
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
The equivalent of more than a hundred cigarettes

325
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
Today

326
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
And this seems like something like we've had

327
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,967
Stoves and ovens for quite a long time why wasn't this fixed

328
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
A long time ago did we even try

329
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
Yes sir

330
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
The happiness hack

331
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,135
Spy agencies to develop

332
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
Is clean start

333
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
To be cops

334
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:30,143
But we still have the big problem that is incredible

335
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Simple it's that

336
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,495
The album design

337
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
And asking them

338
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
What they need

339
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
What they want

340
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
How are they liking

341
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
The Current Designs

342
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,991
The issues I mean that's hilariously basic

343
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
They keep developing stoves

344
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,575
That for example

345
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
Increase cooking time

346
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
Are women already cooking for

347
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:58,047
How to spend cooking

348
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,863
They often require

349
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,167
Atmore tending and again

350
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,495
When you having to spend so long cooking

351
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
You need to be able to multitask

352
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,359
This isn't something that is being

353
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Xidan

354
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
1

355
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
Clean

356
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
Start with develop

357
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
They require

358
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
Accession amount

359
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,999
The design is just assumed I will the household will take care of that

360
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
But actually

361
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
Maintenance

362
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
With a mom's job

363
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
An amendment

364
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,031
He starves because they so well why do I need to know she can just cook them the old style.

365
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,335
I want to waste my time

366
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,663
Another one was similar issue

367
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
Stop

368
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,527
Start with cheese small to just put

369
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
Bits of wooden

370
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,855
You have to chop it up again

371
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,671
What is job

372
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
Didn't get to use fees

373
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:05,119
These all these really really simple things that should have been cool at the design stage if

374
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,727
What do you need and they would have said

375
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,519
But we need something.

376
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:16,895
Means that we don't have to spend more time cooking that weakened the cop truck hits while we're doing it

377
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,991
We don't need mental help Swiss because they bite

378
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,087
Programas de program so yeah I'll see ya his failed

379
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
So these really really face it

380
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
How many years are we talking about

381
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
An enzyme

382
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Is that

383
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,143
Often reports that produce the basic he say that it's the woman's fault

384
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,727
The women unwilling to learn how to use the

385
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:47,615
The stove so the women are choosing to cook in these dangerous toxic fumes

386
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
Radius just insulting

387
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:55,551
Yeah I mean it in a 10 minutes remind me to buy call this language in the crash tests

388
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,135
You know that that women are the out-of-position drivers

389
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
And

390
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,463
You know it really does like there's a moment

391
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Where

392
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
Designers in

393
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
People studying this

394
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,143
Finally see women in that is

395
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
Trying to find someone to blame

396
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Yeah I mean

397
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
I student connect this

398
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
254

399
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,943
This position of will they must be something wrong with the women we go to fix the women

400
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,759
That is actually something that we

401
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Apply to Mac

402
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,367
I think it becomes my

403
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
It's clear when you are looking at things

404
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
Place initiative

405
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,839
You know the ideas are what we need to build up women's comfort

406
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,167
Enough said that's why they

407
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
Getting from

408
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,287
Choosing a subject

409
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,895
And yet study after study has shown that she has pretty good at

410
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Assassin

411
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,479
That Bass kill their intelligence

412
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,807
Estimate

413
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Basculin

414
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Intelligence

415
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,135
And so when you see that then you should have

416
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,743
Maybe it's not that the women write themselves

417
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
She likes the men raising themselves

418
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
I was too high

419
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
It just

420
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
We just never think of it like that

421
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,191
The mail is sativa

422
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,239
It's a symbol that must be the right level

423
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
So we got to fix

424
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
What's the weather

425
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,151
Did anyone bother to design a stove based primarily on the input

426
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,223
Of women and if so what what did they create

427
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,575
Have a happy ending

428
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
Say

429
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,159
Yeah a few years ago receptions in India

430
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
Instead of trying to create a holster

431
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Fake creation

432
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,535
This device that you can put on any

433
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
And basically it comes

434
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Woody's

435
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
And cuts

436
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
Smite

437
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
Too comfortable levels

438
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
Very very cheap

439
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
It's used with recycled

440
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
Metal material

441
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,639
And it's being picked up

442
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
Not just in India

443
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,223
You know they're being studies in Kenya and Ghana

444
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
With the same device

445
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
With similarly puzzle

446
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
Results

447
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
Menorah.

448
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,855
And basically

449
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:11,487
Went

450
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
Revolutionary

451
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:20,191
Say what these receptions did that was different was they started off in the basis of what do women actually need

452
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
What do you want

453
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
Provide that

454
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
And say the reception went awesome

455
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
What is the issue

456
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,127
Coming in from above and saying

457
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
You women

458
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
You're very silly of naughty

459
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
Doofus

460
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
I mean when I when I read your blog

461
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
Both

462
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,159
Satisfying and enraging about it is that

463
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
The solution is pretty simple

464
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
It's just

465
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,071
Talk to women gather data

466
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,703
And think of that while you're making things or include women in the process the whole time

467
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
Do you find yourself

468
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
Hopeful

469
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Dispirited angry

470
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:04,479
Incredibly pissed off

471
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,527
Turn off

472
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Is

473
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:15,999
And I'm particularly when it comes to areas that perception

474
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,791
But there was a problem

475
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,959
What's the most shocking thing you found

476
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,335
Because they're all so many shocking things

477
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:36,735
Because there are so many shocking things

478
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
Sensitive numb to it

479
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,951
Women of dying from heart attacks women of dying from unclean cookstoves

480
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,791
Oscar Wilde it's not the examples

481
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
It's the excuse

482
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,863
That make you really angry

483
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,191
To this day I have had

484
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
Notes

485
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:05,919
Entirely friendly exchanges on Twitter

486
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,967
Test on women because they have.

487
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,039
Complicate

488
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
Results

489
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
Yeah

490
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,159
I'm not switching raging because

491
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,696
They must know

492
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
But yes

493
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
.

494
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
De'aaron Fox

495
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:28,192
What you need to know

496
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,544
2019 and I have medical researches

497
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,128
You're trying Vol. Sandman and if we find anything in

498
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
Interesting them will include women

499
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
Which again

500
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
Is positioning malice

501
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Default

502
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,528
And I suppose one of the things that

503
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
Makes me moist

504
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
Angry

505
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
Is

506
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:51,488
Think about how many drugs for women have we missed out on

507
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,328
Because they didn't recommend when we started testing

508
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,400
Deep do you see the

509
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,008
The end of excuses are like is this

510
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,592
I mean are we reaching an end where you can no longer

511
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,664
Have these excuses or is it still just as bad as ever

512
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,504
Not reaching an end

513
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
I am not trying to make you have a

514
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,160
Got a good view of this at all

515
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,488
Is ice crusher your I share your pessimism

516
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
I tell you what you mean you are sweet

517
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,888
How do I feel right in the back

518
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,168
I felt

519
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
Absolutely

520
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,984
Despondent

521
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,824
Since the biggest come out I have felt more

522
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:42,944
And that has been because the response has been actually quite incredible

523
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
Women

524
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,600
The main response

525
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,160
And reaction has just being one of relief

526
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,232
Wow the world suddenly makes sense

527
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,072
I've realized there isn't something wrong with me

528
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
I just

529
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
Have a body that

530
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
Hasn't been

531
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,704
Factored into the design of pretty much anything

532
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
Paternal side for men

533
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
I've had

534
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,616
So many men get in touch

535
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:18,272
Telling me about how they are changing the procedure and how they are changing the procedure and how

536
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,832
Designing

537
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
Incorporation what they have

538
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,952
Read in the book into the way that they

539
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
Projects that they are involved in

540
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
So if you were to

541
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
Describe a solution

542
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,376
You know to make this better

543
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,168
What are beans

544
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:39,520
Let's go for the winter

545
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,920
Sex disaggregated

546
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:49,760
And that she has an amazing thing that happens

547
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
Yesterday

548
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
And I think this is

549
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,928
Biggest win today

550
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,720
With the Scottish government

551
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
Have

552
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
Started a working group

553
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
On collecting

554
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Sex and gender decipher dates

555
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
Fascia

556
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
As a result the book

557
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
And that was

558
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,520
I mean that's just amazing

559
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,688
I admit they are they are great and I'm going to have to move that time because when we brexit

560
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:23,296
Scotland Safe Haven

561
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:30,976
Caroline criado-perez book is called invisible women data bias in a world design firm and it's available

562
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:35,328
Wherever books are sold in a highly recommend you go out and buy a copy because it's filled with

563
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,912
Hundreds of other examples of dendur De Tobias

564
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,776
I will have you questioning the default system and design assumptions of the world around you

565
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
Illuminating and
