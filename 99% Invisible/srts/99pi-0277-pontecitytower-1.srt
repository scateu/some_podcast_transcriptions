This is 99% invisible

22
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352
I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,752
Back in the 1980s when Louise smuts was growing up in Johannesburg South Africa

24
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,592
His family couldn't go outside together without breaking the law

25
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,152
My father would never walk next to my mother

26
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,480
My mother would always walk behind them wherever they went

27
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:30,368
Louis was too young to understand why his parents couldn't be seen together in Johannesburg or as everyone calls

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
Joburg

29
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,464
Louis just saw a world that treated them differently

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,096
Your mother got sick and didn't have a medical Aid should go to a hospital out of the city

31
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
Where is

32
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,192
Meat that you can see what is the temperature

33
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,752
Just around the corner from where we started

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,360
Healthcare it like almost everything else in South Africa was decided by race

35
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:56,992
Louis father was white his mother was colored a local term for people of mixed race

36
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,552
They gotten married in neighboring Swaziland

37
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,368
But back home their marriage was against the law

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,720
When do we was a kid only white people can move freely in cities here

39
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
Live in the nicest neighborhood

40
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,304
Access the best hospitals

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,328
Schools in jobs

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
This is Dawson Woodley

43
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
He's a South African journalist

44
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
Black people on the other hand

45
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
Lived in the crowded outskirts

46
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,848
Which were far from just about everything you'd once in the city

47
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,408
The country's ruling white minority

48
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
Coldest system up at 8

49
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
Which literally translated

50
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
To separate

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
I want to see is one

52
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,232
And I say that is being misunderstood

53
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
Ice cream Justice Easley

54
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,864
That's much better be described

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,168
As a policy of good neighborliness

56
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,776
Apocalypse leaders like Hendrick forefoot

57
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,360
Claim that segregated cities were better for everyone

58
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,176
And apostates was strictly enforced

59
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
Policeman Patrol neighborhoods

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,064
To make sure that white people and black people weren't living together

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
If you lived in a house

62
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
But come knocking on your door

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,024
But the apartheid system was never airtight and people found creative ways to slip through the cracks

64
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
If you lived in a high-rise building with

65
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,192
5/600 flexible inner they weren't going to go through each and every

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
Flight to come and look

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
Xiaomi

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
Illegal person

69
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
You can easily disappear into flat

70
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,456
Over the years many families like Louise

71
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,808
Disappeared into one high-rise apartment building in particular

72
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:41,696
The tower called Ponte City in Johannesburg

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
Everybody knows party

74
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,656
Even looking at joburg Skyline now

75
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
Pontes Hudson MS

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
First of all it's

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
54 stories tall

78
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,616
That makes it the tallest apartment building on the entire African country

79
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,712
And it certainly makes a toilet than any of the other buildings around it

80
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,272
It's also completely secular

81
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
If you want to look at Ponte from above

82
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,416
You see that the center is Justice open hollow-core

83
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,720
Design to allow natural ventilation

84
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
N2 lesson daylight

85
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
The building looks

86
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,839
Kind of like a massive concrete toilet roll

87
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:25,215
It's also got this glowing red billboard for a cell phone company wrapping around the top

88
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
Like a crown

89
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
So wherever you are in the city

90
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
You can easily Spot It

91
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,943
Pontes larger-than-life architecture also comes with a larger-than-life reputation

92
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,759
So many the building symbolizes

93
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Is Johannesburg

94
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,087
Because over the past four decades

95
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,903
Its fortunes have basically murdered the city

96
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Because of its

97
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Fail because of

98
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
5

99
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
It's chicken history

100
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
If toughness is restless

101
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
Cox Chesapeake traffic condition

102
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
That's Melinda Silverman

103
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,263
An architectural historian who studies inner-city Johannes

104
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
Hessberg chastity

105
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
Which guys very rapidly

106
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Three cycles of

107
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
Declining

108
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,735
Prosperity and economy

109
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,671
Auntie has always been kind of a vertical waiting room for admission to South African society

110
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
But it's also been a laboratory

111
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,303
Place where the city seems to try out new versions of itself

112
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,655
Years before Ponte became a hideaway for interracial families like Louise

113
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,471
It attracted a much different clientele

114
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,031
I don't understand who first lived there and why

115
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,079
We have to go back to the 1960s

116
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
Before Ponte was even built

117
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
At the start of the 60s

118
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,783
The apartheid system had been firmly in place for more than 10 years

119
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,623
And South Africa's economy was a rising star in the world

120
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:52,511
It had just given birth to a new currency the Rand which was already stronger than the US dollar

121
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:57,631
The country's success was largely driven by its access to cheap black labour

122
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
And it's rich goldap

123
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
We were the major goal

124
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,495
Producers in the world

125
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,591
And the feeling was that if we could continue being the magical

126
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
What uses and keep and increasing erased

127
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
Black population

128
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
Under control

129
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Futurist

130
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
Radiance

131
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Unless of course

132
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
You were black

133
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
Over the next decade

134
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
Foreign investments in South Africa doubled

135
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,999
But skilled workers were in short supply

136
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,863
Because the government had denied the majority of the population at decent education

137
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:34,239
It had to fill the Gap by recruiting single white men from all of Europe

138
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,871
The country's white population increased by over 50% between 1963

139
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,663
A 1972

140
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
These new coming so a strong economy

141
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
And an idyllic life

142
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
White people

143
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
With a living of privilege

144
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,367
Did you probably couldn't have

145
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Found it

146
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
Any other part of the world

147
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,743
If you were a middle-class person

148
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
Living in an apartment

149
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
In England

150
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
In America

151
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,703
You're probably have had to wash your own dishes and made your own bed

152
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
Where is if you were middle class

153
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Json

154
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
Living

155
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
Is South Africa

156
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
Property head at least

157
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,319
And there was one square mile of in a city joburg the future sites of Ponte Tower

158
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:26,207
That was a regular Landing place for these European migrants in the 1960s and 70s

159
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,279
It was home to the city's most famous bars

160
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
And live music joints

161
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,215
A place where specialty stores sold French magazines Italian shoes and American rock and roll

162
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
Shiny Vibrava

163
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:45,663
That was a regular Landing place for these European migrants in the 1960s and 70s

164
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
It was home to the city's most

165
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Famous bars

166
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
And live music joint

167
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,671
A place where specialty stores sold French magazines Italian shoes and American rock and roll

168
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,743
It had a shiny vibrant Bohemian Edge

169
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,095
The people compared to New York's Greenwich Village all blend in SoHo.

170
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,495
But it was also a place that felt almost like it wasn't in South Africa at all

171
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
Like most of joburg's nicest neighborhoods

172
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,615
This area was zoned exclusively for white people

173
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:22,015
Black South Africans could work there but unless they were live-in servants they had to be out by Nightfall each evening

174
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:27,647
Developers could hardly satisfy the demand for high-rise apartments in this part of the city

175
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
Buildings kept getting bigger and

176
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Toilet

177
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,559
But that wasn't the only thing fueling the development of Joe Biggs new high-rises

178
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
The other

179
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
To drive I would say

180
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
With on your mark

181
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
And it's worthless

182
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
Hold me

183
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
Saints of what

00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
Economy

186
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,175
These are good times

187
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
This was why people want

188
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,759
Make the mark on the lens

189
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Skype

190
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
South Africa

191
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,367
Martin Progressive

192
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
Impressive

193
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Place

194
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:06,047
Of course South Africa was neither truly modern no Progressive at this

195
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,119
This was the era of African Independence

196
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
Across the continent

197
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,983
Old colonies with falling like dominoes

198
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
And by the mid-1960s

199
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
Most African countries with black rule

200
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
This decade

201
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,687
Is it decade of African Independence

202
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,783
The people have got to see their freedom as more than a local trial

203
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,623
The only all African Dominion in the British Commonwealth

204
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,695
In the new Africa one more independent country

205
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,191
Tomatoes World South Africa's white government was starting to look pretty backward

206
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,847
And it didn't help that the country had recently thrown several of the anti-apartheid movement most powerful leaders in jail for

207
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,175
4life including a young lawyer named Nelson Mandela

208
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,807
Petrovic new buildings kept getting bigger and more audacious

209
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,647
Almost as if the government was trying to prove its wilikina

210
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:09,791
By the early 1970s huge skyscrapers with sprouting up across central jovic

211
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
Including plenty

212
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
Monkey starts of being

213
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
Tala

214
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
Around town

215
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
That's architect

216
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
Rodney kruska

217
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,543
It was one of the three architects who designed the bull

218
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
So now I'm watching the game

222
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,455
With a Halo down the middle

223
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
The whole outside of it

224
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
It is made out of

225
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
Ruel concrete

226
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
Unpainted

227
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Unpolished

228
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
And then at its foot

3D anchor

230
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
So beautiful

231
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
People

232
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:47,423
Once Upon a Time City looks a bit like a wedding cake but not everyone agreed the building but beautiful

233
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,983
Some thought it look like an ugly brutalist

234
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
Wedding cake

235
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
Straight off the boat

236
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
It was voted as the second ugliest building in Japan

237
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
Not even the honor of being the first ugliest

238
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
The second ugliest

239
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
When can you reenlist chicken nuggets

240
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
Second ugliest or not

241
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Tontitown AR was popular

242
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,207
President started moving in even before the building was finished

243
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,535
Lord bites furnished Flats in panoramic city views

00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,351
All the units in Ponte Facebook Inward and outward

245
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,423
With entrances wrapping around the central core

246
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,799
From one side of the building you could see the entire downtown Skyline

247
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:29,407
From another you could catch entire rugby matches at the city's main stadium

248
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,247
By the time Ponte was completed in 1975

249
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,551
It's 470 Flats

250
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Warren Heideman

251
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,671
Switzerland allergies about how I'll just going to use as much

252
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,999
Electricity is as every small town in

253
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,839
People in the every small town in South Africa

254
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:52,959
The developers thought that way to on pontes ground floor they built an elaborate shopping mall

255
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,543
And schemed about putting a miniature ski slope in the open core

256
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
So we had restaurants

257
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
Butcher Baker Candlestick maker

258
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,991
Desiindy next bison

259
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
As a little city

260
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:13,439
But even as pontes new residents were moving in the city around them with cracking apart

261
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,279
At this time Johannesburg center city was almost exclusively White

262
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,095
Black South Africans lived on the edges of the city

263
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
In communities called Township

264
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
And 12 Mile

265
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
Southwest Aponte

266
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,495
In a black Township called Soweto

267
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
A new revolt

268
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:32,895
Against apartheid had begun

269
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,479
Language they regarded

270
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,551
Is Nautica manifestation of urban black frustration

271
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
Protest escalated

272
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,159
And on June 16th 1976

273
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,255
Police killed at least 276 High School

274
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
During a peaceful protest

275
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:55,423
Images of the massacre quickly circled the globe inspiring renewed Kohl's

276
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
To end white rule

277
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:02,335
As Apollo smoke Rises over this black community

278
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,663
Minority

279
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
Calling or coming under greater pressure

280
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,111
The Soweto Uprising also sent joburg's urban planning dreams crashing

281
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:19,231
The June 16th Uprising and the international sanctions in boycotts that followed

282
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
How to destroy the country's economy

283
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,631
It became difficult to keep all the newly constructed high-rises

284
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
Fully occupied

285
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
And it wasn't just the crashing economy

286
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:34,591
Like many cities around the world Johannesburg had started to experience a wave of suburbanization

287
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,431
When white people moving out of the inner city and into new suburb

288
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,807
Meanwhile many black South Africans were fleeing from the poverty and violence of the townships

289
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,879
For them the inner city was an alluring option

290
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Especially

291
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
Ponte

292
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,975
Physical effects they would have been more affordable

293
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
Really good location

294
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,095
The ability to be really near to

295
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,423
The wig places that still existed in the Inner City

296
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
In the 1980s

297
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
It was still illegal for black

298
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,359
Indian and coloured South Africans to live in these areas

299
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:12,223
But the scale and density of the inner city made the laws harder to enforce

300
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,295
Unlimited reading hot dance

301
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
Petit living offered which means that

302
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
People

303
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,927
Quit being less conspicuous

304
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,255
Ephedra legal in Italian

305
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Gentleman

306
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
Black lady as wife

307
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
Is a French gentleman

308
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,935
Who old Santa colored

309
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Why

310
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
That's Louis smuts again

311
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,335
Whose parents were in an illegal interracial marriage

312
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:43,967
He's talking about some of the other families who also lived in Ponte in the early 1980s

313
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,295
As the lines between Black and Whites began to

314
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
South Africans coined a new term for the phenomenon

315
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
Decoded Graham

316
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,511
For Louie gray areas were in Escape

317
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:02,143
Auntie was a place where his family could be together freely without fear of arrest or public scrutiny

318
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,543
I don't even remember seeing any building rides or anything like that you almost had protection being

319
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
In

320
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
The flashlight

321
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
Denial because so many places

322
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,247
Going to a flight yet going to reflect

323
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,855
You know they went thank you close down a whole block of flats at 1

324
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
But that doesn't mean that they weren't

325
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,487
Stresses associated with life in Ponte

326
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:34,143
Police regularly set up checkpoints to monitor who came in and out of black and white areas of

327
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,727
When Louise family went through these checkpoints

328
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
His mother would sit in the back seat

329
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
Posing as the families made

330
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
She have to sit in the back

331
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,687
Is plain and simple as that she sat in the back

332
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,039
Black and colored people who illegally settled in the Inner City

333
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,343
Also strike a hard bargain

334
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,439
Landlords who turn a blind eye to the color of the residents skin

335
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,023
And residents would have to turn a blind eye to Rising rents

336
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
Improvement

337
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,863
The stages of illegality

338
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
I think

339
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,239
With absolutely critical to the decline because

340
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,359
You are an illegal tenant you have no protection of the law

341
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
Sol ring

342
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
Canby rent

343
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
Any rain for rent

344
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,735
How do you fold the ring

345
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
You sublet

346
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,647
The rain stopped even further and then you sublet even more

347
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
Inside Ponte

348
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,487
Apartment started to get crowded in grimy

349
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
Plumbing broke down

350
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,399
Trash begin to fill the open core in the center of the building like an oversized concrete garbage can

351
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,959
There were giant piles of old mattress

352
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Furniture in rubble

353
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:48,639
Eventually Legend spread that the trash and piled up so high it reads the 14th story of a building

354
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,991
Pretty soon Banks stopped issuing Home Loans in the area

355
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
And white people kept moving out

356
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,087
By the late 1980s

357
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,183
What you thought of Ponte and the surrounding neighborhood called hillbrow

358
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,255
Probably depends a lot on the color of your skin

359
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
1 Suburban

360
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
Would it be until 5

361
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
And he'll probably be the place

362
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
Who is acting for people in

363
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,055
That is mostly black and colored people

364
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,151
Beacon of opportunity

365
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
Your way into the sea

366
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,271
Your way of experiencing urban life

367
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:33,951
And all these changes in the inner city where fish are doing a much bigger change that was about to happen to all

368
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:40,095
On February 2nd 1990 then president FW de klerk

369
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,679
When some friendship Parliament to give his annual state of the nation

370
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,407
Three decades the apartheid government headband mini anti-apartheid political parties

371
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,735
They rested their members and sometimes forced them into exile

372
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,575
No one was expecting the president to announce the end of that attract

373
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
He shocked nearly everyone

374
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
Watching

375
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:09,791
The prohibition of the African National Congress the pan africanist Congress the South African Communist Party

00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
He's being December

377
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,983
The government has taken a firm decision

378
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,799
To release mr Mandela unconditionally

379
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,127
This beats would change the course of South African history

380
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,199
A week later after 27 years in prison

381
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
For treason

382
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,759
Nelson Mandela was free

383
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
And after Decades of struggle

384
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,367
The end of Apartheid was suddenly internet

385
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,207
From all over the world exiled political activist began to return

386
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,535
They wanted to help shape a dramatically changing country

387
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
50 + 19

388
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
91

389
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
The year that we came back

390
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,823
That's lenswear most likely an anti-apartheid activist who fled South Africa in 1980

391
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,895
Like many other returning exiles

392
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:02,527
Lynchwood took advantage of the centrality and cheap rental Vienna City

393
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
And moved into a friends

394
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,391
24th floor apartment in Ponte Tower

395
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,951
Ponte and the surrounding neighborhood

396
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
Webb still run down

397
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:17,119
Butlins way was surprised to find the area felt a lot like the Westin City

398
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
What he'd spent the past decade

399
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
That's where the music was happy

400
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
54 hour

401
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
Food Outlets that we're Nazi

402
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Send anywhere

403
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Weather

404
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
So goodnight sweetheart

405
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Throughout

406
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
Yeah it was like

407
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
Get big in jail

408
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,855
Some of the old European cafes from the 50s and 60s were still standing

409
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Serving late night

410
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
Espressos and thick schnitzel

411
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,719
But alongside them were new shop

412
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
What's a nightclub

413
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,815
Including one run by the famous South African Trumpeter

414
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,143
Hugh Masekela with recently returned from his own Exxon

415
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,335
So if you wanted to find anybody

416
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Who are around

417
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Instead

418
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,087
McCartney says they stayed up all night

419
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,183
Talking about the future of danu country over beers and Brandy's

420
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,535
Thabo mbeki who would later become president of South Africa

421
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
Lived in the building next to Ponte

422
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:24,191
At the time of the first democratic election in 1994

423
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,031
One Observer counted 50 of the new members of parliament

424
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,103
Staying in Ponte and the surrounding area

425
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:36,223
But the end of Apartheid didn't represent the end of Ponte Towers evolution

426
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,855
The transition to Black rule in South Africa also meant the end of the countries tightly closed borders

427
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:47,743
Which four decades have cracked open only for white immigrants and a few laborers from the surrounding countries

428
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
Throughout the 1990s

429
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,607
Immigrants began arriving in Johannesburg by the

430
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
Tens of thousands

431
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,191
And many of them landed in panties

432
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,711
That's footage from a film called Africa shafted by Ingrid Mountain

433
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,783
She filmed entirely inside a panties elevator

434
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:15,135
That's why it sounds like the doors opening and shutting in the background world

435
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:19,232
Martin's found people from dozens of countries living in the building

436
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,560
Mostly in crowded Apartments shared by several families

437
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,352
Some had come for work

438
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,912
Others were fleeing political persecution

439
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,960
They shared one importance

440
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,496
Experience with past residents

441
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,568
For them Ponte was a place you could start over

442
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
I just wouldn't give

443
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,920
Malaysia boy the life that I never had

444
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:47,136
Over the years Ponte like South Africa itself continued to have its ups and downs

445
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:51,488
By the late 90s the building's physical decline made it a Haven for criminals

446
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,328
Who moved into the building and ran out like a vertical slum

447
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,656
Appunti Still Remains in place of Big Ideas

448
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,704
Nice and wild experimentation

449
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,848
Developments made a few attempts to gentrify the tower and turn it into luxury apartments again

450
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
But ultimately those plans

451
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
Didn't really work

452
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,784
Punchy today remains a lot like it was at the end of Apartheid

453
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:19,136
A home for recently arrived immigrants from all of Africa

454
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,560
On a recent Saturday morning at pair of kids are battling it out on a foosball table at the base of Punta

455
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,632
You can tell it's a close game

456
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:38,336
Just down the road people are crowding around a wall That's covered in hundreds of scribbled slips of paper

457
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,128
In several different languages

458
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,480
Summit on a stack of the older ones with WhatsApp bubble gum

459
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,040
It's a sort of analog Craigslist

460
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:51,392
A message board for newcomers searching for accommodation in Ponte

461
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,928
And around hillbrow

462
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,232
I'm looking for a lady

463
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:59,584
Balcony at 1801 Metropolitan

464
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
And the list goes on

465
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,752
Sifting through the messages that the Monfils Limitless

466
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
Lake South Africa itself

467
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:14,688
Ponte has gone from a symbol of white opulence to something far more complicated

468
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
It's hopeful

469
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,016
And it's a little rough around the edges

470
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,576
It's a microcosm of the country's history

471
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,880
That's also a place that moves on

472
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,232
And the stream concrete tube at the center of joburg skyline

473
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:31,072
Continues to play the same role for newcomers that it always has

474
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
The same

475
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:38,752
You know they might have been cheaper to vacuum Portuguese Italians of dance living in helper

476
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
Then what novel

477
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,360
Pomeranians and garlands Nigeria

478
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Zimbabweans

479
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,040
It's voice has been your entry point into the city

480
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:09,216
So did Ponte Tower seem Vaguely Familiar but you can't quite put your finger on it

481
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,800
Cuz you probably saw it or at our inspired by it

Epilogue about Pontius life on screen

484
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,976
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

485
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,536
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

486
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:39,168
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

487
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:44,544
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remedy for all hearing.

488
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,848
Voice technology talk to us

489
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,152
It is a creation of Sonic trash

490
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,968
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

491
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:57,600
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology to make them more human

492
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,696

It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake

498
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,240
Human and adding and some thoughtful sound

499
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,056
Makes for a much more natural experience

500
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
Turn the living room lights on

501
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,688

We need to talk about something constipation abdominal pain and bloating

510

You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

Dot and Bo

518
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,056
You know we only heard option Woodley's voice in this episode it was reported by two people actually

519
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,640
Second reporter is Ryan Braun and she was a resident

520
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
Ponte Tower

521
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,712
And it done a lot of reporting on the place

522
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,016
And what are things about Ponty

523
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,832
That is pretty interesting is that even though you might not know it's

524
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,136
Bible History or even know its name

525
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
You might

526
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:40,768
I feel like it's kind of familiar as a place and the reason is because

527
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
It has been two picked

528
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
In movies and dinner

529
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,888
And I asked Brian to talk to me about

530
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,680
The party is actually made

531
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
Quite a number of

532
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,520
Cameos in film and other popular culture

533
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,104
Most recently in the last Resident Evil

534
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,920
Some as a site of the zombie apocalypse

535
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:04,832
It was in District 9 a few years ago and the robots becoming human story

536
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
Chappie

537
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:12,000
A couple years ago to me on a number of other films too interesting Lee not always films

538
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,304
Comforter set in Johannesburg but always

539
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
Films that are set in places where

540
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,424
There's something either kind of apocalyptic or just

541
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,240
Gritty and Messi going on

542
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,800
Right it has that Vibe it's not necessarily

543
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,592
Johannesburg by bits the

544
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
It's the vibe of apocalypse

545
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
Apps that it gives off

546
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,224
Yeah totally but you know you have to sort of wonder where it where did

547
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,624
Filmmakers get the idea that Punta would be the scene for the apocalypse and I think it's rooted in the kind of stereotypes that people have about the

548
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
Intercity of

549
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Johannesburg

550
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:45,536
Which are then intern you know rooted and I think the fear is that a lot of South Africans have about the city in

551
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
And what it's become

552
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,096
Since the end of Apartheid

553
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,656
And there's also a number of films where

554
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
It's not it's early

555
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,776
Ponte works on esterly Johannesburg but there's this

556
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
The idea of

557
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Tower

558
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,616
That's a city in of itself

559
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
That is its own sort of

560
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
Dark place

561
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,992
Dread for example reminds me of the way that

562
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
About Ponte city as well

563
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:12,672
Yeah exactly I know an interesting thing about dread is that the movie itself was filmed in Johannesburg

564
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,488
And they didn't use Conte as assets but then

565
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
There's a sort of

566
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
Massive

567
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,632
Apartment Tower in in the in the Selma 200 story building

568
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,960
It has a hollow open course

569
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,520
So you have to wonder if you know where they got that idea

570
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Right

571
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,104
Why do you think it's so evocative why do you think

572
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
Confused in this way

573
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Are you

574
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
Troubled by

575
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,992
And anyway or is there no are you kind of

576
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Please when you

577
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,344
And I think the way it's come to be as a combination of

578
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
Two things and the one is that

579
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,928
Ponte has become the sort of

580
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
Metaphor for

581
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:52,608
Johannesburg in for South Africa and this kind of outsize thing on the skyline on Twitch people can project their fears

582
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,632
Pisidian weather

583
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
Becoming and I think

584
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,216
Filmmakers have just picked up on that

585
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,496
And then the other thing is is

586
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,800
The aesthetic is to of the building is just

587
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,360
Pretty wild I mean it's just the sort of

588
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
50 stories of raw

589
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,712
Brutal concrete it's got these kind of

590
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
Exposed

591
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,576
Concrete ribs on the inside the chorus just this crazy

592
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,368
Rocky space

593
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,904
You stare up and there's like

594
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,696
50 stories of windows

595
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
Staring back down at you and this

596
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
Start of shaft of light

597
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,840
Almost otherworldly sword has this very cinematic

598
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
Quality to it

599
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
I do find the

600
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:30,496
Do you know the way it appears in popular culture troubling because I think it's sort of

601
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,800
Freezes in time this very negative

602
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
Vision of Johanna

603
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,664
Speargun this vision of Ponte in Ponte and Johannesburg both

604
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,224
Have changed and are changing you know

605
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,016
Assertive extraordinary quickly I thinking

606
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,832
Anybody know about any City but I think

607
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,112
Johannesburg is a

608
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,416
Tickly unsentimental kind of

609
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
City in sky

610
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:56,096
It was started as this sort of mining town was up it's always been a place where people just came to make money to get rich to go

611
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
Get ahead

612
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,912
You don't have this kind of sentimental attachment

613
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:02,240
Home in Johannesburg in into the city sort of moves on

614
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,288
And forgets very quickly but then

615
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,568
When you have

616
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:11,712
The Arbiters of popular culture when you have filmmakers come in and create this or you know start of reinforce this vision of

617
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,760
Joe Berger of 20 as these

618
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,784
Is really dangerous

619
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,344
Scritti crime-ridden spaces a kind of

620
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,904
Freezes that image in people's minds and that's

621
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
Setopati

622
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
I think the city is like

623
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
Whether or not

624
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
It still is

625
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
And you live there for a time right

626
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,864
I did I lived there for about a year coinciding with

627
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,912
Filming of the Resident Evil movie

628
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,008
I was treated to a number of days of the zombie apocalypse

629
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,824
And literally zombies wandering through my building

630
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
Screaming

631
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,176
Logical endpoint to this

632
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:46,016
Conte metaphor

633
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,344
If 20 * 2 represents

634
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,368
Sort of

635
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,440
Chaotic way that Johannes Berg has evolved since the end of

636
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:59,584
Apartheid in and thus the disarray of the city in that. I mean represents disarray more than a

637
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
Zombie apocalypse

638
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:10,592

Series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

665
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,768

Comic mystery

667
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:37,120
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

668
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
We're looking the part

669
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,192
Might cost you your life

670
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:45,568
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

671
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,920
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

672
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,248
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

673
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
A dad

674
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,624
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

675
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,928
Actually if I'm being honest

676
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,976
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that

677
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:10,656
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

678
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,984
Was found dead in my private gym

679
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,312
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

680
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,664
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

681
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,688
Now

682
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,736
I need to clear my name

683
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:31,136
