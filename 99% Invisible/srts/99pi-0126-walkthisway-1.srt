13

This is 99% invisible

30
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
I'm Roman Mars

31
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,976
In 2005 I took a job at WBEZ in Chicago

32
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,024
And I was so excited to be moving there

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
I was excited about the job

34
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,376
But I was also very excited

35
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
About

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
Sigrid

37
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,520
The streets of Chicago and the address numbering system are beautiful

38
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,128
Starting from the 00 access point downtown streets conform to a rigid

39
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
Grid pattern

40
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,200
Were the major streets are exactly

41
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
One mile apart

42
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
And have address numbers which are multiples of eight hundred you don't really have to be able to picture this but I know that if you know it you're not in your head

43
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,952
Seriously but just know that it's amazing

44
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
And I was mesmerized by

45
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,816
So much so that I made flashcards with

46
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
Chicago street names on one side

47
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,680
And the corresponding address number on the other

48
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
So that my wife and I cook with ourselves

49
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,824
On a 2000 mile road trip from San Francisco to Chicago

50
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
Yes I was always like this

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
Division is 1200 North

52
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,528
Armitage is 2000 North and therefore one mile north of division

53
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,368
After living in the jumble of San Francisco streets for years

54
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
Daughter moving to a place

55
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,304
Were people playing the city to help people know where they were and where they were going

56
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,352
My lizard brain

57
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
And gave me peace

58
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,712
As humans have developed cities and built environment we have also needed to develop ways to find our way through

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,552
Signage goes back at least as far as the Roman Empire

60
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,368
They constructed Milestones along the roadway

61
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,000
Which is to say if you're relying on anything besides natural features to help you find your way around

62
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,608
You are relying on things made by people whose job it is is to help us

63
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,424
Figure out how to get from all of our respective point is

64
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,448
Do your point B

65
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:26,080
A producer Sam Greenspan would like me to tell you that he has a fantastic sense of direction

66
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
I really do

67
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,664
I'm sure I get lost sometimes I'll minute

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
It's the worst

69
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
I get so mad at myself on happens but now

70
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
My life is completely different

71
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,832
Ever since I started thinking about what it means

72
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
And wayfinding is a thing

73
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,440
Wayfinding innocence

74
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,304
Is a branch of environmental graphic design concerned with helping people find their way

75
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,632
I love knowing this because now

76
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
When I get lost at the hospital or

77
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
Complicated freeway interchange or

78
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
At an airport

79
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
I have someone to blame

80
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,872
Yeah that's one way to look at it but lot of times it has nothing to do with the signage

81
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
User error does apply sometimes

82
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Fair enough

83
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
Let me introduce you to Jim Harding

84
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
My name is Jim Harding

85
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,624
I'm an environmental graphic designer basically I tell people where to go

86
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,512
There's an environmental graphic designer wayfinder or maybe just a kid with magic marker behind every sign

87
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,071
Turn here to merge onto the 101

88
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
Concourse C is this way

89
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
Bathrooms

90
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
Straight ahead

91
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
But there is a lot

92
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983
Lot more wayfinding than just say

93
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,799
Signage is probably the least

94
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
Effective tool away funny

95
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
Good architecture is one of the best

96
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
It's not that Jim hate sign

97
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,991
Rather the best forms of wayfinding are

98
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
Invisible

99
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
They're baked into the built environment

100
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,159
I first heard about Jim Harding through a writer named David zweig

101
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
I'm David zweig I'm a writer my book

102
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
Is called

103
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:52,095
Invisibles the power of anonymous work in an age of relentless

104
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Self promote

105
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,983
David zweig book is a series of portraits of people whom he refers to as invisible

106
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,799
Invisibles are people who are

107
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
Highly-skilled professionals

108
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,871
People who are really important

109
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Whatever

110
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:11,295
Enterprise are Endeavor that they are part of that their work really has a big effect on the overall outcome be at who are

111
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,831
Largely unknown

112
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
Never thought of by

113
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
By the public or the end-user

114
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:19,231
Jim Harding director of environmental graphics for Gresham Smith and partners

115
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
Is one such invisible

116
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
Jim Harding is one of the best in the business

117
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,375
Jim work on the new international terminal

118
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,703
Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta Georgia

119
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
The world's busiest

120
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:35,871
100 million passengers move through it every year all of them needing to know where to go

121
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,919
Cylons are so important

122
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,247
Cuz you can see your destination you don't have to rely on side

123
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,039
I meant gym at the Atlanta airport

124
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
And he walked me through some of the Cutting Edge wayfinding

125
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Techniques that

126
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,415
He employed at the new international

127
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
National Terminal

128
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
Like right when you walk in from Curbside

129
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,839
Physical space tells you everything you need to know about how to move through it

130
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
Without you even realize

131
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
What started the first thing you want when you enter the airport

132
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
The ticket

133
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
You're not

134
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,823
Lined up on on a 90 degree axis angle

135
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Okay

136
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:13,247
A lot of times the ticket counter to meet you head on when you walk in and then you're left Wonder okay if I go left or right

137
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,599
What is angled ticket counters subtly push you in the right direction

138
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
The angle

139
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
Stairs you

140
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
Down and around a ticket counter

141
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
And heading toward the

142
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
Go to checkpoint

143
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
As a counter is pushing you

144
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:31,679
You're also getting pulled by this giant three-story glass window that looks out onto the tarmac

145
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,519
UC playing to see the apron the jetway where the planes are parking

146
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,823
And so intuitively your drawing

147
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,431
Do you're playing cuz that's what you want to go you want to get on that plane right and there are less obvious

148
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,479
Excuse to like the tile pattern

149
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,039
In the floor absolutely they see the grid

150
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,343
Instead of being on a 90 degree axis

151
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
It's only 45

152
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,695
Annie's tiles going off at a 45 degree angle

153
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
They just begging you to follow them

154
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,327
It's so if you do that you inevitably head toward security

155
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,631
But there's even more going on in the floor than that

156
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
And here's where this gets a little banana

157
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
You turn around and look back here Sammy

158
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
You see where the black

159
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,823
Starts at the door curbside

160
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,687
There's another set of tiles inside the dominant grid pattern that I didn't even notice it first

161
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,343
It starts black and then it's joined by a set of yellow goldish tiles the kind of Cleves out this corridor

162
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Negative space

163
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,927
Which cut straight through the hall going directly

164
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
To security

165
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,023
I already have my ticket I'm not checking any bags

166
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
I will need

167
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,095
Check in on at

168
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,655
The counter I just Follow The Yellow Brick Road song

169
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
I think that

170
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Exactly what this is

171
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,359
Light bulb

172
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
It's pretty cool

173
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,455
And all this Jim says is 100% intent

174
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Absolutely

175
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
Are interior designers

176
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
Just went through a number

177
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
Flooring pattern design scheme

178
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
Until we arrived at this one

179
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
On the other side of the

180
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,535
Security we enter what Jim Harding calls the transition Hall

181
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
Here's where traveler has some decisions to

182
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Weather defined

183
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
Here or whether to get together

184
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
The Concourse

185
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
Take a Subway call the plane train for that

186
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
Or whether to head to baggage claim

187
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,335
This is the part where passengers are going to be asking themselves

188
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Where am I

189
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
Where am I going

190
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,711
Paladar the best way to get there

191
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
Where there are decisions to be made

192
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
This is where wayfinding is needed the most

193
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,415
Yeah the visual wayfinding which is the signage

194
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Now that you can see each

195
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Chicken read it

196
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
You can interpret it

197
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
Bajwa round

198
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,351
There's also information desk and a newfangled interactive display

199
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
I walk with Jim towards the gate

200
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,191
Pictures of seven of nine

201
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
So it looks like the odds are on the left

202
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
All right

203
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,383
That's funny to see there

204
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
This Concourse is pretty streamline

205
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
Elegant

206
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:57,343
But at older less well-designed concourses which are definitely present at some other parts of the ATL Airport

207
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,671
This is where you find yourself in a visual morass

208
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
You've seen this before

209
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,815
Neon signs and brightly-coloured displays all trying to get you to buy magazines

210
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
Nicolo's

211
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Or hot dogs

212
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
We have advertising

213
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,471
Yeah concessions marketing

214
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,799
All those visual elements compete with the primary message of just

215
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
How to navigate to airport

216
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,919
Answer the key here is to make the signage Stand Out by being dull

217
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
And drab

218
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
And playing

219
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
Yeah it's very neutral

220
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,807
Neutral palette gray and white basically

221
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
So you can spot the signs just like

222
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
Tuning out all the glitch

223
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
Now even though this new international

224
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
Terminal is fairly minimal

225
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,023
There are still people trying to sell you stuff

226
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,095
Just beyond the transition Hall towards the gates there's

227
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
This to level Commerce area

228
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,471
There shopping at ground level and then up an escalator are some food options

229
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,311
And of course it's all angle perfectly so you have a direct line of sight

230
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
Into all the shops as your walk

231
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Nearby

232
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
Is unintentional decide to have a shopping Down Below in the

233
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
The food up above

234
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Yes

235
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Why is that

236
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
Well more curb appeal

237
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,319
For your retail tenants

238
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
People

239
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,927
If they're hungry they're going to go find the food wherever it is

240
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
Right

241
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,767
Airports in a struggle to

242
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
To generate Revenue

243
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
Really yeah

244
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
And so anything they can do

245
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,703
To help increase non-aeronautical Revenue

246
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
Thanks that are not generated Bob

247
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
Playing on Airline

248
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
So

249
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,615
Improving their concessions

250
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
And Retail

251
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
Yeah they get a percentage

252
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
Of all those sales

253
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,831
And that's when I realize why there are people like Jim Harding who are paid to do this work

254
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
It's not just at airports one

255
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
To have a pleasant experience

256
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,975
It's because there's money on the table

257
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Think about it

258
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,839
So you're trying to make a connecting flight you don't have a lot of time you don't know where you're going

259
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
I'm stressed

260
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,679
And I don't think I'm going to catch my flight

261
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
Am I going to take time to open my wallet

262
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
Techno

263
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,359
But if I'm cool calm collected I found my gay and I know where I'm going

264
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,919
I'm more likely to stop and buy whatever

265
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
So

266
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Yeah that's where we fighting

267
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
Has a real

268
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
My financial impact

269
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
Yale to airport

270
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Bottom line

271
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
Until it turns out

272
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,511
Wayfinding isn't just about helping you figure out how to get where you want to go

273
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,143
It's about steering the masses anywhere that companies hiring the wayfinders want the masses

274
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
To be steered

275
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
How much more

276
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:25,311
If your consumer choices aren't going to make money for the powers-that-be inside of a closed system like

277
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Beijing Airport

278
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Don't plan on the making it easy

279
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,455
David zweig the writer who introduced me to Jim Harding

280
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:36,319
He noticed this kind of thing to their job isn't always about creating the best system

281
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
For us

282
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
The Traveler

283
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Sometimes it's

284
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
Who's paying their bill

285
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
When I

286
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
Flew to Florida

287
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
With my family

288
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
We

289
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
Going to Fort Lauderdale

290
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
And we

291
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Who is wig

292
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
Chose an off-site car rent

293
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Rookie

294
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
Yeah big mistake

295
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
We thought I'll say it but you take a shuttle bus

296
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,871
Well what happened when you arrived there

297
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
There's

298
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,967
Huge signs for her to give us all the companies were there

299
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,807
If you're trying to find the off-site car rental companies good luck

300
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,623
Even if you try doing that with two little kids until

301
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,743
David mention this to Jim Harding wayfinding failure and he said well

302
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
The airport

303
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
Is far more interested

304
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
And helping out the people who are paying them

305
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,703
Who have on-site facilities they have no incentive to have you leave the airport

306
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Let's go to someone else

307
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Generate no Revenue

308
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Yeah so they're young

309
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
Citizen

310
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,687
Yeah that's not to say though that there's not the Sara Lee a dichotomy between capitalism

311
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
Good user experience

312
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,295
Why do we do what we do for a living is wayfinders

313
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
I think it is to

314
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
In a little way

315
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,463
Improve overall quality of life that that they customer experience

316
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
Passenger experience

317
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:53,375
Is he working a project like the international terminal in Atlanta you want me working for years

318
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
And

319
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
After all that time

320
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
It's built

321
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,263
Can you get to walk through it you see like we are today

322
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,591
You see people using the space understanding the space

323
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
They aren't stressed

324
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,175
The freaking out about missing a flight

325
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
It's like okay

326
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Wow

327
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
Call work

328
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
We did a good job

329
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,623
And you just come away with a nice sense of satisfaction

330
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,695
Welcome aboard the plane train

331
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,351
In theory wayfinding should work whether you're literate in it or not

332
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,447
Learning to see the subtle wayfinding cues in the built landscape

333
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
Can help you understand

334
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,519
How you make your decision

335
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,639
Or I can make you question if you're the one even making your own decisions at all

336
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
After I parted ways

337
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
Jim Harding I passed a food

338
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
And I noticed

339
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,551
Right outside in the floor where these big black

340
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
Curvy tiles

341
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,111
And actually seem to be

342
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Steering people

343
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
Towards the concessions

344
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
So you know

345
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:55,071
Next time you find yourself at an airport food court eating a Cinnabon that you didn't even want

346
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
Check out the sign-in

347
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
The shape of the tiling

348
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
The height of the ceiling

349
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
The quality of the light

350
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
It may just be

351
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,567
Do you have an environmental graphic designer to blame

352
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
But you know

353
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
User error does imply

354
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:29,375
99% invisible was produced this week by Sam Greenspan with Katie mingle Avery

355
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,775
We are project 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco and produce of the offices of arcsin

00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:40,383
Our favorite Architecture Firm in beautiful Downtown Oakland California

357
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
Between the beats

358
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,015
Bongs and chatter of our devices

359
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
We're immersed

360
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,599
The cluttered World a man-made sound

361
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
If

362
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

363
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,863
Call hearing.

00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Technology

365
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
He talked to us

366
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,959
It is a creation of Sonic trash

367
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,031
