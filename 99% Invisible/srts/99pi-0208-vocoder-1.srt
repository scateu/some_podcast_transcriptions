This is 99% invisible

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,264
In 1939 an astonishing new machine debuted at the World's Fair in New York City

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
It was called the voter

27
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,872
Short for voice operating demonstrator

28
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,176
It looks sort of like a futuristic Churchill

29
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,224
That's our own Delaney Hall

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
An operator

31
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
Known as a voter at

32
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,344
Would sit at a curved wooden console

33
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,464
Behind her there was a huge wall with an art deco image of a man's face

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,768
The spirals of curly hair

35
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
His mouth was a giant speaker

36
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,168
The butter Atwood Place her hands on two keyboards in front of her Peach with

37
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
5 or 6 white keys

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
Should use our feet to work to pedals down below

39
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
But instead of musical notes

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,360
The machine produced a voice

41
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,992
That would you happen repeat that in a hypothyroid

42
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,088
And now in his best pay

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,792
This is from a demo recording of the voter produced in 1939 around the same time as the World's Fair

44
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,888
Each of the keys on the keyboard control the particular frequency band

45
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,032
1 foot pedal controlled pitch and the other foot pedal controlled whether the sound would be muffled or

46
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:25,920
Operating this machine required incredible precision and skill

47
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:31,296
Boater hats with train for up to a year to make the voter actually talk like a person

48
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
Or

49
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
Sing like a pro

50
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
About to sing a song for us

51
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,464
Weather

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,328
Well how about Auld Lang Syne

53
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,544
Remember this is all happening totally lie

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
Motorhead is not triggering pre-recorded words

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Instead

56
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
The keys and pedals of the voter

57
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,248
Imitate the effects of the human vocal tract

58
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,064
Releasing the most basic building blocks of speech

59
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:09,440
The butter at is playing them in an intricate sequence and she's actually synthesizing speech

60
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
Real time

61
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,888
The crowds at the World's Fair went crazy

62
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
What is Talking Machine

63
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
It created a sensation

64
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
This is John Paul

65
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,568
He's an engineer inventor and his story

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,664
It was the first time there had ever been

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
Working speech synthesis

68
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Anywhere's

69
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,088
People had no conception that you could even do it

70
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,392
There's voters imitation of a cow

71
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
Was invented by

72
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
And Homer Dudley

73
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,448
Area of expertise was Speech science

74
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:57,568
Dudley worked at Bell Labs a research facility that belong to AT&T

75
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,200
During the 1920s and 30s Bell Labs was doing the research into the human voice

76
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
How to synthesize it electronically

77
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:10,112
How to compress it so it could be sent across at Norman's distances quickly and cheaply

78
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
How to encode in disguise

79
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
In all this research help AT&T basic goal which was the phone system in the United States

80
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
It was a novelty offshoot

81
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
Related to This research

82
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Merchant dispute

83
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,775
But it was closely connected to a number of Dudley's inventions at Bell labs

84
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:34,175
That still shape our world today a lot of f basic research turned out to be things

85
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
Which have impacted our modern day

86
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
Technology in the world

87
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Enormously

88
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,391
Stuff that became critical to the development of digital media for exam

89
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
On top of all of that

90
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,023
Dudley's inventions helped us win a war

91
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839
December 7th

92
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
19

93
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
41

94
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
A date which will live

95
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
In infamy

96
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
United State

97
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,591
Just a couple years after the voters debut at the World's Fair

98
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,687
Japan launched an early-morning attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii

99
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,015
It came as a profound shock to the US

100
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:15,647
And the next day President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced the country would be entering World War

101
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
With confidence

102
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
Armed Forces

103
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
Determination

104
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
People

105
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
We will game

106
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
Being knowledgeable

107
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
So help us God

108
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:38,431
World War II would be the most widespread war in history

109
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,551
The US would be fighting in Europe and the Pacific and parts of North Africa

110
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
All at the same time

111
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,695
And it was a huge challenge to coordinate troops across that much territory

112
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:55,071
It was obvious the only communication possible would be by radio

113
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,119
And that radio

114
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,679
Was of course insecure

115
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
The enemy is listening

116
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:07,615
In other words there wasn't really anything besides radio that can stretch across the distances involved

117
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
The radio is easily intercepted

118
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Answer

119
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
The

120
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,527
Problem of encryption

121
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,575
And secret messages

122
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,647
Of military importance became more and more

123
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Serious

124
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,815
At the very start of the war US military still relied on an old-school piece of

125
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Technology

126
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
Fritz sensitive Converse

127
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Crustaceans

128
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
We called the 83 scrambler

129
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,495
It works by scrambling voice frequency

130
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,311
Swapping high frequencies for low

131
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
And low frequencies for high

132
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Garbling the sound

133
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,943
Here's an example of what it might have sounded like

134
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,087
But it was easy to decode these scrambled conversations

135
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,903
Has been compromised news not secure

136
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
That's Dave Thompson

137
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,999
Choose research the history of various

138
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,071
Synthesizers and their connections to music

139
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
German intelligence

140
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,631
They're essentially

141
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
Descrambling

142
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,751
Sony's conversation is between FDR and Churchill in real time

143
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,847
And the US military the German code-breakers were listening in

144
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
VR US government

145
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,223
Cave Bell Labs the mission

146
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,527
Of creating an Unbreakable

147
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
Speech encrypter

148
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,391
And Bell Labs went to our old friend Homer Dudley

149
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,975
The guy who invented the Talking Machine of the World's Fair

150
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Dudley

151
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
Need you to figure this out

152
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Really fast

153
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
They were under

154
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:39,007
Tremendous wartime pressure to produce this thing quickly I think the whole design took about a year

155
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,079
Thankfully Dudley had already been working on

156
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
Technology-related

157
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
This problem for years

158
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
It all went back to the voter

159
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
And to another related invention of Dudley's

160
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Is called the Vogue

161
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
Music nerds might know that turned vocoder because it's the great-grandfather of the machine you here in all kinds of pop music today

162
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
Vocoder with short for voice in

163
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,863
And the Machine could break down a human voice

164
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,007
Separated into its basic components and then compress and transmit those components via short

165
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,335
You could transmit the minimum amount

166
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
Signals required

167
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,199
To reconstruct that message at the other end

168
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
This process was important

169
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:26,367
Revolutionary actually because it allowed the human voice to be digitized and compressed

170
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
Send across big distances

171
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,999
But the vocoder didn't fully disguise the boys

172
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,095
The transmission could still technically be pulled out of the air and decoded

173
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,703
To Dudley and his team had to add a layer of unbreakable encryption

174
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,543
And that's how the bolt cutter became just one small part

175
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,943
How much larger and more intricate apparatus

176
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
Military leaders in

177
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,527
Strategic locations around the world

178
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,831
The talk in total Secret

179
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,671
It was called Project X aka the greenhorn

180
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
AKA

181
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,231
Sig Sauer

182
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
Which was short for

183
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
Nothing really

184
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
It was meant to be

185
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
Confusing

186
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,447
Which Sig Sauer machine was enormous

187
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
Way more than 50

188
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Tetons

189
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:20,383
Pretty complicated Behemoth of a device device it was a room and itself

190
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,455
It occupied about 2000 square feet

191
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,503
It was made up of 40 racks

192
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
Needed

193
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
Air conditioning

194
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,695
Because a lot of the electronics was so delicately

195
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
Balanced

196
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:40,351
That if it got too hot or too cold it would not work properly

197
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,263
Infected device was full of so many finely calibrated tubes and gadgets

198
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,359
Vision of Engineers whose sole job was to maintain the machines

199
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
The 800 V

200
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
Signal Service Company

201
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:59,807
We're pretty much in charge of the installation and operation of a system

202
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,391
For he listed he was an amateur radio operator from Omaha

203
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,975
And he was one of the engineers assigned to work on Sig Sally

204
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,815
Reporting for Duty in Washington DC and spent his first two weeks

205
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
In an intensive class

206
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
Where we learned all this

207
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
The technical details

208
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,239
And the operation has pretty much on the job training

209
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,079
The first Sig Sally terminal was installed in the basement of the Pentagon

210
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,895
And it was connected to several conference rooms upstairs

211
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
Elegantly furnished

212
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,479
Apus wine-colored

213
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,783
Thick carpeting on the floor

214
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
They were beautiful rooms

215
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,647
This is Lieutenant Colonel Dorothy almada

216
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
But my nickname is Meg

217
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
Meg

218
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,047
I was in charge of the global encrypted Conference Center

219
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,887
The conference center is where dc-based military leaders would meet to

220
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
To speak over the sea

221
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
McSally cyst

222
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,519
So while I was down in the basement running the machine

223
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
Maggie's upstairs

224
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,127
Coordinating conference calls with the military brass

225
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,479
Cheetos did everyone from President Harry Truman to General George Marshall

226
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
She sat in on their meetings

227
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
And transcribe the converse

228
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:10,975
Any of the men who had the responsibility for the conduct of the war and had to make their

229
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,535
Phone calls came to my conference center

230
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
How to do it

231
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,631
Communications is the most important thing

232
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
You have to do it

233
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
With Safety and Security that

234
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
You know nobody else is

235
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
To dinner

236
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:30,687
The Sig Sally terminal in the Pentagon was connected to a network of close to a dozen other sigsaly terminals around the

237
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:37,087
These were located in the most strategically important places where politicians and military leaders would need to be talked

238
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
Working with each other on a regular basis

239
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,207
Algiers of London and Paris eventually in

240
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:47,071
Hawaii and Guam and Australia

241
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
In a row being shipped

242
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
In the Pacific

243
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,447
Beautiful strategically-important

244
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Oakland California

245
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
This network allowed leaders in Washington DC to talk securely with any location that had a terminal

246
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
All they needed was a shortwave radio connect

247
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
And one other key component

248
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
Pair of photograph records

249
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
Of totally random noise

250
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
This is where the encryption Park

251
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,511
Because for every conference that happened over 6 dali

252
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,071
Both the sending and receiving terminals

253
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
Had to have identical record

254
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,167
Which played the sound of noise

255
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:30,335
The noise would combine with the boys components as they were transmitted via shortwave radio making it impossible

256
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
Dropper to decrypt

257
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,711
On the receiving end the random noise will be extracted in the voice restored

258
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,807
In cryptography these records are what's known as a one-time key

259
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
So here's how they work

260
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,159
Random noise would be generated

261
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,231
And then pressed on a gold master

262
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,815
Normally a phonograph record you would reproduce

263
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
Thousands of them

264
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,959
From a single master in this case they made exactly to record

265
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,823
Be identical and now totally unique records would be assigned a matching code name

266
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,383
Annies code names were awesome

267
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
Like red strawberry

268
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
Wild dog

269
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
Circus clown

270
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,903
So what's a President Harry Truman in Washington DC wants to talk with prime minister Winston Churchill in London

271
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,743
Truman keeps one of the two records in Washington DC

272
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
The second one

273
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Would be sent

274
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,911
To the station at the other side of the ocean

275
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
And then placed on this special Precision turntable that was a part of the

276
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
Fisichelli terminal

277
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:40,991
At the scheduled time for the conference sigsaly engineers in DC and London would tune in to WWE

278
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:47,135
12 minutes

279
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
Which is the

280
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,975
International time control station

281
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,559
So that we can synchronize our control clocks

282
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
Exactly

283
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,887
Then they get their identical records

284
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
Spending on their respective turntables

285
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
At exactly the same moment

286
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
Once the records were synced

287
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,383
Truman would speak into a handset in Meigs conference room at the Pentagon

288
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,663
This is the president

289
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Mr. prime minister

290
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,271
This is a reenactment of Truman and Churchill greeting each other

291
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,111
When they talked to be at 6 Sally to discuss a German surrender Pro

292
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
Proposal in 19

293
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:25,023
The signal would go down into the basement or Don was running the Sig Sally terminal

294
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,887
The terminal with digitized Raymond voice mix it with random noise from the record

295
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,727
And then transmit that signal across the ocean via shortwave radio

296
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,383
On the other end the 6th alley terminal in London would reverse the process

297
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
It would remove the noise

298
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
Reconstruct the boys

299
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
Beat it through Churchill pants

300
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,391
After so much processing and such a long distance

301
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
The boys didn't sound very good

302
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
Like gibberish

303
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,023
Orated from the bottom of a

304
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Barrel

305
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
But it wasn't Elitch

306
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
You had a kind of train your ear abish

307
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Anyway

308
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,495
Then Churchill would reply

309
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
And the whole process

310
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:24,159
In this way Truman and Churchill could have a completely secure real-time Converse

311
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Crustacean

312
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
Planning plotting

313
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Strategizing

314
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
When the conversation ended

315
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
The two records

316
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Remember

317
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
Are contained the top-secret random noise

318
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Key

319
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Would be

320
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,871
That's because if anyone was recording this communication as it traveled over the ocean the random noise record would be the key

321
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
Key to the Kryptonite

322
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:51,295
It would allow them to subtract the noise in the same way that 6 lb Engineers did at each end of the transmission

323
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,159
So the records were the most classified and sensitive component of success Ali

324
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,207
By the end of world war

325
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,791
2 there had been a total of about 3

326
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Thousand

327
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,119
Top secret strategic conferences

328
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,447
In other words at least 6000 vinyl record

329
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
That were pressed

330
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Delivered

331
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,055
Used and then destroyed at the end of the

332
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,663
DeBary today or if they run a memory type technology but

333
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
By that time it was

334
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,503
Even thought of

335
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,575
Voice Communications in terms of being digitized

336
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:30,975
And because of my voice

337
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
So if

338
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,559
People were listening in

339
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,375
To that signal if Germans were listening in

340
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
What would they hear

341
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,495
Nothing but random noise just

342
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
Total white noise

343
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:51,711
I mean it might have been so unintelligible that they didn't even realize they were listening to anything at all

344
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Never

345
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
New of the existence of the system

346
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,343
And they never had any inkling

347
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
That it was an encrypted

348
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Speech

349
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:06,303
Exactly that's why I said Sally was nicknamed The Green Hornet after the popular 1940's radio show

350
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:13,215
Because an intercepted Sig Sally transmission sounded like nothing more than a hornet's but

351
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,895
Sig Sauer was involved in pretty much every major military operation after 1942

352
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:26,271
It was even critical in the planning of the Manhattan Project in the dropping of the atomic bombs over Japan

353
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:31,135
Scripting and listen in on those six conversations

354
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,743
Even though he didn't know at the time the meaning of the code words they were using

355
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,327
And I'm assuming that she is coming over in the Titleist Manhattan Project

356
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,911
But I question know what the Manhattan Project was

357
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
John didn't reflect mod

358
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,543
John the grave implications of those meetings he overheard

359
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
He was an engineer

360
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
Doing his best

361
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Keep the equipment running

362
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:58,271
You didn't pay that much attention to everything that was said you're more concerned with the transmission

363
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:02,879
But he knows it would have been hard for the Allies to win the war without Sig Sally

364
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,439
It's hard to say what we would do if we didn't have it

365
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,279
Even if that Victory sometimes came at a brutal price

366
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,935
At the end of the war the six Sally terminals were dumped in the ocean

367
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Almost

368
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,519
Every encryption device

369
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,615
Was intentionally destroyed when the war was over

370
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,455
Security purposes to the extent of destroying

371
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
The plan

372
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,135
But not before the military develop successors that were smaller and simpler and easier to set up

373
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,743
These new devices still work in the same principles of encryption as Sig Sally

374
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,095
And there were used for secure Communications during the Cold War the Korean War

375
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,399
Negotiate the Cuban Missile Crisis

376
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,287
A lot of the information related to Sig Sally wasn't the classified until the mid 1970

377
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,127
When AT&T sue the US military under the freedom of

378
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
Information

379
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,687
Once it was public

380
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
Technology that originated with Sig Sally

381
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,551
When on two entirely new realm

382
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:08,671
The vocoder for instance went on to have a whole new life in music

383
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:15,071
In the 1970s electronic musicians like Kraftwerk began using a smaller version of the machine to cry

384
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,375
Create weird robotic vocal effects

385
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,751
From Germany the vocoder spread to the Bronx

386
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
In Brooklyn

387
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,847
Where hip hop and Electro Funk group started playing around with

388
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
Now you hear it all over the

389
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,767
But the vocoders reach actually goes Way Beyond

390
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
The robot voice

391
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,655
You're also using vocoder every time

392
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
You use your mobile phone

393
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,263
But of course in a much much reduce size

394
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,567
The giant clunky machine of the past

395
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,639
Now occupies the space of a tiny chip

396
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:06,527
Impressive speech and allowed hundreds of conversations to pass through a single cell phone tower

397
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,879
And a lot of the technology used to transmit media on the internet

398
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
Can be traced back to Dudley to

399
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,255
That includes MP3 music

400
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:22,655
That includes video compression give thanks to Homer Dudley every time you watch something on the

401
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
The internet

402
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,263
All those millions of viral videos would take up too much space

403
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
Can you decompress

404
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
Jollibee

Everything

407
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,671
In our modern Digital World of media

408
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463
Can they trace back

409
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999

And Meg Mattson

416
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,503
The vocoder enlisted

417
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
It did it survey
