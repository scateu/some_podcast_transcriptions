1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
This is 99% invisible

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,328
I'm Roman Mars

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,936
Andrew Weiland has always loved to read

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:13,824
5th grader with the kid who sat on a utility box during recess reading The Hobbit while everyone else

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,848
Play kickball

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
In Middle School

7
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,688
To learn the trade names of the book imprints

8
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,528
That published the druggie contemporary fiction that he was starting to get into

9
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,576
And in 2003

10
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
You dropped out of college

11
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,928
I moved to San Francisco to work for his favorite publisher

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
Mcsweeney's

13
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,256
It was my dream job

14
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,560
And working there exacerbated my already in

15
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,584
Spanish for pretty

16
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,608
Matthew Henry

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,264
I got to live out my fantasy of being an ink-stained wretch even if that meant logging 12-hour days an in-class computer

18
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,592
I edited essays and interviews played out articles

19
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,664
It's a weird amount of pleasure and typographical minutiae

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
Like italicize in Camas

21
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,760
And rewriting headlines so they fit the frame just so

22
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,600
Havoc Sweeney's books and magazines whenever just containers forward

23
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,136
They were works of art

24
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,464
And I was trying to take as much care with the look

25
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,488
Can feel if the print

26
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,256
As I did with you

27
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,280
Expression of the idea

28
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,632
But as much as Andrew love to print Pizza love

29
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:15,776
He also has a condition that will eventually change his relationship to it pretty radically

30
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,080
I'm going blind

31
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,616
Really really slowly

32
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,432
Right now it's like I've got a foot in both world

33
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,712
Blind and sighted

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,504
I have a degenerative retina

35
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
It's giving me severe tunnel vision

36
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,344
So basically no peripheral vision

37
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,160
It's like I'm peering at the world through a toilet paper

38
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,976
When it gets a little narrower every few months

39
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
10

40
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm going to try to read this

41
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,656
See if I got it right

42
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216
Can

43
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
We

44
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:52,384
My retinal specialist told me that I probably don't need to worry about losing the ability to read

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
For another five years or so

46
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,760
But I've already started using a special digital program to learn Braille

47
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Which is not easy

48
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
B cockle

49
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,392
What I want to get a jumpstart in before I actually

50
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
Free

51
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
Rick Astley

52
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
What

53
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
A recycle

54
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,264
Can we recycle a metal can

55
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,640
I know I'll still be able to experience books for the rest of my life

56
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,200
I'm lucky to be going blind in the digital age

57
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,600
And the Golden Age of audio there's an abundance of well-produced audiobooks and technology that can read aloud

58
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,904
Almost anything that appears on a screen

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
Puzzles

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,328
Chinese can ride a unicycle or two puzzles

61
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:48,192
My niece can ride a unicycle or do puzzles

62
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,544
Does that mean my niece

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,944
Can do no such thing despite all that there's still some mellow tragedy

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,784
Any idea that in a few years I'll probably no longer be able to read print

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,928
After a life spent loving books there's now a real urgency for me in the question of how blind people experience literal

66
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:14,560
I find myself deeply curious about what graphic design might mean to someone who can't see

67
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,888
So I started looking into the history of reading Technologies for the blind

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,472
Traditionally books are visual objects

69
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,872
And for centuries now blind and sighted designers have been arguing over the most effective way to translate

70
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
Habitual ink print book

71
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,992
Into an accessible form for people with outside

72
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
Pres long as blind people have been reading there's been this tension between systems that try to stay close to the

73
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
Original form of a book

74
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,976
And systems that dramatically depart

75
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,792
Tomorrow ideas of what a book can be

76
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
Designers have made incredible breakthroughs to create non visual forms of reading for blind people

77
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,336
Find critic pointed out the designers have a bad habit of quote talking to the fingers in the language of the eyes

78
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,736
So the history of blind reading is really the history of finding a new language for the fingers and for the ear

79
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,344
One that captures the Essential Elements of the ink print book but

80
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
In a new language

81
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
That's Unbound from the visual

82
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
And that history centers around two main shapes

83
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
Lines

84
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
And.

85
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,983
Our story starts in 18th century Europe before Braille was invented before blind people were even taught

86
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
To read at all

87
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,311
First off no one thinks that it's possible

88
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,335
Formica

89
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
Kids II

90
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
Learn that's my cuts

91
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,759
The museum director at the American printing house for the blind in Louisville Kentucky

92
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
And if they could

93
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
No one knows how to do

94
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
Without access to education

95
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
Blind people were overwhelmingly poor

96
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
And employment prospects were dim

97
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,279
If their families had enough money and time to support them

98
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,375
They usually lived at home like adult children sitting idly around the house

99
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
Many others were forced to beg on the street

100
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,031
Dora handful of institutions in Europe to support the poorest cases

101
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
What a Pity the blind

102
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Hid them away

103
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
Within this guy named Valentino he comes along

104
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,503
Are we was born into a family of Weaver's in France

105
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
Yes and he was a skilled linguist

106
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,879
He was first inspired to help the blind in 1771

107
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
We saw a group of blind people being mocked

108
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Potable in Paris

109
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
They have been given dunce cap

110
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
And giant fake glasses

111
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
And they were made

112
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,655
Play musical instruments and pretend to read book

113
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,727
So are we founded the first known School for the Blind

114
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,519
It was called The Royal Institute

115
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
In Paris

116
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
But even as he's getting the school going

117
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,871
How we kept aside

118
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
And I wheeze

119
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
Sidegig

120
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
Is as a translator

121
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,599
And so every now and then go get these fancy

122
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Embossed

123
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,159
Invitations Denver

124
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
And one day

125
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
What about we students

126
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
A kid named Francois Le Sueur

127
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Touchpoint

128
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
And Francois Le Sueur notices

129
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Is that he can

130
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
Feel something on these put on these invitations

131
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
And that gives a weedy idea the idea to develop this idea of embossed printing

132
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
Erased letters so in 1786 how he makes the first machine in Boston

133
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Books for the blind

134
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Treatise

135
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
Unblind education

136
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
It's written in print

137
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,159
The kind that sighted readers would recognize

138
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
Text is all raised so that blind students can

139
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,791
Fuel the shape of letters

140
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,327
It's a radical move

141
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,143
Matches the first book for blind readers in history

142
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
Basically the beginning

143
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
The idea that blind people can be educate

144
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
But there are a few problem

145
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
Well

146
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
First off no one can afford to buy the

147
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Okay

148
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,711
That's because the books are messy

149
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,503
And prohibitively expensive

150
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
But they're also just really hard to read

151
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,647
They're filled with ornate 18th century letter form

152
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,487
With their curlicues and flourishes which are confusing to the fingertip

153
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
It's not until many years later

154
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,351
Near the end of Ali's life in 1821

155
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,911
Are very different blind reading system begins to

156
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Develop

157
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
When that uses dots instead of lines

158
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,127
It starts when a captain from Napoleon's Army visit the school to share a system that he developed for French soldiers

159
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,759
The captain describes how the system allowed his men to silently communicate with each other on battlefields at night

160
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
This is a clip from a very Lively educational movie about the

161
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Melee

162
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
I called it

163
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,471
The director of the school at the time let a group of students

164
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,007
Experiment with the emboss

165
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,311
Pages that the captain had left behind

166
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
And in that group

167
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,639
Was a 12 year old blind cat

168
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
Name the Louis Braille

169
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,503
Over the next few years he began to adapt that military code

170
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Beurre blanc

171
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,831
Asthma alternative to raised print

172
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
Can't you take a break

173
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
No

174
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,607
I got it so that all the letters of the alphabet

175
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,655
Are represented by race.

176
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
Indifferent

177
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,799
Louis Braille simplified the military code in maximize its efficiency

178
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,383
Keep substituted D12. System developed by the captain

179
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
Into a 6. System

180
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,015
Which allows blind people to read faster by recognizing a letter

181
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
With a touch of a single finger

182
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
And while this code was inscrutable decided

183
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
It was a system that blind people need it

184
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,047
Designed by a blind person who understood intimately the needs of those reading by touch

185
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,375
Another advocate for the blind would say of Braille

186
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
It Bears the stamp of Genius

187
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
Like the Roman alphabet itself

188
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
But despite its effectiveness

189
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,567
Braille didn't catch on right away

190
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,383
It wouldn't become the dominant system in France

191
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
For another 30 years

192
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:55,039
It'll be nearly a century before it became standard for blind readers in the US

193
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
Because it was effectively suppress

194
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,159
My well-intentioned world famous visionary

195
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
Education

196
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,815
Around the same time that Braille was quietly developing his new readings

197
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
An American named Samuel Gridley Howe

198
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
Came to visit the Royal insta

199
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,495
He was doing research in anticipation of opening the

200
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
First School for the Blind in the US

201
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,895
And I wish I could tell you that well in France how discovered the wonders of Braille

202
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
But that's not how it went down

203
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,783
Instead he saw the raised letter books and he was intrigued

204
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
But in true American fashion

205
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,415
He found all their fancy flourishes impractical

206
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,719
And typical of European Xs

207
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,071
So we decided to make his own system that improved on the Europeans were

208
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:45,471
And he came back and he he modified it a bit

209
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,311
Which how established in Massachusetts in 1829

210
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
Because they were using a more

211
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,407
Gothic style font that

212
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
He felt was

213
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
Was a little

214
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,783
Two ornamental and more difficult to read

215
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
By touch

216
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,159
So fun about ways French books look sort of like an ancient tome in a horror movie

217
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,975
Whose letters rise up in fleshy protuberance

218
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,279
And how system is similar

219
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
But it looks more runic

220
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Kokanee

221
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Elvish

222
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,655
How sharpen his letters curves into

223
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
Points to make them more distinct under the finger

224
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
Alero for example

225
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
Is shaped like a diamond

226
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,079
How cold is new system

227
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
Boston line type

228
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,431
Boston line type is is really the beginning of

229
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,527
Literacy as we know it as a movement for

230
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
People who are blind

231
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
In the United States

232
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:39,487
And like the older French system Boston linetype was designed to be read both by blind and sighted

233
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,815
If you're able to see and look at one of these books

234
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
The letters are

235
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
Totally easily

236
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
Legible

237
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,727
Boston line type allows blind people and sighted people

238
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,079
To sit down together and to read there's no barrier between them

239
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
And this idea was really important to how

240
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
She didn't want my people to use a system

241
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,015
Mike Brown it was separate from what side of the Equator

242
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,879
Starwood isolate blind people and prevent them from integrating into the wider world

243
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,463
Long before the concept of Universal Design has been articulated

244
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,047
It was informing house thinking about how to design for people with disabilities

245
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
I know so you can imagine

246
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,143
The arch well we want our

247
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
Kids that are blind

248
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
Compared to use the same system that are cited

249
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Right.

250
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,799
Sounds good right

251
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
But it turns out that

252
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
Racers are just not as good

253
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
So it's harder

254
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,783
It just is harder it's that's not intuitive to people who recited

255
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,391
Those letterforms are just not unique enough

256
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
From each other

257
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
Siding people look

258
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
Kane Brown

259
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:49,119
But under the finger those raised dots underneath your finger are just more Tanger

260
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
Kayla just

261
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
And not only that

262
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
You can write in Braille

263
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,359
Print it doesn't require a big heavy metal printing press

264
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,199
All you need is a small simple tool called a slate and stylus

265
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
That fits in your pocket

266
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
By the 1860s

267
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,599
Some schools of the blind in the US

268
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,903
Had begun experimenting with Braille

269
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:16,511
And while many faculty members still resisted it as an arbitrary in pension

270
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
Bose system

271
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
The blind students who were exposed to Braille

272
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,911
Argued passionately for its superiority to raise letters

273
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:28,799
The Missouri School for the Blind students passed each other notes and reportedly even love letters in Braille

274
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:32,127
Since they knew their teachers wouldn't be able to read them if they got caught

275
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:38,527
But how had invested a massive amount of time and resources into developing Distributing and promoting Basta

276
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Inline type

277
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,647
He become a hugely influential celebrity in the field of blind education

278
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
He was a master fundraiser

279
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,815
And key to that fundraising apparatus was the spectacle of a deaf blind girl named Laura Bridgman

280
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,351
To have taught to read

281
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
Using Boston line time

282
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,727
Bridgeman was the first deaf blind person in history to get in education

283
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,799
More than a full generation before Helen Keller did

284
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,127
This achievement made Laura Bridgman and Howe

285
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
International Star

286
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,479
Which Hal leverage to make Boston linetype

287
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,575
One of the dominant print mediums for the blind across the US

288
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Like how

289
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,183
Many of the directors and faculty of schools for the blind were cited

290
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
And many of them believe that they knew which sister

291
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
The most best

292
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,071
Well it's easy for me reading a print letter so

293
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,375
How do you say for them with their fingers she now in

294
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:30,239
I think it's a failure of imagination or failure of empathy or

295
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
A failure of

296
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Experience

297
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,175
Catherine kudlak directs the Paul K Longmore Institute on disability at San Francisco State where she's also a history

298
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
She doesn't even really buy house argue

299
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
Boston line type is universal

300
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,087
You might as well is universal but it's

301
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
Universal in that way that the colonizer

302
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,951
Thanks things are Universal it's like

303
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,303
You know these poor native peoples need educating and will try to bring them up

304
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
To my level and make them like

305
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
Like me

306
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
Didn't get the blind

307
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
People to be there

308
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,959
Is a crucial part

309
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,263
Disability Rights

310
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Refrain is nothing

311
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Us without us

312
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
Yeah

313
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
People are starting to say it is nothing without us

314
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
.

315
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,623
I think how probably made a good-faith effort to create a universal system

316
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
One that predicted Universal Design

317
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,255
When did he hoped would erase the line dividing a blind from the side

318
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
Paradoxically

319
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,887
The committing so strongly to the universal page of Boston line time

320
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,007
How help delay the adoption of a much better system by close to a hundred years in the US

321
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
Assistant with a blind person

322
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,847
Louis Braille was the expert

323
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,919
But the early Twentieth Century how had died

324
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:47,807
They were growing numbers organization dedicated to serving the Blind and more and more of them

325
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
We're being led

326
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Vibeline

327
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,903
In 1921

328
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
Leaders from the most influential of these groups

329
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
Gathered in rural Iowa

330
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,327
Deformed the American foundation for the blind

331
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,447
Bafb quickly became the most powerful blindness organization in the US

332
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,239
One of their first priorities

333
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
The dominant system

334
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
But Americans being Americans

335
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
The same thing happened at it happen with raised letters

336
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
We decided that we could design things

337
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
Is better than those pretentious Europeans could

338
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
Soho cottage industry a rose

339
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,599
With all sorts of competing system

340
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
Real knock off

341
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
So

342
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,743
Now we're heading into what we call the war of the.

343
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
Have you heard of that

344
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:34,655
We could spend an entire episode on the war of the dots with Mike Hutson Hazard trusting narrator but in a nutshell

345
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,215
Before Braille truly one out in the US

346
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,055
There was another 50 years of competing tactile systems

347
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,615
This. Drove many blind readers banana

348
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,967
Because every library for the blind was filled with book printed in these multiple

349
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Sam keating sister

350
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
New York point

351
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Moon type

352
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,599
American modified Braille

353
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
We're not going to go in

354
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
But at one point

355
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Ahead of the

356
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Perkins School

357
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
Abscess

358
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
You know

359
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
Convince another code for

360
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
The blind we want to shoot

361
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,959
The decisive battle in the war of the dots

362
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
Finally came in 1909

363
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,103
Cities like New York or rapidly growing and for the first time

364
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,455
They had enough blind children to start building day schools for the blind

365
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
And so they have a nice

366
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,319
Big 2-day knock-down

367
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,391
Drag out meeting of the New York Board of Education

368
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
To decide which

369
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Code

370
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
They're going to you

371
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
In New York City

372
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
So they bring in

373
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,327
All the heavy hitter

374
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,423
Okay I mean everybody's anybody in blindness testifies

375
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
Spotty

376
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,239
And at the end I take a big

377
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
Can they vote

378
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
For break

379
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Okay

380
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,663
It's the beginning of the end for the up competing code

381
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
My 1917

382
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,343
The rest of the country follows New York's lead in the newly standardized English Braille

383
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,671
Becomes the main way Plum children are taught to read in the US

384
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,999
And with their increasing self-determination and literacy

385
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:08,095
Blind people are more able to integrate into society than ever before

386
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,167
Blind children are starting to be mainstreamed into public schools

387
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
First time

388
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,591
Some blind people are getting office jobs using Tech like Braille typewriter so they can work alongside cited

389
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
As equals

390
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
It's what how had hoped

391
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Boston

392
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
Type without looking

393
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,039
Before all rails advantages over raised print

394
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
It didn't work for all blind

395
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,927
Like the thousands of soldiers who are coming back from war with eye injury

396
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Two hands

397
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
Umbrellas kids

398
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:40,607
As you probably noticed listening to me struggle to read that stupid sentence about my niece doing puzzle

399
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Puzzles

400
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,007
My niece can ride a unicycle or tooth puzzle

401
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,055
Learning braille as an adult

402
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
Is really hard

403
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,895
My niece can ride a unicycle

404
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
Urdu puzzles

405
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,039
But it sound recording became easier and more affordable

406
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,111
Those people who become blind later in life

407
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
Add new option

408
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,975
Options that would transform our ideas of what a book

409
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Canby

410
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:14,655
Translating ink print books into sound might seem more straightforward than building a tactile reading system

411
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,495
Deborah books were born out of a few thousand years of people telling each other stories

412
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,311
We all learn to read by having books read to us

413
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,895
The early efforts to make recordings of books for blind readers

414
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,919
Brought with them

415
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
A new set of design challenge

416
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,807
American foundation for the blind partnered with the Carnegie Corporation

417
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
And to publish experimental books

418
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
Sun phonographic Records

419
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
They called them

420
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671
Talking books

421
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,511
They hired narrators and press the recordings on too long playing record

422
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
25 minutes

423
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,303
To sign

424
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:47,935
These books were circulated by blind people about a decade before LPS became available to The Wider public

425
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
The first audio books

426
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
And the first LPS

427
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
Were made for blind reader

428
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,103
But these talking books raised

429
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Big question

430
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
What should a book

431
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Sound like

432
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,503
How do you translate the elements of a codex

433
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,319
Which is a fancy word for the thing that we usually call a book

434
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
Book with paper pages in combining

435
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,415
How do you translate one of those things

436
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
Into sound

437
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,999
The definition of the book basically

438
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,303
Imploded

439
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,143
Right after these talking book started to be developed because

440
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
All sorts of producers a started to come up with new ideas for things that they would call talking books that certainly had

441
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Had nothing to do with

442
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
The Codex form

443
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:31,199
She's professor at NYU who works at the intersection of media and disabilities

444
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,247
And I promise you the last academic

445
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
Can introduce you to

446
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,623
Sexy Dodge Charger for a minute and listen to his bringing Cathedral like song

447
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
The Cornell Ornithology lab for instance

448
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
Decided that they wanted

449
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,351
To take some of their bird song recordings and make a talking book for blind people out of them

450
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
Bank of America

451
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:57,311
When Snow White came out as an early animated talking movie

452
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,663
The AFP decided they wanted to make a talking book version of a talking movie

453
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,199
Walt Disney's

454
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,015
Snowflake and the Seven Dwarfs

455
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,575
Recorded solely for the Youth

456
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Sublime

457
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
There was no book

458
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
Origin they called it book

459
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
Panda circulated as

460
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
Talking book but it was a

461
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
Audio description

462
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,839
Of the images

463
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,959
In an animated film with some of the sound files and dialogue from that film

464
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,775
Closer and closer

465
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,479
Big night then Snow White notices

466
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,343
Very quickly all sorts of things begin to be called books

467
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,183
It had a very marginal relationship to the book

468
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
Book form

469
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,279
And it's talking books became more elaborate and Theatrical

470
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,583
Warfield with sound effects and music

471
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,143
Some blind people grew frustrated

472
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:59,519
More and more blind readers wound up breaking their record players trying to speed up the voices of the narrator

473
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,823
They weren't listening for Sonic aesthetic

474
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
Pleasure they wanted the damn information

475
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:07,199
And the fancy Productions move too slowly for how fast they wanted

476
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:13,855
What's the thing that posed to make people listen to podcasts at Double speed as with raised letter books the ornamental flourishes of music and

477
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,928
Sound effects got in the way of blind people's desire for Speed

478
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
And so talking books began to sound

479
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
The Holy Bible

480
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
Read by Alexander Scourby

481
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
No-nonsense narrator

482
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
Alexander Scourby

483
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,008
Became more popular in the 1940s and 50

484
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,824
And their voices became almost like fonts

485
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
Standardized

486
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Legible

487
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
And most importantly

488
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,456
Conveying information without getting in the way

489
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,504
More like the narrator's of Contemporary Art

490
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
What about 4

491
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Darkness

492
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
The spirit of God moved

493
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
The face of the waters

494
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
God said

495
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
Let there be light

496
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
And there was light

497
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,664
The book historian Matthew Berry told me that if you bring up the name Alexander Scourby with a blind person of a certain age

498
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
Their eyes will fill with tears

499
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,504
Because of the associations they have

500
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
With his voice

501
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,064
They grew up listening to him

502
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Reading

503
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,672
So perhaps this is my constellation is it become a blind reader

504
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
I can just trade a visual type

505
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
Bass Reverb

506
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:35,008
In some ways my fears about losing my visual relationship to books resembles the anxieties that sighted people have a

507
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:41,408
About the demise of print in the digital age has more and more people read on screens there's an old guard who bemoans these new

508
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
Forms of reading as inferior

509
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,016
These critics believe that the trustee old technology of the book

510
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,576
Will always be the superior vehicle for ideas

511
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:55,232
You can hear this conservatism and condescension not only in those people who Milani book

512
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:59,072
But also in the voices of people who say that you haven't really read a book

513
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:03,936
If you listen to it they contended that real reading only happens with the eyes

514
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,544
The history of blindness and reading shows that the way we read has always been in

515
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,408
The media scholars in book historians I talk to all told me the same thing

516
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,736
Reading doesn't happen in the eyes or the ears of the fingers

517
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
It happens in the brain

518
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,088
This is a nice thing to hear if you're going blind

519
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
It makes me feel like

520
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
Forget my stupid eyes

521
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184
I'll still have my brain

522
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
That's where all the good stuff happens anyway

523
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,560
But this idea doesn't really soften or mask

524
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,096
The fact of blindness is

525
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
Inescapably

526
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
Leah loss

527
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,728
No amount of historical research or conceptual reframing can hide

528
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,008
Simple equation at work

529
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
I love books

530
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
April books

531
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,384
With marginalia and typefaces and dingbats

532
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,432
I'm going blind will take that away from

533
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
But I can't let that be my only kin

534
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
Conclusion

535
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
The blindness equals loss

536
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
.

537
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,136
Mara Mills told me about someone she met

538
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,976
The story could offer me an example of a different way to approach my life as

539
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
Is a blind reader

540
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
His name is Harvey Lauer

541
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,096
He's a blind guy who worked at the VA

542
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
Testing all kinds of Technology

543
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
For the visually impaired

544
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
When you turn on the machine

545
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
You here

546
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
All the sounds in the ear

547
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,920
This is Harvey using an optophone

548
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
Kind of scanner

549
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:23,552
That would look at text and turn it into a series of tones representing the shapes

550
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
Cast of the letters

551
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,648
It's another spin on Universal Design for blind readers

552
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
With an optophone

553
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,488
You wouldn't need to create special books

554
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
For the blind at all

555
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:36,352
But training a blind person could read an ink print book

556
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,144
Using one of these devices

557
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,216
Delta phone was first developed in 1912

558
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,496
But this recording

559
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
Is from 1971

560
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
Reading sounds like this

561
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
First off the line

562
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
And then we'll read

563
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
Incredibly

564
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,392
Some people actually learned how to read

565
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,512
After a lot of practice they can hear the sounds and decode the words they represent it

566
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,096
Reading entire novels using what came to be called musical print

567
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:15,776
It said the necessary functions of the

568
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,128
Using the devices he tested for the VA

569
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
Harvey could read by vibration

570
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,200
True musical Prince

571
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
Plus Braille and super speed up talk

572
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,016
Bucks

573
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,064
He reads using more of his body

574
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,088
Worth his senses

575
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
Perhaps anyone else on the planet

576
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,184
His colleagues called him a cyborg

577
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:37,024
She walked around with these devices dangling around his neck wherever he went

578
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,328
Emitting vibrations in synthetic Musical

579
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,400
Got to go to the I had a turn up the trash or after

580
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,424
Empirical

581
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,312
Bar told me that this sometimes lead to funny incidents of confusion

582
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:54,688
Like the time Harvey walked into a 7-Eleven and heard all these electronic tones coming out of the various machines in the

583
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
Play Store

584
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
He tried to coating them

585
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,040
Because it seemed to him like they should be alphabetic

586
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
And then he realized

587
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Nope

588
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
There's just electronic tones

589
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:13,120
Harvey's mistake in the 7-Eleven suggest to me away that my future as a blind reader might actually signal something

590
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
Other than a total loss

591
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
Linus could add something to my life

592
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,752
Even if it takes something else away

593
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,800
Learning to read in new ways

594
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,080
Through new senses

595
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,616
Could increase my appreciation

596
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
In for the world around me

597
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:31,040
Harvey told Mara that he finds the electronic tones and chords of the optifoam beautiful

598
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,856
He said they remind him of Debussy music

599
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
Which gives me hope

600
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,952
That whichever way I end up reading

601
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,024
To spit up synthetic speech for Braille

602
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,424
Or maybe some high-tech post-op to phonics cyborg system that's yet to be invented that I'll find the beauty in that kind of

603
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
2

604
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:59,712
I really should use the other earphones and plug in the other speaker

605
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,184
Hypothesis are

606
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,584
Replace it with a more adequate one

607
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:20,704
Failure to find

608
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,832
Does not miss sellers

609
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,104
Give me the park composer Sean real

610
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,504
Al gives us a short lesson in Reading with the up the phone and break down the music they can pose for this episode using OptiFine

611
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Phonic letters

612
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:12,928
After this

613
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,496
So I'm now in the studio with Sean real so the song at the very end

614
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
The story was a

615
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,592
Special song that related to the episode

616
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,152
So you can you describe I like how you made the music

617
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
Traductor

618
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
Piccolo section of the episode

619
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,016
Yeah so when we were doing our edit

620
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
Like

621
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
Everyone was just like

622
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,392
So fascinated

623
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:49,792
By the optophone at the end of the story and throughout that whole section everyone was just going

624
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
Like the sort of sounds of it we're just

625
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,400
Prancing and so

626
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,984
I had I was just like taking with howling music low as and I was

627
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,776
Like this would be really cool thing to use this

628
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:03,104
An instrument and so then I asked Andrew

629
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
Buddhist Peace FM

630
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,200
There was a way to get samples of

631
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,736
The alphabet basic

632
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
Not only like make

633
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
Music out of

634
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,904
The sounds but liked actually like spell something out in like make

635
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
IMessage

636
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,232
Have been lyrics to the song

637
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,352
I found out that it's very hard to actually write with with

638
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,632
Optophone

639
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:29,216
Samples but I'll talk a little bit more about that later

640
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,032
I want to play you some of this because

641
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,080
When I was listening to

642
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,128
The tape of like all these different letters

643
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,200
I was really struck actually with how intuitive it is

644
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
Cool

645
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,504
Okay what's your sign

646
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,808
First thing I'm going to do is going to play you a no

647
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
So here's a no

648
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,928
What the other phone is doing it's actually scanning tags

649
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
And so it's

650
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
Basically making an auditory

651
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:58,400
Shape of the letter so the O meaning of like the left of the oh you're going to have kind of like

652
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:03,776
To Midtown like very close to the middle and then as the circle opens up

653
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
You're going to have a tone

654
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
That is high on a tone that is low

655
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,944
And then they're going to close back up back up okay so yeah

656
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
Teutones the middle

657
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
And then

658
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,088
Expanse high and low and then goes back down to

659
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,368
To be in the middle in that crate

660
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
It's the shape of a now so weird

661
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
Skating across

662
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
What's a letter

663
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,232
As if it's just printed

664
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,840
Yeah I'm so here's here's that same oh again but slow down so you can really hear it

665
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Okay

666
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,176
Another letter that I thought was the best letter x

667
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Actually

668
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,040
Is is a w in Philly this one I think you'll really be able to hear this

669
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Because

670
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,648
Unlike the or actually most of the letters in the alphabet

671
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,952
VW doesn't have any like

672
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,024
Vertical stacking so it's really just like

673
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,328
It really you really do like read it

674
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
Left to right

675
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:06,496
Like at a time so like you don't hear two tone simultaneously so you should be able to trace

676
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,056
The W as it goes high low

677
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
Hi-Lo

678
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
Exactly

679
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
So here's the w

680
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:20,064
Then here it is

681
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,696
Do that again

682
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:31,328
Yeah but I really love is that like

683
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,168
You can tell that the midpoint of the W is lower than the other

684
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:42,080
Turn the outside right and so they're choosing a certain type of w it doesn't go all the way it is Anna.

685
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:47,200
W with a middle goes all the way to the Top Line and then which one what goes in the middle

686
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,760
It's extremely specific to whatever

687
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,600
Whatever font you have whatever page your reading make sense

688
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,672
Southern making music I was listening to

689
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,720
A lot of rods have of

690
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,000
Harvey Lauer just

691
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,816
Playing with his optophone and kind of like

692
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,120
Being awed at

693
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:11,520
It in the same way that we were in so that was and so that was just like so need and so there's there's like

694
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
This type of him

695
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Just

696
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Reading numbers

697
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,664
I'm just like really getting a kick out of it

698
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,552
There's an open for by golly

699
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
Music

700
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,136
Define

701
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,184
These are nice numbers

702
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,216
He developed the other phone so like

703
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:47,616
He's probably the person most fluent in optophone he's in the world but like you said like this is us

704
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,152
Scanner that goes across

705
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:53,248
Any print that there is so it's like he's reading

706
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
Ascertain

707
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,880
Display qunar sometimes you know like I make a 7 with a crosshatch

708
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,904
Example

709
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,184
And so that would

710
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,000
Sound different than a normal 7 without a cross

711
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
Across the middle of

712
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
But yeah so even though

713
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
You know he knows

714
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
The optimum better than anybody

715
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,960
Everytime it scans a new

716
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
Font typeface

717
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,408
Get something new something new from that is all really enjoying reading okay that's so great

718
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
Yeah

719
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,224
So inspired by the APA

720
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
The phone you compose

721
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:30,112
A couple of songs and one of them was at the end and it had a message inside of it

722
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
That was a

723
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,416
A true optophone message

724
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
Inside of the song so what did it say

725
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,048
Very true about the phone message and said OptiFine

726
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:44,448
That's great cuz I always what you can kind of figure out and see

727
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:48,800
Stuff like that simple yet and that's and that's exactly like leading to my next Point like

728
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:54,944
I tried out a lot of like different messages cuz I originally thought like who I could like have like a hole

729
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,992
Sentence or something but

730
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,040
I noticed that

731
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,088
Because these sounds are coming just
