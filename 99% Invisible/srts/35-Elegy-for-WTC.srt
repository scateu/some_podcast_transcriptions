This is 99% invisible

18
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,496
I want to be careful not to overstate what it means for a building to die

19
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,688
The building's worth is an infant a small fraction of the worth of a person's life

20
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:00,576
Even two buildings don't even move the needle comparison to real human laws

21
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,232
The building is still a living thing anyway

22
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Breathe

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
And it moves

24
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,936
This movement makes a cent

25
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
The structural engineer who

26
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,896
Design the World Trade Center towers

27
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,200
Cuz of the people working inside

28
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
Couldn't feel this moment

29
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,320
The towers swaying in the breeze

30
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
But they could hear it

31
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
Dolphin building speak to you

32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,336
What happens in a tall building is it

33
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,152
In the wind as the building moves

34
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,480
The floor above movies with respect to the floor below

35
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:07,136
My full name is Lester e Robertson I'm a structural engineer and I was responsible for

36
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,440
The design of the World Trade Center

37
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
The Shack is that tape was one of

38
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,352
Many that we took on during the construction and

39
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,144
Later occupation the building

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,984
For each cycle of oscillation the building here to creaking noise

41
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,896
And therefore with you have a tape that you can measure rather precisely the frequency of

42
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
The building itself

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,248
Text 10-second 4 World Trade Center 2

44
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,552
To go to one cycle of oscillation

45
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,536
This concludes the recording at the 67th floor

46
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
Rejection rate

47
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,408
I used to be extremely sound sleeper in the kind of put my head down the pillow and

48
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,784
And go to sleep and sleep for just a short while get up and go to go back to work or do whatever but

49
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,880
It's kind of not like that anymore I just

50
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
Bedtime

51
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,607
I don't I don't have images of the Trade Center in my dreams

52
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
Baidu

53
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
Wake up

54
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
With the thoughts in my head

55
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
But I do but

56
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,663
Instantaneous synonym

57
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,991
As you wipe your eyes you want this out of your mind

58
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,183
People keep saying well and you did everything you could have done the design was the best of could it could be and

59
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,487
You know all those all those thoughts

60
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
Which are

61
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
Nice butt

62
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
I guess I guess

63
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,495
Ultimately the responsibility for

64
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,431
The criteria for the Trade Center that was mine those were my decisions

65
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
And

66
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,367
The fact that they stood up as long as they did

67
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,695
Was because we had

68
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
Design the project for the impact of the

69
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:25,631
707 aircraft and and we had a great team working on the project in

70
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,215
And they did what they were supposed to do

71
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,263
They stood up under the impaction

72
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,687
And while it's true that the the plane that hit it was a bit heavier in a flying a whole lot faster and therefore

73
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,503
A lot more energy was put into the building

74
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:51,231
I think it's a tribute to the people worked on the project at that they did as well as they did

75
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,095
And yet I know as well as I'm here right this moment that

76
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:02,239
That the village could have been made more sour shrimp that could have been made stronger and it could have

77
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
They could have stood up longer

78
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
And

79
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
And that was my decision and I just

80
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:19,903
I thinking that since I can't be faulted

81
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,999
Is performed in many ways admirably

82
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:30,143
But there's always that nagging thought that maybe you should have done something else

83
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
American

84
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
Just push that out of my head

85
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:51,647

A movie or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

100

I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of thing if you

103
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
Two days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop was found

00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,311
Found dead in my private gym

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had something

106
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,015
Nothing to do with it now
