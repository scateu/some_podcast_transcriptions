This is 99% invisible

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,184
I'm Roman Mars in 1898 China granted at 9

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,816
9 year lease to Great Britain for the areas across the harbor the british-controlled island of Hong Kong

36
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:45,216
But smack in the middle of that territory known as Kowloon was an enclave that wasn't included in the

37
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,104
A place that would at least officially still be controlled by the Chinese

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,896
It was a large fort

39
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,736
Built decades earlier to put a check on British expansion

40
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,808
But it evolved into something very

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
Very different

42
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,672
This was the first

43
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,696
Toto

44
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
That I saw that

45
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,608
But why don't you start describe an accident

46
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
Taking it in yet

47
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:18,240
The first analogy that the mind is it looks a little bit like the

48
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
The Borg

49
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,824
Cube from Star Trek

50
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,384
It's a city block

51
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,480
We're not looking at a neighborhood

52
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
That's nestled in

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
In the city

54
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
We're looking at

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
Borg Cube

56
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
But that is in the middle of nowhere

57
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
There skyscrapers behind it

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
Demarcation

59
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
Between

60
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
This neighborhood

61
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Everything else

62
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Staggering

63
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,680
That's my friend Nick vanderkolk from the program love and radio show me photos

64
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
He was the first person who told me about

65
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
Display

66
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
It became known

67
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
Is Kowloon walled City

68
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,664
And even of the walls eventually came down its name was still appropriate

69
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,760
There was no mistaking the boundaries between it and the rest of Hong Kong

70
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,648
I just became a waltz 13-story high-rises overlooking a comparatively sparse Waters

71
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
Buildings evolved

72
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
Drawing tendrils of bridges

73
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
Pipes and wires

74
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Encroach on other building

75
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,912
Until the city turned into a single giant organized

76
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
Because it was an illegal no man's land

77
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:27,104
Not under British jurisdiction but pretty much ignored by the Chinese authorities

78
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,920
It became a magnet for the displaced in the marginal

79
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,248
Thousands of people move their after war with Japan broke out of

80
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
The 30s

81
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,088
And even more move there after the Republic of China went communist

82
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
Attractive gangsters drug addicts

83
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,952
Sex workers refugees

84
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,792
And also do a lot of average people from all over China who needed cheap rent

85
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
And so opportunity

86
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,632
Kowloon walled city was at its height

87
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
The dentist place

88
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
Anywhere

89
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Ever

90
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,568
Had a population density of about 3.2 million people per square mile

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Comparison Manhattan

92
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
Has a population density of about

93
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432
70000 people

94
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Per square mile

95
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
That means that Kowloon walled City

96
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Was about

97
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
46

98
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
X is done

99
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Has Manhattan

100
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
Only put that another way

101
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,232
If Manhattan want to get anywhere close to that kind of density

102
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
Every man woman and child living in Texas

103
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
Would have to move there

104
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,471
I came across it very much by accident

105
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,055
I came around one corner and

106
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
Saw this

107
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
Structure that looked

108
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
Really different than everything else

109
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,015
Around it that's red Gerard

110
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Photographer

111
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,087
He live in Hong Kong in the 80s and 90s

112
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
And that

113
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
When I

114
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
Where is the walled City and

115
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
Started photographing there

116
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,815
Its density was immediately apparent

117
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,631
Buildings have been built

118
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,447
Up against each other without any space between

119
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,055
Each homeowner or each person who rented with

120
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
Build a different kind of caged

121
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
Balcony that would stick out

122
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
A meter or two from their apartment

123
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:14,367
It was a way of opening up the apartment and getting more space and and air and Light

124
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
I went for a first walk into one of the alleys and immediately struck by what's over here

125
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,863
Had enough just angle electrical wires

126
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,215
And wet garbage that have been thrown from the upper floors

127
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,031
TV antennas all over the place

128
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,943
Credible noises from the various manufacturing metalwork small kind of Foundry

129
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
Cotton Mills

130
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:46,111
Kitchen furnaces burning for barbecuing pork or doc or whatever

131
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:51,487
Sunsations underfoot as you go down from Ali's no into

132
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,071
Watery squishy stuff watery squishy stuff

133
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:00,703
You know stuff between buildings that you're walking on I mean I really don't even know what

134
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
All manner of

135
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
Greg took a lot of photographs of the walled City

136
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
There's one probably one of my favorites of his

137
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Lama temple

138
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,831
It's much shorter than the 13-story high-rises around it

139
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
Over the temple is this huge metal grate

140
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,951
If it's there to keep trash off the roof

141
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:28,351
The lifestyle of living in the walled city was to dispose of garbage by throwing it out your window

142
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,423
And so did Temple do a big net above its roof

143
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:37,823
Beautiful Shadow through all this trash

144
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,223
Filter down through some of the bases in the garbage almost like a tropical kind of canopy except this one was moved

145
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Refuse

146
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,807
The new voice you heard is Aaron tan

147
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
Aaron is an architect from Hong Kong

148
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,415
And wrote his master's thesis about the walled City

149
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
Any interviewed a lot of people

150
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Up there

151
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:00,095
Diversity was at his prime times during the 60s and 70s

152
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,655
And it was also the same time where the

153
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
The great thinkers of architecture

154
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,495
Like the Aki grams

155
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:12,127
Body metabolize was talking about this kind of cell organizing structure

156
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,431
Intelligent building thinking

157
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,759
All these things are going on in the West

158
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,111
But not recognizing the existence of the word City actually is doing.

159
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
John Deere header

160
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:28,767
The one city in Hong Kong is growing myself out without any architect working on it

161
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,119
Existence of two one is very theoretical

162
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
What is something very real

163
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,727
And they do not know the existence of each other until

164
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
Much later when

165
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:45,407
Play 80s by Greg Giraldo

166
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
This to think

167
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,735
Giving the same time

168
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,391
Because the walled city was virtually autonomous from both China and Britain there wasn't a lot in the way of Interest

169
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,791
There weren't any building codes obviously and there wasn't any garbage collection either which is why people through the trash at the Wynn

170
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:08,191
DeWalt City gain reputation as a sort of den of iniquity there were high levels of prostitution gambling

171
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,591
Organized crime and for some reason there seems to be a lot of rampant unlicensed Dentistry but

172
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
Kind of order did emerge the Triads who are sort of like a Chinese version of the mafia

173
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
The power vacuum with film rule of law at hygiene

174
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
Jahnetics to clean up the streets

175
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:35,839
And residents organizations pops up and settle disputes between neighbors there's industry to do a fact

176
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:42,239
Factories fishball factories textiles were restaurants in because of Sanitation wasn't Ray it would kill you

177
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,079
Your meal in front of you to prove that they weren't serving you spoiled meat

178
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:52,479
A lot of electricity with pirated someone would tap a cable into the grid and run it over and across the

179
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
Building and then an official would shut it off then somebody would Tap & Grill again lay new cable on

180
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:05,279
On top of the dead shut off and so on so on eventually there were just so many cables

181
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:11,679
Running over and across all the buildings for the Alleyways below we're almost in total darkness

182
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:18,079
You cannot rely on what you see because you get lost right away and all but based on smell you could better

183
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:24,479
Maybe that's selling pork here and then actually doing Suga and Suites

184
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Relying on your

185
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Smell

186
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,831
You can actually navigate to the city Becca

187
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,951
It was said that if you knew your way around the cities of Labyrinth Maze of catwalk

188
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,511
You could walk from one side to the other

189
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
Without ever touching the ground

190
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,079
In the seventies and eighties when the end of the new territories lease was on the horizon

191
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,919
Britain and China begin to figure out what it meant for the future of Hong Kong

192
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,015
And part of that negotiation included the question of what to do

193
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
With the walled City

194
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,391
After three quarters of a century of ambiguity from both countries

195
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,951
They finally agreed on a long eviction process

196
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
Ana 1993

197
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,815
4 years before Britain handed over control of Hong Kong

198
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
China

199
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,119
Kowloon walled City

200
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
Was demolished

201
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,079
But the story of the walled city does not end with its destruction

202
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Lularoe

203
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:34,111
I'm Brian Douglas and I designed the first draft of the Kowloon walled City level in

204
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Call of Duty Black Ops

205
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,719
Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game

206
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,375
Normally you get into like an army situation where it maybe you're in the middle of the street are you up on the second story or something

207
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:52,031
But it's not a very vertically Dynamic world most of the time except visually but we never usually get to get up to those Paul point

208
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
In other words

209
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,847
In most games like this

210
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
The scenery is just

211
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
Scenery

212
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,735
You can't interact with most the visual world that exists off the ground

213
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,343
They usually they're just there to make the world feel fleshed-out and real

214
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,903
So we can actually like will let's go up there

215
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,743
Call of Duty Black Ops is just one of many games to recreate the city

216
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,815
It lives on in a kind of virtual memorial

217
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Picks up with them

218
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
Way more gunfire

219
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,799
This is kind of a level Builders dream because

220
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,847
It provides opportunities

221
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:33,247
So we don't normally get in our first sequence you can see sort of the Liberties that is allowed to take the kids if

222
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
If I needed to just

223
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,831
Make something really sort of crooked and

224
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,695
Awkward it was just all like carb lunch because it really fit into the nature of the city

225
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,255
The doorways weren't necessarily the right size

226
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,327
For the hallways were a little thinner and they Bend in the middle

227
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,143
Some of the feelings were a little taller where it wasn't really

228
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,703
Fully developing were wires coming off of it

229
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,287
You could just imagine what you will for it and it was probably suitable

230
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
I played the Vault City level

231
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:06,015
But actually that's a lie I watched a friend of a friend play because I probably would have died in the fridge

232
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
Anyways

233
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
It's clear that Brian and the other designers

234
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
A lot of thought into each location

235
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
Trencin

236
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,743
A particular room might have a half-eaten meal on the

237
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
There are the signs of a moment in someone's life

238
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,935
But even though the world is full of bad guys trying to shoot you

239
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,495
You come across almost no one who's actually living there

240
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,335
It's easy to lose sight of the fact that this was a real living

241
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
Breathing neighborhood

242
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,503
When you discovered that they were going to be tearing down I mean what did you think about

243
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,087
You should have knew it as a real neighborhood

244
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
Not just assertive

245
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
Fantastical

246
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
Den of iniquity

247
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:50,047
Yeah you know quite mixed feelings I mean the place was completely

248
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:56,447
Unbelievable and it was just a fantastic phenomena this is Greg Gerard again

249
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:03,359
At the same time. Civic-minded part of you knows that this can't and shouldn't continue it was

250
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
Fire hazard to health hazard

251
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,735
One of those things that it fell between the cracks

252
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,063
Andrew their into this beautiful monstrosity

253
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
Aaron the architect has a small ambivalence

254
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,815
I do for me as from architectural for him as very sad to see it go but when I enter

255
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:27,423
Movie with people 20 years later

256
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,823
At some point all this place is smelly is bad and glad he's gone so that now have you seen my new flex as much better

257
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,871
Some people

258
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,431
I have very good memory of the varsity

259
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:44,831
Dymista richness of the space inside the Mystic Community inside the Mystic convenience

260
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
Excited they can get things easily in the city

261
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,695
So you do get this two kind of opinion

262
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
2

263
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,815
But for Aaron there was a value in having a

264
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
Dismantled

265
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,911
As a graduate student he got to observe the city getting take

266
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
Can apart piece-by-piece

267
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
For him it was an autopsy

268
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
Way to see how the various pieces

269
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
The city all fit together

270
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
Is able to build an understanding about how

271
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
Dysfunctional most with their own well

272
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
As an architect

273
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Aaron learn to allow for the

274
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
The sort of organic self-determination

275
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Is projects

276
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,183
Incorporate some lessons of Kowloon walled City into his own work

277
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
Rather than planning

278
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
Everything to a T

279
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
He

280
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,607
He now looks for ways to allow the organic nature of a city

281
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
To organize

282
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,447
We're not saying that this is a wonderful place

283
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,591
We're trying to say that we want to duplicate this model because its existence is so unique

284
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
A position in history

285
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
You cannot recreate it

286
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:49,087
Indie on your head when you look at it it has a sudden of quality in his performance as an organism

287
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,415
In a very restricted constrain

288
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,791
Dad would like a water without electricity know how to organize themselves

289
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:04,191
The trash like I said on one hand you might see the Mount Rushmore

290
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,495
Even a postman

291
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,311
Inside know how to deliver the letters

292
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,895
I'm so it is a kind of good alternative model

293
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
Blood test to evaluate

294
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
Design strategy

295
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,703
99percentinvisible and snap judgement

296
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,775
With some help from Sam Greenspan and me Roman Mars

297
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:46,175
It's a product of 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco in the American Institute of Architects

298
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
Tax in San Francisco

299
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
Between the beats

300
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,111
Bongs and Charter of our devices

301
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,415
We're immersed in a cluttered world

302
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
A man-made sound

303
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:03,327
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

304
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:09,215
Talking to me and my wife is in another voice

305
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Technology

306
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
She talked to us

307
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
It is a creation of Sonic trap

308
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,127
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

309
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,711
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

310
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
To make them more human

311
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
Turn the living room lights on

312
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Okay

313
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Dim the living room lights to 50

314
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
2%

315
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Okay

316
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:38,399
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

317
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,447
Makes for a much more natural

318
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
Experience

319
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
Turn the living room lights on

320
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
Dim the living room lights

321
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
