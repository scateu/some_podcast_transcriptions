00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,536
The Bellevue Stratford Hotel open in Philadelphia in 1904

36
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,376
And quickly became one of the most luxurious hotels of its time

37
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:48,032
It was 19 storytime at over a thousand guest rooms and what was said to be the most lavish and magnificent ball

38
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
United States

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,200
It also featured light fixtures designed by Thomas Edison and a grand marble staircase

40
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:59,552
The hotel came to be known as the Grand Dame of Broad Street

41
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:04,672
And for years the grand on with the center of high society culture in Philadelphia

42
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,024
Who's the presidents and queens and all kinds of other rich and famous guests

That's producer Elana Gordon from WHYY the pulse

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
In Philadelphia

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,752
The hotel went through some hard times during the Great Depression and then again in the fifties and 6

46
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
It was some of the prestige from its early days

47
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,640
But it was always considered one of the nicest places

48
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176
Stay in Philadelphia

49
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,112
That is until the mid-70s when the Bellevue Stratford Hotel became the epicenter of a series of mysterious

50
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
Recent deaths

51
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
That terrified

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
The country

53
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,792
It all started in July of 1976

54
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:48,192
I'm more than 2,000 veterans descended on Philadelphia for the convention of the American Legion a support organ

55
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
Invitation for wartime vets

56
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,288
Statewide convention happens every year

57
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
The 1976

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
What's a really big deal

59
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:01,760
The time and place of the convention have been chosen to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence

60
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,576
Signed in Philadelphia in 1776

61
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
The convention would be held in

62
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
You guessed it

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,696
The Bellevue Stratford Hotel

64
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,792
The Gathering was going to be a big party for the members of the American Legion

65
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Chants for the legionnaires

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
Celebrate and reminisce

67
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
So it's just a big get-together

68
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,288
And then there was a lot of wives and families there at the same time

69
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
That's Jasper Stout

70
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,920
I am a fast Department commander of the American Legion

71
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,600
Stafford drove to the convention from South Central Pennsylvania with his wife

72
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,928
And they wrote up with another couple of some really close friends of theirs

73
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,744
Charlie Chamberlain and his wife Henrietta

74
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
Here's Henrietta who is now 86

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Recalling the trip

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,424
Or we were having a good time down there and everything was going great

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,824
The convention ran for days and the whole thing ended with a big parade of legionnaires through the center of Philadelphia led by

78
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
Brass Band

79
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,896
When the Saints Go Marching In

80
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
That was a real popular song

81
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,808
Henrietta's husband Charlie had just been elected commander of his local Legion Post

82
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
Toyota right up front

83
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,488
It was wonderful we had a wonderful time

84
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:21,375
After the parade Charlie and Henrietta began the drive back home with Jasper and his wife

85
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Charlie

86
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Fell asleep

87
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
Which was spring

88
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,751
He seldom ever

89
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Slept in the car

90
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
Butterfly chair

91
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,199
Whenever we got on the turnpike at Brandywine he went to sleep

92
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,039
He came home and went to bed that night never got out of bed

93
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
I tried to get him better

94
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,623
But every day he got worse

95
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
Charlie's body eight

96
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
His temperature kept going up

97
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
104 degrees

98
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
106 degrees

99
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
Henrietta took him to the hospital

100
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
On Wednesday

101
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
Thursday they put in

102
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
Nice blanket

103
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
And then Friday he was dead

104
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,871
From a flu of unknown cause the doctor

105
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Percent

106
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,711
Charlie Chamberlain was dead at the age of 48

107
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,807
I didn't know what to think nobody else knew what to think that was what it was

108
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
Think about it it was

109
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Photoshop for everybody

110
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
Jasper sell for remembers

111
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
But it was during Charlie's

112
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
Funeral

113
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
He realized

114
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
His friend's death was

115
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
Part of something bigger

116
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
My one of the other members of the

117
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
Headquarters staff

118
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
Was there

119
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
And he said that

120
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,567
The headquarters are getting all kinds of calls

121
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
Some people letters

122
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
Got sick and passed away

123
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
Within a week of the convention region headquarters had started getting calls from around the state about members who

124
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
Fallen ill

125
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,903
But that following Monday

126
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,999
9 days after Charley Chamberlain fell asleep and South first car

127
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,351
News that this mysterious respiratory illness had spread across Pennsylvania

128
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
No one knew what it cost it

129
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,447
But the legionnaires were getting sick

130
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
I've been at the Bellevue Stratford for the convention

131
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,063
Health leaders back in Philadelphia soon caught wind that something was up

132
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,439
Dr. Robert Schuller was director of infectious diseases for the City's health department at the time

133
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
All of a sudden

134
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,815
I had four lines coming from Office off for lunch or let up at the same time

135
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,399
SMS said there's there's some sort of an outbreak going on

136
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,471
The death toll logged by the state kept growing

137
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
11

138
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:40,383
They called in federal investigators from the Center for Disease Control and prevention in Atlanta

139
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,223
The man charged with overseeing that investigation was David Fraser

140
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,551
He's originally from Philly and he was 32 at the time

141
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
He was the director of the CDC

142
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
Special pathogens unit

143
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439
It's been a very intense

144
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
Plane ride trying to

145
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,559
Figure out how would I systematically

146
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,607
Begin to approach what

147
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,911
Look to be a very complicated problem

148
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,495
Within 48 Hours of his arrival

149
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,823
The death toll was near in 20 with dozens more sick

150
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,431
Some fear this mysterious pneumonia could be the start of a swine flu outbreak

151
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Or worse

152
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,575
Flu pandemic like the one that had killed 50 million people in 1918

153
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135
The authorities readied themselves for the worst

154
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,975
As many as 100 state and federal workers were called in

155
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,535
About 50 police detectives took part

156
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,351
This is the biggest investigation CDC undertook

157
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,679
We needed to define the illness

158
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Gosip

159
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,007
Was potentially a new disease

160
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,335
News reporters were already giving it a name

161
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Legionnaires

162
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
All might

163
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,015
Medical data is being flown in by helicopter

164
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,719
Everybody in the state of Pennsylvania know about it we had worldwide recognition weird phone calls from as far away as Australia

165
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,511
Asking his questions about

166
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:07,679
But scientists still had no idea what was causing the illness they was a bacteria a virus or some sort of

167
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
They had to tease out a pattern

168
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
Pennsylvania

169
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,103
Health investigators are talking to the more than 100 patients

170
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,807
What did they do at the American Legion convention where they all together at a single time

171
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,111
Or gathered in one location

172
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
Question after question

173
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Brian fat commonly

174
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,047
Define answers

175
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,863
David Fraser and his investigative Squad cast

176
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
A wide net

177
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,239
Which means we had to send physician epidemiologist out to

178
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,055
Take histories from and examine

179
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
A large number of people

180
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,919
They monitor the people who have gotten sick and their families

181
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
But they also wanted to talk

182
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,271
People who'd been at the convention who hasn't gotten sick

183
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,855
And because there was no Central list of who had attended

184
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,183
They distributed questionnaires to hundreds of Legion Post

185
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Throughout the state

186
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
And to have a comparison group

187
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:08,863
They telephoned random samples of people who weren't even at the convention

188
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,007
And through all this research it became clear early on that this was not the major flu pandemic that some had feared

189
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,847
The disease seemed confined to the legionnaires convention but still

190
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,175
Razor remembers public pressure mounting to figure this out

191
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
This was a time when

192
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:29,087
Infectious diseases were thought to have been largely worked out

193
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,367
And control

194
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
It challenges

195
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,487
And it increase the fear

196
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,535
Maybe it was something people ate

197
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
Or drag

198
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
Some people even thought it could have been an act

199
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,167
Bioterrorism by disgruntled batch

200
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
Investigators were stumped

201
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,031
But Roberts RR with Philadelphia's Health Department

202
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,359
Says they did have one General suspect in mine

203
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
It was called the Grand Old Lady of Broad Street

204
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,223
That's what I've always heard it referred

205
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
And she was the Grand

206
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
Survivor says the grand old lady

207
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
Sun save the ground down

208
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
But yes

209
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,231
He's referring to the Bellevue Stratford Hotel

210
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
Hotel

211
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,351
Perhaps this iconic landmark of the city was the Killer

212
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:17,983
Investigators flagged it in the reports and it didn't take long for this to become a media Frenzy

213
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,847
Stratford may still hold the key to solving the mystery of Legionnaires disease

214
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
Somewhere in this hotel there maybe

215
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Being environment

216
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,967
And it was like Hysteria

217
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
Steve Hornsby

218
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,807
He was a doorman at the Bellevue at the time of the outbreak

219
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,159
Bright-eyed 21 year old looking to break into the hotel business

220
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,999
He remembers people started calling in to cancel reservation

221
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
Beer the place

222
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,863
An anything or anyone associated with it

223
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,423
I was dating young lady and I remember she

224
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,959
She told me her Mom 2

225
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
Didn't want me to come to the house and

226
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
Anymore because I work

227
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Did the Bellevue

228
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
And the hotel was losing gas

229
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
We were going down for the

230
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Account NH

231
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Gay

232
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Would get a little worse

233
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
They would have the engineer turn on

234
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
Lamps

235
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,831
The Broad Street room so that the lights are on

236
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,623
In the evening it wasn't all dark

237
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
That's how bad it got

238
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:14,815
Bedford David Fraser the director of the CDC special pathogens unit

239
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
There was only one way to get to the bottom of this

240
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,751
After spending the first week of the investigation in the state capital of Harrisburg

241
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
He and several others

242
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,335
Join the Philadelphia crew on the ground

243
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
Guess where they stayed

244
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
Because

245
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
There were rooms available

246
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
And we got a good price

247
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,343
Fraser brought his team to the Bellevue

248
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
He really wanted to solve this mystery

249
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,743
There was part of me that was hoping that somebody got sick

250
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
He's only half joking

251
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
This might give an important clue

252
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,167
They got to work trying to figure out the source of a disease

253
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,983
Maybe it was somehow traveling through the Elevator Shaft

254
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
And I thought perhaps

255
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
Validated

256
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Permit

257
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
An agent

258
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
2

259
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
Walk into the air

260
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
As the elevator went up and down

261
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,039
But we found no evidence

262
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,367
Other theories blame the pigeons perched on the window ledge

263
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,463
Maybe the pigeons were thesaurus maybe the lady who

264
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,767
Feed the pigeons out on the sidewalk

265
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
What was the

266
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,351
In the end they came up with AIDS

267
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
First

268
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,447
The more time people spend in the lobby of the hotel

269
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
The more at risk they were for Contracting the disease

270
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
And second

271
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,127
The more time people spent just outside the hotel on the sidewalk

272
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
The greater the risk

273
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,271
Even some people who had nothing to do with a hotel or the convention had gotten sick

274
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
If they spent time on the sidewalk

275
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
None of David Fraser staff became ill while staying in the hotel but they also couldn't figure out what it was about the place

276
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,023
Forgotten everyone else sick

277
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,839
And so people's fear of the building persistence

278
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,143
And in November of 1976

279
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,471
The grand AMA Broad Street was forced to close

280
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:02,591
It already been in financial trouble but the outbreak was the final fatal blow

281
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:09,503
It was the end of an era for very elegant hotel with all kinds of memories in Philadelphia history

282
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:15,647
It was the final day today for the grand old Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia battered

283
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
Finally done in by the fact that people died after attending the American Legion convention there

284
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,655
Vinyl party hornstein helps lock the place up

285
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,471
We had to put the chains on the door at the front door and

286
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
We put it around the

287
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
Grab handles

288
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,335
Couldn't open with a padlock

289
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
It was like a death sentence

290
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,455
I don't think they'll ever be out another hotel that big and bustling

291
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
Like that one was on Broad Street

292
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
Back in the CBC labs

293
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,719
Scientist continued reviewing samples and running more tests

294
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
Weeks went by

295
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,815
It was a very high pressure

296
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
Very frustrating

297
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,679
David Fraser and his colleagues were eventually called in to

298
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
To Congress

299
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
To account for why they

300
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
Still haven't solved the miss

301
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,823
We expected to be raked over the coals

302
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
For failing to solve

303
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:11,199
Not break and we were raped over the coals it was a very unpleasant couple of hours

304
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
Fraser worried about morale

305
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,879
Some of the CDC scientist had spent years trying to solve other outbreaks with no success

306
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,951
Which I was afraid was going to set in with legionnaire

307
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
Did you think maybe it would take years

308
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Yes

309
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
I hope

310
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,911
It would only take years

311
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
5 and a half months have passed since the first death

312
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
Around 30 people had died

313
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
The grand Dom had closed

314
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
Things were not looking good

315
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,711
And then finally

316
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
The CDC caught a break

317
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:52,671
A scientist named Joseph McDade was coming through all the biological specimens they collected from victims lung

318
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
And re-examining them

319
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,255
Looking for something he might have missed

320
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:02,399
McDade said this process was like looking for a contact lens on the floor of a basketball court

321
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
But then

322
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
Finally on December 27

323
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
He found that contact lens

324
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,871
In his microscope it look like a red cluster of tiny rods

325
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,711
MacDade ran tests and found these tiny rods were part of the bacteria

326
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
One they hadn't seen before

327
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:23,135
Within a few weeks they confirm that this was indeed the bacteria that it cause the disease

328
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
On January 17th

329
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,231
1977

330
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
CDC scientist

331
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
Announce their findings with great

332
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Fanfare

333
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
I was so excited

334
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,703
This was such a spec Tidings of great weight off my

335
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Shoulders

336
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,031
And a great discovery

337
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,847
Very very special discovery

338
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
They called the new bacteria

339
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
Legionella pneumophila

340
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,991
They had found the Fatal bacteria

341
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,319
David Fraser and his colleagues went from being humiliated

342
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
To congratulate it

343
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
But wait a minute

344
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,743
Where have the bacteria come from

345
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:04,863
This question wouldn't be answered until a couple years after the bacteria was to

346
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Discovered

347
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:11,007
David Fraser retraces two steps around the outside of the Bellevue

348
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,823
Nearly 40 years after the outbreak

349
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,175
The Grand Hotel was restored and reopened in 1979

350
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
He points up to the very top of the building group

351
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
There are cooling towers

352
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Which

353
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Wood

354
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Operate

355
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
To eject key

356
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
From from the hotel

357
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:33,279
Further explains that Legionella bacteria occurs naturally in the environment

358
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,839
Can make it hard to pin down a specific

359
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Bookstores

360
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
But it really likes to grow in warm water

361
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,775
And one ideal environment is the warm water basins in air conditioning

362
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
Window systems convert warm water into

363
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Cold air

364
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
A produce a mess

365
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
As a by-product

366
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
And that Miss

367
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
Can come across the

368
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,783
Edge of the roof

369
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
And layer down the side of a building

370
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,415
One of the curious things about airflow in cities

371
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,255
If that missed carries Legionella bacteria and is inhaled

372
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
I can make you sick

373
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:11,935
That's why people who are right outside the hotel and inside the front lobby where most likely to get infected

374
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,007
Fraser says contaminated mist from the Bellevue

375
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
Cooling tower

376
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
Would have likely

377
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,103
Drop down the side of the hotel

378
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
Exposing people on the sidewalk

379
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
And then I hear some of these

380
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Utility

381
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,551
Vets here it also would have been stuck into event near the ground

382
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
But we've right into the front lobby

383
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Frozen people there

384
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:39,327
The air conditioning system had always been a possible culprit as a breeding ground for the Legionella bacteria

385
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,983
The CBC couldn't say for sure right away because the bellevue-stratford is cooling system have been thoroughly cleaned follow

386
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Outbreak

387
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,567
By the time the CDC got there to get samples

388
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,127
There was no Legionella bacteria present

389
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
But as the years passed

390
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,503
There were more outbreaks of legionnaires in other places

391
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
And in those instances

392
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
They were able to confirm that the bacteria

393
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
Had come from the cooling

394
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,767
Researchers retroactively link the bacteria to previously unsolved outbreak

395
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,375
Including a smaller one at the Bellevue a couple years before the 76

396
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
Legionnaires convention

397
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
In the Public Health Community the story of Legionnaires disease has turned into a sort of poster child

398
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
Power of epidemiology

399
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,271
That's true leather detective work that's used to map out patterns and understand how diseases move and strike

400
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:35,135
But unfortunately the discovery of the disease didn't lead to its demise

401
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,719
The government now has recommendations

402
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,279
For how to design and maintain cooling system

403
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,839
So they're not breeding grounds for Legionella

404
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,655
But even though the disease is treatable

405
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
There are still a lot of cases

406
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,543
In 2015 New York had an outbreak that was traced

407
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
National opera house in the Bronx

408
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,919
12 people died and more than 120 became sick

409
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
As for the bellevue-stratford

410
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:08,415
Cleaning the cooling tower is now a routine part of the building's maintenance

411
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
They also analyze water samples

412
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,791
Enduring a major Restoration in 80

413
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,375
The hotel got a completely new Heating and Cooling

414
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,983
These days business is good for the crime Tom a frost strain

415
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,055
The hotel now owned by Hyatt has been modernized

416
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
Play still has that classic

417
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,687
Rooms run upwards of $500 a night

418
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,223
And future king size beds

Bongs and chatter of our devices

435
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,175
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

436
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,807
If I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis
