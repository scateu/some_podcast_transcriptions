This is 99% invisible

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
I'm Roman Mars

19
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
This is from Twitter

20
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,800
Hey Roman Mars and 99 PIR

21
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,592
Have a burning question for you

22
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,176
Why do us flags on military vehicles and uniform

23
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,712
Always appear.

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
That's from Michael McAuliffe

25
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
Well first of all their only backwards part of the time military regulations state that when a flag is displayed it must give the effect

26
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:37,280
That flag flying in the breeze is it the person wearing it is moving forward

27
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,328
Till the patches on the left arm

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
The flag is displayed as you normally

29
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,448
Take a bath with that blue star field in the upper left-hand corner

30
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496
But if the flag patches on the right

31
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,312
It's the reverse side flag that's display

32
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,128
With the blue star field in the upper right-hand corner

33
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
Singles for vehicles the blue star field always points towards the front of a vehicle as if it's flying North charging

34
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
Forward to Victory

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,136
So if you're looking at the right side of a tank or an aircraft

36
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
You'll see

37
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
The reverse fly

38
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:15,168
This is part 2 of the mini Stories episode where I interview the staff about their favorite little design stories that don't quite fit

39
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,472
Go out the entire episode for whatever reason

40
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,288
They are cooled 99ci stories than the last

41
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:26,176
Plus in between the staff stories I'll be telling a few mini story suggested by You Beautiful nerds

42
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,016
Who enjoy having me paraphrase Google search results Android

43
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
Up first

44
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Senior editor

45
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Katie Mingle

46
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,048
My name is Katie mingle and I am the senior editor

47
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
What does that mean

48
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,680
I do the same stuff that we all do in some ways which is like

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,104
Find stories and report on them and make them but I also edit a lot so I look it

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Other people's stories

51
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,480
On paper before they go to like a larger group at it and I

52
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
Cut like

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,832
5 Pages out of every story

54
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,880
I probably cut like

55
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
4 minutes

56
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
Send

57
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,536
Sometimes do some restructuring and just kind of try to get it ready

58
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
So that it's

59
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:19,936
A little more smooth when the whole group looks at it

60
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
In every story

61
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,288
You have worked on every story because you've added it almost

62
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:31,456
Yes I'm lurking behind every 99 Pi story

63
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
Do Pit stories and so part of

64
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,552
Coming up with story ideas is basically just

65
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
Trolling around the internet

66
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,136
Trying to find things to turn things into

67
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
Stories NFL

68
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
Yeah he was amounts of time just like

69
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
Following links

70
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,656
That's sort of like how this one came about and I ended up on this YouTube video about this place called the biker

71
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
The wall which is

72
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
Is in Newcastle England

73
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:59,872
And it's being narrated by the swimming and wearing this amazing stuff double-breasted suit jacket and shoes

74
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:06,016
She's just super super 80s her name is Beatrix Campbell in the video she started walking around outside

75
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,576
The biker wall or the biker estate

76
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
A pig

77
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
Small

78
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
It's cheap and cheerful

79
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
It's Tricky

80
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Clever

81
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:23,167
I don't really know how it's big and small but and I'm not sure that ever week ever really figure

82
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:28,031
You're that out so the structure or the sort of estate that she's talking about

83
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
It actually replace

84
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,359
An entire neighborhood

85
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
So let me just give you a little background

86
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,479
In 1963 in New Castle England

87
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:41,087
A 17000 resident working-class neighborhood called biker

88
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135
Sault Sainte the same name as

89
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
This new place

90
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:50,303
Was demolished because it was considered a slum and I think there are a lot of vacancies

91
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
And the neighborhood was made up of sort of Victorian Row Housing and like if you've ever seen the movie Billy Elliot

92
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,079
And you can like picture hands are dancing through these like

93
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,127
Brick houses and

94
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,711
Really really close together narrow streets and that's

95
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,015
That's the old biker

96
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,879
At the old biker and I think that movie was actually filmed a really close to

97
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
The old biker neighborhood

98
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:24,095
Street-by-street the old songs with cleared one straight line straight the new bike it was built

99
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,191
Neighborhood of brick row houses this architect named Ralph

100
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
Skin

101
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
Built

102
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
The new place

103
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
Which is called biker wall or or sometime

104
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
Biker estate

105
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
And it's a community of public housing that

106
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
Is enclosed by this

107
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
Great big wall of

108
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,439
The wall is a mile and a half long and it provides a barrier to winds coming

109
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,511
Kind of off the North Sea and also

110
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,815
Highway noise there's like a big

111
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,095
Freeway

112
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Bestway nearby

113
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
And it kind of

114
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,191
Creates this sort of microclimate within the

115
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Community

116
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:06,335
So it's basically this big wall that should have wraps around these other buildings and closing them

117
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,431
Campbell at she has some very

118
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Vivid

119
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,039
Descriptions on but she says the way it's constructed

120
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
I'm laid out never mind her

121
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Pomegranate

122
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
It's kind of like

123
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
Prodigious

124
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
I saw sweet places inside

125
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Yeah

126
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,703
And if you're feeling like

127
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
At all

128
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,055
Like that was a little sexual it gets like there's more

129
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
What does all this mean for architecture

130
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
Is it mountainous

131
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
A postmodernist

132
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
Pusher

133
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,575
It's a bonus use aggressive family confidential all those gray erections

134
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855
To the skyline

135
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
Previous vulva

136
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
It's round

137
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
It goes with the Contours of the landscape

138
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
It's an enclosure rather than a disclosure

139
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
What does nooks and crannies

140
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
Layers and levels and surprises

141
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
Annies

142
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:17,247
Yeah if you didn't hear that is aggressive phallic architecture

143
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
And it was great erections

144
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,599
Skyline Boulevard

145
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,927
Does gray directions

146
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,999
So great

147
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
So I found this

148
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
Please send I was sort of like

149
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,239
I want to put this on me are basically just to get

150
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,799
This lady and her

151
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
Volvo architecture theories

152
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
On our podcast like I don't know if there's a story here but I want there to be

153
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:54,879
A little cool things about by Corso

154
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:59,231
It's kind of neat about it Ralph Erskine the architect

155
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,839
He was a socialist and a Quaker and he really wanted to build a place that fostered

156
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Community

157
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
And he'd also studied buildings in the Arctic and how they were constructed to sort of Shield the inner Courtyard

158
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,639
Words from from winds coming in from the outside and she wanted to do something similar but

159
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:21,503
Not Justa Shield it from winds but also just to enclose the residence in this

160
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,135
Fulvic Unearthed contrived

161
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:32,255
Really really hard to involve a bunch of the residents from the old biker

162
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
In the redesign of the new one

163
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
But

164
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
Despite his

165
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,727
3 best efforts not that many of the original residents ended up living there

166
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:48,895
Eventually in the 80s the place kind of turns a little bit back into a slum there's a lot of

167
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:53,503
Was crying and in vacancies and a lot of the places sort of fall into disrepair

168
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
The guardian

169
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,135
Said this about the biker the New Biker estate

170
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,927
For all its faults

171
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,071
Biker wall was an Exemplar of both design and an attempt to involve the community in the changes

172
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,375
Plan for them by those in power

173
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
That it failed in so many ways reveals that it's rarely in the interests of communities to demolish the home

174
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
They live in

175
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
Yeah so that's to me that's just sort of like

176
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,967
You can try really hard to do it right

177
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
And it

178
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Still

179
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Mike

180
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
Come out wrong

181
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,999
So in Beatrice Campbell the the YouTube lady she she admits that the place is flawed but she still

182
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
Explode a car but at least unlike most of its contemporaries

183
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
Both monumental

184
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
It's a social space

185
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Undomestic

186
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,663
There's something about this place

187
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:01,855
Okay so I don't know if you can understand her last line there but she says there's something lighthearted about this place something love

188
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Audible

189
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
Eminem if I love that if you scroll down just a little ways that the comment on the video says

190
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:15,167
They didn't tell them it was Carl orff 24/7 in this place

191
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,567
Carl orff I think with that comment is getting at is that it was real

192
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
The kind of dark

193
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,431
A place to live because Carl orff wrote this

194
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
10

195
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
That's pretty dark

196
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
Liquor well

197
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
Thank you Katie

198
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Yeah

199
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,807
In 2014 the biker Community Trust are they multimillion-dollar revamp up

200
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,903
With lots of improvements including Broadband in every property

201
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
It's not all Carl orff

202
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
If indeed it ever was

203
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Tell me who you are

204
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,935
I am sure effusive assistant producer

205
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
99 pi

206
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
What does that mean what are you

207
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:28,383
I've sort of do a lot of the pro tool stuff so I'm working with the actual tape for a lot of The Producers stories

208
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:34,015
Scoring sound design a lot of the pieces I do research in fact-checking so I basically do

209
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
Whatever needs to be done it's a what is you were

210
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
So things that are

211
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,927
Creative are relatively simple to copyright

212
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
Erratic song

213
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Copyright

214
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
You write a book

215
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,583
Did you get copyrighted it's easy to prove that you've done this thing

216
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
But a question arises

217
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
When

218
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
You tried to copyright something that is

219
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
Based in fact

220
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,311
Some sort of objective reality like the definition of a word in dictionary

221
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,127
Entry for a person and inside

222
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Or

223
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,455
In this case

224
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,551
Maps when I know you like a good math story. I love a good night story yasso

225
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,111
This story is about a town called

226
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
Agloe New York

227
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
And it was in the 1930s

228
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
The general drafting company

229
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,047
What's creating a map of New York State

230
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,703
So they put in a lot of hours and lot of Manpower detailing all the rivers and gorges and Finger Lakes and

231
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,055
Pounds and he said we put in so much work you know we have to protect our investment

232
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,871
So they set a copyright trap

233
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,199
Near the northwest corner of Pennsylvania

234
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,991
Just a couple miles into New York

235
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
I've a put a little town

236
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
Next to Roscoe New York

237
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
Call

238
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Idaho

239
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
An aglow I believe is actually

240
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,767
A jumble of the initials of the founders names agloe

241
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
And so they put this on the map

242
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
And

243
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
They know that if

244
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Another map

245
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
Shows iglow New York

246
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,983
That person was copying there

247
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
Yeah exactly

248
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
So they create this fictitious town

249
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
It's on the map

250
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,407
And it's like soldan Esso stations around movie

251
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
The state

252
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
And for a while everything is all honky

253
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Chidori

254
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
But then several years later

255
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
Another map comes out

256
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,623
And they open the map

257
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
And

258
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
Lo and behold

259
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,999
I got it was on it this company is called Rand McNally drafting

260
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
Busted busted

261
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:28,447
Yeah that's what they thought so the general drafting company goes yo Rand McNally you stole our map and where

262
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:33,055
Going to sue you and Rand McNally is like no no wait this is an actual place

263
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
Let's go and take a look

264
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
Intelligent

265
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
And Company people are like

266
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
Okay sure take us to a glow

267
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
So that goes place where I glow

268
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Should be

269
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,879
And lo and behold there is actually a big General Store there

270
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
Small General Store actually

271
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
And it's called The agloe General Store

272
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,559
And there a couple houses maybe 2 at its peak

273
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,607
So The Story Goes

274
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:01,983
Some people maybe from the neighboring towns wanted to this place wanted to build a general store

275
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,079
Saw that the map said I glow is here but nothing was there

276
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
So

277
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,407
When they wanted to build the story they just

278
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,247
Slapped on me I glow name so this place that was created as a

279
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
Fictitious copyright trap

280
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
Start of spring up into reality

281
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
So this sort of

282
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,439
Became famous because author John Green

283
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
I wrote a book

284
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:27,327
Call Paper Towns. Miss settin agloe New York and he gave a tedx talk

285
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,375
About I go New York and about

286
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
The concept of paper

287
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,471
Paper Towns as well since turned into a movie

288
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,519
So we thought the story might not be a great

289
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,335
Fit for us because people in our audience minority

290
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:42,687
Be really familiar with him yeah but we can talk about it a little bit and if you want to learn more

291
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,759
You should look up John Green because he and his brother Hank

292
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
If these great videos

293
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
But you are all kinds of things I know people

294
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
You like the show

295
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Totally love

296
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
What they do on you

297
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
And you are

298
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,127
I'm Turk Cole said that I'm the digital director at 99% invisible and describe what that means

299
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
Sure I produce a web stories for the show

300
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,247
And I take care of all of our digital

301
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
So

302
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Several

303
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Years ago

304
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
But I remember being

305
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
In the waiting room waiting

306
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Maslow's

307
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
In surgery

308
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
I got an email

309
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
From a firefight

310
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
And she said

311
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
Do you know anything

312
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
About Knox

313
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,079
Which of these little invisible elements you see everywhere in urban environment you probably never noticed

314
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
So please tell us

315
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
What is

316
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
Enochs

317
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,223
Yeah Knox Box in simple terms is a rapid entry system

318
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,527
It allows emergency personnel

319
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,087
To get into buildings quickly when there's a disaster

320
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
So for example

321
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
When there's a fire in your apartment building

322
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,743
And the fire department is trying to get in quickly

323
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
They show up they open an Xbox get out of key

324
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
And into the building

325
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,167
So the Scarlet like physically so it's like a little box that sort of

326
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
Up against the wall

327
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,615
Typically be found within a few feet of an entryway to ilvl the black box

328
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
Usually

329
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,455
With a little red on it so it's easy to spot

330
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
To the fire department shows up

331
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
They grabbed hold this little box

332
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,367
And the user master key to open it and it should be

333
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
And there's a fire inside

334
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Didn't want to break in in

335
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,279
All the doors and windows they just if there's a key available they can use it

336
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,631
Write an emergency they're not worried about you know the property damage of course

337
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
That's a vibe

338
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,543
They're worried about injuring themselves right so they have to break glass door and jump through through that glass door

339
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
That puts them at greater risk

340
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,919
The building this season time

341
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,503
Reduces injury injury risk and Chestnut

342
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:59,135
Is why does the whole system work so they they have a master key that opens up all the knocks boxes

343
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
Right so their master key

344
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,487
Out of all the black boxes

345
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,887
For all the different buildings and that means when they arrive at a building they don't have to sort through bunch of keys figure out how they're going to get into a particular building

346
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,423
I just whip out their one key

347
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,495
Stick it in the lock box open it up and inside of that

348
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,311
They will find whatever key they need to access that particular bill

349
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
What is the name Knox

350
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,431
Knox is a company that produces a lot of these box

351
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,527
And technically generically you might call the rapid entry system

352
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,831
Knock make so many of them that

353
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,391
If he has become an everyday sort of household name for these

354
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Knock knock

355
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,047
Cool so like if you were in any populated area

356
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
You

357
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
Will see a ton of these right

358
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,191
There everywhere you are surrounded by Knox boxes

359
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Basically anywhere you go

360
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
You probably pass

361
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
A dozen or so of these just walking down the street everyday

362
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,687
So on every block very city you'll find some equivalent of a Knox Box

363
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,503
Ashley outside the building and once you start seeing these

364
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
You will see them

365
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,439
At a high level they're made to be seen and yet they're somehow strangely invisible until you start notice

366
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,303
This is one of those great examples of a short story that was just

367
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,655
It's an anecdote multi-story so it made sense just put it up on the web

368
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
And

369
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
In Call of Duty

370
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,799
Rick Astley have a whole website tomorrow at 9 p.m.

371
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
Thanks to Nikki Leigh

372
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
Former firefighter putting Knox

373
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Suggestion all those years ago

374
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:38,719
Last week I got this mini storage suggestion from Tucson Arizona resident Megan Phillips

375
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
In Tucson

376
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
Roads running East-West or called Street

377
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,583
Rhodes running

378
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
South record Avenue

379
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,679
Makes sense but what is unique to Tucson

380
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
Is that any Diagonal row

381
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
Roads are called

382
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
Stravenue

383
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
A portmanteau

384
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
Street

385
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Penn Avenue

386
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,639
That is an official designation it's not just slay

387
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
Letting that's pretty cool

388
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:03,295
When I got me cuz. I was sitting next to famous portmanteau skeptic Helen zaltzman of The Illusionist

389
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,879
It's where you took his acclaimed Word podcast and I asked her what she thought

390
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
I know your dental opinion portento is

391
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Pretty

392
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,279
Negative I think

393
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
Leprechaun size a used for

394
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,887
Is to express a concept

395
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
You don't have a proper term

396
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,519
And it's 7 related to Concepts that you do already have * 4

397
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
However

398
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,823
In this case

399
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
I feel like the hunters

400
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,687
Fixing a problem that doesn't really exist

401
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,015
Unstoppable miss the people of Tombstone

402
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,575
Adjust very much too dependent

403
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,367
I'm things either paying streets

404
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
All avenues

405
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,439
Anthem

406
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,791
I am come from Britton which does not have such a binary right naming system

407
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
Say that you might get a street

408
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
They School the street or roads

409
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,703
On Avenue or Crescent

410
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,543
Apple Lovato not even have a roadster mitul

411
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,847
And It Go in any direction

412
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,151
Live and Let Live Tucson

413
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,783
Is it very prodesign progrid show I'm sorry that you had to hear that minor

414
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
But I assure you

415
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:14,463
Helen zaltzman The Illusionist is a fantastic podcast that will teach entertain you about words in the strange consequences

416
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Language

417
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,535
They won't have Helen planning my city

418
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
Cuz grids rule

419
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
Man

420
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
I'm so excited to

421
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:35,199
I was about to say I'm so excited to get this story out of my system but honestly I still think it would make

422
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:39,039
I think everyone who's wrong and I think I'm right and I wanted to

423
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,391
REI

424
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,719
Don't be a Groundswell that they need to know the whole story at the end

425
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:52,863
Maybe maybe I'm just worried that people hear it and be like oh yeah I know it

426
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
That doesn't work which would mean

427
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,495
Totally crazy

428
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
I'm Avery truffelman

429
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
What are you doing here

430
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,871
I'm a producer at 99percentinvisible

431
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,943
So we're telling all the type of stories that we

432
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,015
Can't tell on the radio for various reasons maybe they were

433
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,367
Little parts of stories that got cut out because they're too confusing maybe they were

434
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,464
You're like a little too small to constitute like putting the whole episode about

435
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
But this one

436
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,560
This one this one is different

437
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
Why the difference

438
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,960
This was supposed to be my magnum opus

439
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,776
The One That Got Away I mean I mean it like

440
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
2 years ago

441
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,616
And so at the time it was

442
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:40,992
This is it I was already planning out like the t-shirts we would sell about this episode

443
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
And

444
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,552
It just it didn't happen

445
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
Okay so what is this doing

446
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,624
This is about the most

447
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Iconic

448
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
Poster in the world

449
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,720
Is a poster we've all seen

450
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,280
Is it supposed to say we have all been forced

451
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
See

452
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:01,472
It is this

453
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
Can you read that line there

454
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,056
D a o

455
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
6

456
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,664
It is that pyramid arrangement of black letters on a white background

457
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,968
Is usually got a biggie at the top

458
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,528
Nice line of letters get progressively smaller

459
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
Is a vision chart

460
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
And it has

461
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
Official name

462
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
What's the name

463
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Is called

464
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
The Snellen chart

465
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
After the Dutch ophthalmologist

466
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,536
Herman Snellen who invented it

467
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
1860

468
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,632
Eevee

469
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,680
Otz

470
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
2

471
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Perfectly

472
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,520
The way it works

473
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
Is that you read off the series of letters

474
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
Annie's line

475
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,152
And he get the majority right

476
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
You get to move to the neck

477
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,808
Went to a bunch of ophthalmologist

478
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,600
A bunch of times

479
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
And according to

480
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,160
Mira Lim

481
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
This

482
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
They kind of pomologist

483
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
To work at the street from us

484
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,304
By convention you always use the Snellen chart

485
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,608
This just works well it's what everybody has

486
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,472
And a big part of why the Snellen chart works really well

487
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
Is because

488
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
Easy

489
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
Memorize

490
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
And a lot of

491
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,616
Ophthalmologist

492
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
Eye doctor

493
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
Have memorized their chart

494
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,480
ESL ca va

495
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
D806

496
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,576
Eg a new 5S BBD for

497
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,856
Oflc

498
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
Team

499
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,952
Apeo 25 e.

500
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
There you go

501
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
Wow so that's just her

502
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,656
She just read a little about it then

503
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,704
They don't have to like

504
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,104
Squint with you to like make sure you got each one right or they don't even have to follow along in a paper like if they have it memorized

505
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:50,272
I ended up wrong and they can assess you really quickly which if you're not a doctor you're doing this

506
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,832
Every single patient and then this makes

507
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,648
Add minutes to your day

508
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
You have it memorized

509
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
So the Snellen chart

510
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
Is Iconic you can see it online

511
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,376
Mugs and tie them whatever is everywhere just that layout is classic

512
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,824
An obvious problem

513
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
The way the test works

514
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,920
You read the line you get the majority right

515
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,224
And then you get to go to the next line

516
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,784
But if every line has a different

517
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,112
Amount of letters on it it's basically a different test every time

518
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,392
You can get

519
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
One line is okay to get

520
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,000
Arirang the next line it's okay to get whatever

521
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
Foreign

522
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,096
Is a different test every time you have different odds

523
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
If you got

524
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,680
Three out of five right in the 2020 Rio you will be

525
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
Peking 2020

526
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
If I Stay

527
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
Let me repeat that

528
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
And you only got two days

529
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
In that same row

530
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Now you would have

531
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,200
The shockingly imprecise it's unbelievable

532
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
That is Doctor Ian Bailey

533
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,600
And in the 70s he helped design a more precise vision chart

534
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
That has

535
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,160
Five letters on every

536
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,184
Single line

537
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,000
I think at chat design could be

538
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
Compared with

539
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,816
Designing a ruler

540
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,656
Where you say why don't we make the markings on the ruler

541
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
Of the same size

542
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,520
It seems obvious

543
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,056
And so he has

544
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
5 big letters at the top

545
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
5 letters

546
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
Find five letters in the next line

547
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
All space

548
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,200
Equally apart

549
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,480
Very precise

550
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,784
But if you visualize it for a second

551
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
Instead of one

552
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,112
Giant letter at the top

553
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,648
There are five

554
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,928
Giant letters

555
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
At the top

556
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
Which means that it is a physically bigger

557
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,656
Chart it's just wider and also that means it looks more like an upside-down pyramid

558
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
T25

559
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,472
Really big letters with.

560
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,776
And then five smaller letters in it

561
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,056
Smaller letters

562
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:55,456
How to get tiny tiny tiny but it's still always fine exactly and then he also had to pick which letters

563
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
To use

564
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,296
And so some letters are more confusable like

565
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
CNG

566
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,136
What is a very distinct like Z

567
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
A

568
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,304
And so he also had this like design challenge of making sure that you wouldn't have one line of lifo either letters and one line of difficult letter

569
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,584
To make sure they distribute

570
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,632
And you also to make sure

571
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
But there wasn't like

572
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:21,312
Cuz he designed it in Australia and you want to make sure nnz were next to each other people be like oh New Zealand and like

573
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,896
Create associations with with shapes

574
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,200
So yeah it was like it was a really tough

575
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,224
Start to design

576
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,624
Battlelog bar chart chart it is one of many improved charts but the

577
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,744
Problem is so yeah the chart is a lot bigger and wider physically it takes up more wall space

578
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
It's a lot of offices

579
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,328
Can't actually accommodate

580
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,656
And since there are five letters on every row it means

581
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,448
There more letters for doctors

582
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,472
Memorize

583
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
And actually

584
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
Dr. Bailey

585
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
Exactly

586
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,456
I can still remember the Snellen chart that I used to have when I was in

587
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Private

588
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
DCB

589
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,576
Dln

590
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,648
Long story short like

591
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,000
The memorization is really cute to why the Snellen chart works

592
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,352
It's like what everyone is used to the old pyramid shape is like easier to memorize

593
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:21,728
The division chart presents was really interesting question about what really makes a design good cuz on the one hand

594
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
You have

595
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,848
Charts like the logmar chart like Doctor Bailey start which are standardized and precise

596
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
And it's a better

597
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,224
But a little harder to accommodate in a little harder to use

598
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
And then

599
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
On the other hand

600
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
You have the classic

601
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
Melon chart

602
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,856
What is less precise

603
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,648
Way easier to memorize

604
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,696
Which means that the more efficient test for doctors

605
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,000
Plus if it's conveniently on a wall

606
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,304
It is memorable quick easy

607
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
Imprecise

608
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:53,472
There's probably more scientific ways of measuring Vision but it's a pretty good

609
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,032
It's a pretty good way of assessing how well you can

610
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,872
Function so it's good it does work and it's a lot easier than

611
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
The other wizard

612
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,064
So you see both versions of the chart around and just next time you get your eyes checked

613
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
You can see which

614
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
Design your doctor has opted for

615
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:16,512
If you see of the traditional pyramid Snellen chart shape that means it's more efficient for the doctor to use

616
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,584
And if you see the upside down log Mar

617
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Shape

618
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,936
That means it's just a more precise tool for measuring vision

619
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
But like

620
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,752
Both are good designs

621
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
Justin really gif

622
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Waze

623
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:34,688
So we just gave the most cursory explanation of vision charts and the design implications of each of them but

624
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,504
When the whole story was with being scripted

625
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,112
It had lots of different details and it ended up getting more and more confusion about what 20/20 vision

626
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,136
Actually wasn't

627
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,928
All this weird stuff in the eventually

628
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,952
We just decided

629
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
The Killer story

630
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
And not I could produce a full version of it

631
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,352
Which is ongoing tragedy we are reminded of all the time

632
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,144
I thought that this would never really be

633
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:59,776
I researched the hell out of this I'm fertile subscribe to the Ophthalmology

634
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:04,128
National newsletter and I see this chart everywhere and it and it

635
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
Really

636
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,248
Baby pisses me off

637
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,320
I've had this day flying around forever I even made

638
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,136
I even made this really fun medley of songs

639
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Check it out

640
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:21,280
20/20 vision

641
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,384
That is the end of the mini stories

642
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,176
Happy 2017 ever

643
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,736
Normal episodes commencing next week

644
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:45,088
Let's giggling but we might try this again a couple times a year if people are into it

645
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:49,440
We had a huge response the last episode soap if you have a mini story suggestion

646
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,256
Send it our way and maybe we'll address it at the end of the year

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

655
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,464
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

656
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
If

657
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:29,888
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

658
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:33,984
All hearing. Voice

659
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,776
Technology talk to us

660
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
It is a creation of Sonic trash

661
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,896
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

663
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,528
To make them more human

664
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
Turn the living room lights on

665
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
Okay

666
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,720
Dim the living room lights to 50%

667
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
Okay

668
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,912
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

669
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,216
Makes for a much more natural

670
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Experience

671
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,776
Turn the living room lights on

672
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,128
Dim the living room lights to 50%

About how are soundscape is impacting our health

675
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,928

Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

693
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,752
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

694
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,080
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

695
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,616
We're looking the part

696
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,152
Might cost you your life

697
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:54,528
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

698
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,880
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

699
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:03,232
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

700
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,584
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

701
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,936
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

702
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
Nothing

703
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:19,360
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

704
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,688
Was found dead in my private gym

705
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:29,088
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had

706
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
Something to do with it

707
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,696
Now I need to clear my name

708
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:40,096
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

709
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:48,288
