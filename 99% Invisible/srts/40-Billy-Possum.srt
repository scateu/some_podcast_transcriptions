Hunter and his hunting trip became kind of a famous story

72
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,200
Basically it's been a few days hunting in

73
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,016
I don't think they even saw a single bear they definitely didn't get to

74
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
Shoot at any and then one morning

75
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,416
The dog is get the scent of a bear and they follow it down to this really weedy place where the

76
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,280
Presidents guide says you know what don't even bother going in there and then troubling yourself I'll go and I'll flush the beer out

You just stay here and I'll flush it right to you

So Roosevelt Waits and waits

79
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,936
But then he gets bored and decides to go off and eat lunch

80
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:58,848
Eventually the dog is to Corner the baron and the guide not really knowing what to do for scratched the bear over the head

81
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,896
With the butt of his rifle Knox

82
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,712
Unconscious or semi unconscious and tied it to a tree

83
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:10,112
And then starts blowing around reviewal trying to call Roosevelt facts that the president can be the one who has the honor of shooting

84
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,416
Roosevelt heaters Dubuque

85
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,208

It still semi-conscious

89
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
Injured it looks a little mangy

90
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:30,335
It's actually probably about half as heavy and big as it should be but there's been a real drought going on in the area

91
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
The bear look

92
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Looks pathetic

00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,223
Expedia let me decide said it's it's unsportsmanlike

95
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,063
To shoot this thing you know he's not going to do it he doesn't want anyone else to do it either

96
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623

In This Server merciful Momin

98
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,511

Draw the cartoon of the of the moment of him

100
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Showing the bear this Mercy

101
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:58,495
And the way the cartoonist draws the berries almost like a little Labrador puppy or a golden retriever

102
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
PizzaRev on it

103
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567

107
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
Staring at the

108
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
The president waiting to see

109
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
What is fate

110
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
The cartoon was called

111
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
Drawing the Line in Mississippi

112
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,183
And from that basically spawn the teddy bear this adorable little

113
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,279
Bear in the cartoon was turned into a three-dimensional plush toy

114
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,375
The very first teddy bear was either made by a German company called Steve

115
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:30,751
Aura Brooklyn toys around are depending on who you ask and they named it after Theodore Roosevelt

116
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
They called teddy bear

117
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
It's a huge sensation

118
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,151
And it's actually more popular than baby dolls worth

119
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Treats everyone out alone

120
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,503
That you know why should their children be playing with bears and and not dolls

121
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Buffalo Savage

122
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,903
And within a few years I think Steve is producing close to a million teddy bears a year and shipping them to the US

123
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
It was considered so bizarre that kids would

124
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,583
Play with a stuffed bear that people just assumed it was a novelty and as soon as Roosevelt left office

125
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
No one would want them

126
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,959
This time the whole idea of mass-produced toys was also really new

127
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,495
So the toy industry wanted to come

128
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
Capitalized on its rally in

129
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
Keep it going

130
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
It was really looking for whatever was going to be the next

131
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
Cubby play things that American Kids

132
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,455
They're going to want though though it had no idea what that might be

133
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
The best forward in 1909

134
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Roosevelt

135
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807

138
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Successor

139
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
William Howard Taft

140
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
And that January January 1909

141
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,535
Taft is in Atlanta he's trying to woo the South

142
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,631
I'll try to convince him that his administration is going to take them seriously as a

143
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
The constituency

144
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
Any suggestive on at this banquet

145
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,543
And the Chamber of Commerce in Atlanta decides it's going to serve him the truest

146
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,871
Most unpretentious Southern dish around

147
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,711
It's something that a writer of the time I found this little book about southern food from the

148
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
Calls it the Christmas goose

149
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
Epicurean nigra

150
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
The meal was possum and taters

151
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
And what it was was

152
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
An opossum

153
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,695
Would be roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes

154
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
And then presented hole on a platter

155
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
Who were the tat on

156
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
Tell on

157
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,655
And it often you'd get a smaller a little sweet potato Crown between the animals

158
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
52

159
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,287
By the way 52 has a parent leave the most teeth of any North American mammal

160
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
Which is faster

183
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
The children of the United States

184
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
It will play with Billy Paul

185
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,607
Superman on a bit of possum Mania started

186
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,703
They're Billy possum postcards Billy possum Billy possum pictures

187
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
Trader cream when you had coffee

188
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,079
There was a Ragtime tune called possum the latest craze

189
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
And

190
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
Does tap traveled around the South some people actually start giving him live opossums in cages when he would make public appearances

191
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
Handing them over like they were Floral

192
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,903
Soon baby possums were in toy stores from New York to San Francisco

193
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,255
Because real opossums when I see that comment and cities that and no one really knew what they were

194
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
A toy store in Brooklyn

195
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,119
Easter promotion with a live captive opossum

196
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
That they could show off the kids

197
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Pacific kids

198
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Familiarize themselves

199
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,007
What does new animals are going to be best friends with what

200
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,079
I found an advertisement for the story that read

201
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
Do not let it be said

202
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
Did any man woman or child in Brooklyn

203
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,479
Has not seen the cute little animal

204
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,807
Whose name is mentioned more in all parts of the world today

205
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
And any other

206
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,975
President on the newspapers

207
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:09,375
Hauser morning the passing of the dolls and and how sad it was at these teddy bears were coming into nurseries and Vanquish

208
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
And now the ra poems

209
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,215
In newspapers about Billy possums 2

210
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
Splicing teddy bears

211
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,823
But since you probably never heard of a billy possum

212
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
You can guess what comes next

213
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
It was a total flop

214
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
And the Billy possum was forgotten in almost

215
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,015
Entirely out of stores within a couple of months

216
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
What's another word for Billy possum never even made it

217
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
See Christmas time

218
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,903
Which is a special kind of tragedy

219
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,535
There are several possible explanations as to why the Billy possum never took off

220
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Converse

221
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
Probably what you thinking right now is this

222
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Opossums are ugly

223
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
And nobody likes them

224
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
But it was also the dawn of the mechanical toy

225
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,127
And even some teddy bears that evolved into wind-up animatronics

226
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
There is a French maid teddy bear

227
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:59,551
That quote wines up and is calculated to indulge in a number of ludicrous somersault

228
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
How could Olympics

229
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,135
Stuffed Billy possum compete with that

230
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,927
Pajama Willam argues that

231
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
At its heart

232
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,047
The acceptance of teddy bear and the rejection of Billy possum

233
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
Comes down to their origin story

234
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,911
In the story that was told about Roosevelt and his bear

235
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,727
It was a very kind of tender moment where

236
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
Rosella showing the bear Mercy

237
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,359
And when you looked at that cartoon the way the bear was drawn

238
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,687
It looked like something that you would want to just sweep up into your arms and

239
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,247
Take care of and that was vulnerable in that needed your help

240
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,807
It looks like a teddy bear as we know it

241
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
Although no one knew it at the time

242
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,647
The story with half we didn't give it anything else

243
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
Your top 8 is opossum for

244
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
I need a lot of it and he ate so much

245
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,607
The Doctor's first several helping is a doctor seated nearby apparently passed him a note

246
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,167
Suggesting that it might be a good idea if you slow down a little

247
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,263
Taft even bragged reporters the next day about how much opossum he consumed

248
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,335
Fly like a possum and I ate very heartily of it last night

249
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
And it did not disturb in the slightest

250
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
My digestion or my

251
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
I sleep the possum was vulnerable I guess

252
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,783
Splayed out on a bed of taters but

253
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575
You're not exactly routing for it

254
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
I started feeling really bad for

255
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
How to use the more I read a little bit about him

256
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
He was just totally colorless

257
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Politician

258
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,279
And he didn't actually even want to be

259
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
President buy some

260
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
How you assert

261
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Strong-armed into it

262
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,679
Original Annie never really measured up to Roosevelt

263
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,007
Charisma and charm mean Roosevelt was the kind of guy who

264
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,311
You no matter what he did history seem too eager to

265
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
To glorify

266
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
Case in point

267
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:32,991
The messed up thing about the famous story of Teddy the bear on that hunting trip in Mississippi

268
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
Is it isn't even the whole truth

269
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
You have to remember that Roosevelt was

270
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,927
A hunter he was there to hunt bears he wasn't a Peta activist

271
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Or something like this

272
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
Well he didn't show the bear

273
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,303
Mercy it was very particular

274
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Kind of Mercy

275
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
After he refused to shoot it

276
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,423
He said put it out of its misery

277
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
And then one of his Hunting Buddies came in

278
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
And slip the bear's neck open

279
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Man with a knife

280
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
They Carried the Bears body back

281
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
Camp over the back of a horse

282
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
And they basically ate off it

283
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
For the next several days

284
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,551
They finish it off they roasted its paws

285
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,111
And I could you not pay deposit with

Aside appassimento

287
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
So that's why you will never cuddle up

288
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
With a billy possum

289
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
Just like you will never watch a betamax tape

290
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,471
Travel to go betron with weeder one

291
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
