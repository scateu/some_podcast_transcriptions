This is 99% invisible

24
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,728
When January 3rd 1979

26
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:18,336
Two officers from the Los Angeles Police Department went to the home of Eula Mae love

27
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
39 year old

28
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,896
African American mother

29
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,736
The officers were there because of a dispute over an unpaid gas bill

30
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:30,368
We have been called we're home by the gas company because she had hit the utilities bill collector with a shovel

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,952
This is Love was overdue with her $69 payment

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
The officers approached her

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,048
In the encounter quickly turned violent

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,120
Love allegedly threatened the officers with a knife

35
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,680
They fired 12 times and killed

36
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
Her neighbors in Watts

37
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
Couldn't believe it

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,872
They could have subdued this lady without using the weapons that they used they could have took her alive

39
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
Plain and simple

40
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,456
Cuz two cops against one lady with a butcher knife

41
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,528
Neither of the two offices involved with Prosecco

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
The Killing

43
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088

Criminal justice reporter at KCRW in Los

45
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
The shooting sparked protests

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,512
I'm calls for the resignation of the chief

47
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Police

48
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
In the month

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,096
Blacks and liberals

50
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
The become intensely critical

51
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,448
Love what they charge is excessive use of force

52
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,240
By the Los Angeles Police Department

53
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:23,616
The American civil liberties union says that in the last 4 years officers here

54
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,664
Have shot over 300 people

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
Killing nearly half of it

56
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,552
Even though police shootings have been happening for years

57
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
And of course

58
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
Still happening today

59
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,184
The killing of you love received a lot of media attention

60
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,256
That put pressure on the department to respond

61
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,096
Los Angeles Board of police Commissioners recommended changes to training

62
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
And the way shootings by offices where investigate

63
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,496
In The Killing also led the department to research non-lethal weapon

64
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,616
To see if there was some alternative that might reduce the lapd's Reliance on guns

65
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
We needed to find a way to

66
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
Control people

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,248
Was there something that we could do

68
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,320
Before we had to shoot them before they had a knock

69
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
Opportunity to attack

70
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
Can you get shot that's Greg Maya

71
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
He's a retired Captain with the LAPD and in 1979 he was given the job of researching

72
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Non-lethal weapons for the

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
And what we were looking for

74
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,168
Was something that

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
Was

76
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
Effective

77
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,776
At subduing a person

78
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,824
So that they could be

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Be handcuffed

80
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,408
Expeditiously without a big fight

81
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,992
Maya and the LAPD set out to find a new tool

82
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,808
They hoped would help avoid needless deaths

83
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
Hand injuries

84
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
The police chief at the time Daryl Gates

85
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:45,024
Told the Los Angeles Times quote what we need is that thing used to see in Buck Rogers

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
Nothing uses iPhone

87
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
Resume

88
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
Nothing

89
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
Ever since the beginning of policing officers have been looking for tools to subdue people that they consider threatening

90
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
When police first started

91
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,616
Patrol the streets of America cities

92
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,152
Mini carrot sticks

93
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,944
In nineteenth-century New York

94
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,248
Cops actually had to stick to choose from

95
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
Shortest dick for the day and a longer one for the nighttime

96
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,416
Because it was thought that more dangerous criminals would come out of the dog

97
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,488
That bigger stick became known as the knights deck

98
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
It's going by other names too

99
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
Billy club

100
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
Truncheon baton

101
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,375
By the early nineteen hundreds

102
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
Lots of police departments

103
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,471
Across the country what equipping that offices with guns

104
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,799
But nightsticks remind me alternative weapon of choice

105
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,103
In the 1960s that began to change

106
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,199
It was a lot of interest in using new weapons to control large crowds of people

107
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
Many of those weapons

108
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Like tear gas

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
Came straight from the military

110
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,367
But some Police Department started using a new electrical web

111
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
The cattle prod

112
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,511
They're designed to move castle by providing a very focused

113
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
Pain on the body

114
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,839
That's dries rajabi

115
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,143
He teaches political science at Reed College

116
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,471
As written about the history of electrical weapons and torture

117
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,615
They're usually two electrodes separated by about two in and they provide a sudden sharp

118
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Blaster

119
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
A voltage which moves

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
A person

121
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,527
To comply with commands

122
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,575
Please begin to use cattle

123
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
It's against protesters during the Civil Rights Movement

124
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
In addition to attack dogs

125
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Sand fire hose

126
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
Cattle prods

127
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,791
Emerged in the hands of the Alabama

128
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Police

129
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
As early as 19

130
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
61

131
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
And by 19

132
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
64 they had B

133
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Become

134
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
Quite common and also quite

135
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Contentious

136
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
Because people objected to being treated like cattle

137
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:42,271
In 1963 a New York Times article described Alabama highway patrolman using cattle prods on a group of

138
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
American Freedom Walker

139
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
The Times Reporter

140
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
Quote

141
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
As one of the Negroes

142
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
Splinched and twisted in the grip

143
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
Of the four Troopers

144
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,791
An elderly toothless white man shouted from a roadside pasture

145
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327
Stickum again

146
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
Stickman gun

147
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
In quote

148
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
People were offended

149
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
By these stories and images

150
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,055
Proponents of electrical weapons

151
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,127
We thought they were better than bludgeoning people with sticks

152
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,175
Better of huge amounts of electricity

153
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
The Knockout blow on the head

154
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
That's Richard Doherty

155
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,855
Former deputy Police Commissioner of New York City advocating for electrical prods

156
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
On ABC in 1968

157
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
What is a knight

158
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
It's a club

159
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
It's no stick

160
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
It makes the cops

161
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,839
Look like ugly Primitives when they use the same

162
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
And it makes the people who get hit

163
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
As well as the thousand

164
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
To watch sex scenes on television

165
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,031
Hate the police more than before

166
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
Now why does this happen

167
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,871
Why in this age

168
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Science

169
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
And alleged enlighten

170
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
Dwyer police

171
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
After use a weapon that is right out of

172
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
The Stone Age

173
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,111
Is it turned out an inventor named Jack Cobra was thinking about these

174
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Questions to

175
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
Instead of a weapon from the Stone Age

176
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,231
He wanted to create one right out of the space

177
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,047
But whether it would be any more enlightened

178
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Is debatable

179
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,631
Covet work as an aerospace scientist

180
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
I have been involved with masses

181
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
Apollo program

182
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
In the late 60s

183
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
As images of protest

184
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
Police violence

185
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,079
Saturated the Nightly News

186
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
Cova came up with an idea

187
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,943
A weapon that would temporarily immobilize a person

188
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
At a distance

189
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
Using electricity

190
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,855
For several years Cova work to develop this device

191
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
And finally he created something net worth

192
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,255
He named his new invention after a science fiction novel from his childhood

193
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
It's called

194
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Tom Swift

195
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
And his electric rifle

196
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
In the book

197
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:38,495
Tom Swift Electric rifle is a lethal device the five bowls of electricity that can pass through walls and penetrate

198
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,567
Koba's electric rifle on Amazon

199
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
Was intended to be non-lethal

200
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,431
Something that could be used to incapacitate a person

201
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
Without injuring them

202
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Janine the weapon

203
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,063
Cobra took the initials from Tom Swift Electric rifle

204
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
T ser

205
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
And then he added an a

206
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,695
To make the word easier to say

207
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Taser

208
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,839
Space-age weapon does not kill

209
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
It's called a taser

210
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
It looks like a large flashlight

211
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,223
You shine the beam to light up the target pressure switch and it fires

212
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,295
Best way to use the small gunpowder charge

213
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
Defy the two metal.

214
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,647
The gunpowder it meant that some of the early tasers

215
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
What categorizes

216
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,999
Espira

217
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
Which would have to find wires

218
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:39,167
Broward County 50000 volts the time

219
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
When both darts hit a Target

220
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,567
Electricity would flow along the metal wires

221
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
What's causing the muscles

222
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,383
To tense up involuntarily

223
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,455
Bible describes hit clothing

224
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,575
And send a charger temporarily paralyzes muscles incapacitating the attacker

225
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,671
Drive right through the clothing they don't have to penetrate

226
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
The cattle prods Police Department

227
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
Had been using

228
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,327
Delivered painful jolts of electricity to make someone move

229
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
The taser on the other hand

230
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,775
Use electricity to immobilize them cover patented his weapon for immobilization and capture in Maine

231
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
1974

232
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,359
Thought about approaching police departments across the country

233
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,919
To see if they were interested in buying his invention

234
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
But he didn't get much traction

235
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
June 1st

236
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
It's important to recognize that

237
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
In its early days

238
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,623
Police were absolutely not interested in this weapon

239
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,207
They could imagine what would happen if a if

240
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
I think I believe the line was

241
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
A crazy hippie grab the end of a taser and wrap it around the neck of a policeman with all this electrical

242
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:47,775
Wire nobody wanted to go near it with a ten-foot pole so, try to find other Baez

243
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
Like Yami

244
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
But that didn't work out

245
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
He then tried the airline industry

246
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
He wanted to create a

247
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
Light

248
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,319
Device one that could be handled by a female stewardess

249
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
Incapacitated with

250
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Butera's

251
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Our hijacker

252
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
In those days

253
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:11,583
But Airlines ended up addressing their hijacking problem with the introduction of metal detectors and x-ray machines that screen passenger

254
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,143
Bears and their belongings before they got on the plane

255
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
70

256
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,471
Kovac at tweaking the design of his taser

257
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
And shopping it around to potential customers

258
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,847
But except for a handful of small police departments

259
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
You didn't have much

260
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Success

261
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
Then finally

262
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,711
In 1979

263
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Found a good man

264
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
One of the biggest police departments in the country

265
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
The LAPD

266
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,999
As it turned out the taser seem to be exactly what the department have been looking for a device the police could use to quo

267
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,143
Zap em freedom and stop them handcuffed expeditiously

268
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
Without a big fight

269
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
Since the killing of you love

270
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:54,079
Greg Meyer at the LAPD have been searching for an effective non-lethal weapon

271
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,895
Respondent looked at things like chemicals braids

272
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Bean bag rounds

273
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Sandra Bullock

274
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,015
They also looked at all kinds of contraptions

275
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Including

276
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Nets

277
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,951
And something called the action control chain that was very complicated

278
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,511
LAPD even spent a day at the Los Angeles Zoo

279
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
To see if it might be possible to use

280
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Tranquilizer.

281
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,679
They're not ready then and they're still not ready now for

282
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
For him and you

283
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Too dangerous

284
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,567
Too many too many animals die when tranquilizer guns are used

285
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
And that's when they

286
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,919
They already know the animals diet

287
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Waiting

288
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,551
Habits came along with his taser the department was intrigued

289
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,367
The first Meijer needed to see how it might work

290
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,719
My job was to figure out okay is it really a good idea does it really

291
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,535
Work in real life on the street not just enough

292
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,583
Testing environment that in

293
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,887
Real police situations out there

294
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,263
So the LAPD took the taser out onto the streets of South Los Angeles and began to test

295
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
Actually using it

296
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,615
On people they were trying to subdue and apprehend

297
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,687
A first device didn't do what the police wanted

298
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,247
And so they asked over to increase the power

299
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
Which he did

300
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
And then they took it out for more testing

301
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
And within within just six

302
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
10 days

303
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
Yeah we knew we had a winner

304
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,279
The LAPD put in an order for several hundred cases

305
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,351
And other police departments would soon follow

306
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,215
Today tasers are a huge business

307
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:29,311
Almost all tasers used by police in the US are made by one company

308
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
Taser International

309
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:35,967
Kelly by Two Brothers Rick and Tom Smith in the early 90s the company work with covert uak

310
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,759
Expand on an original invention

311
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,087
Over 80% of all law enforcement departments in the US

312
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
Now use tasers

313
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,183
When Jack Carver died in 2009

314
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
His wife told the New York Times

315
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,559
They believed his invention have saved a hundred thousand lives

316
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,399
Of course the story of tasers is way more complicated than that

317
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,495
One thing it's tough to save tasers have or have not save lives

318
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,871
Data on both police shootings and taser used are notoriously unreliable here in the US

319
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
And even if they're not designed to be lethal

320
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,247
Taser still produce an incredible amount of pain

321
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,855
I know that first-hand because it back in the summer of 2015

322
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,903
I volunteered to be tasered

323
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,975
When I get to drive for this Drive Hiram

324
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,327
I met up with two taser instructors who what for the Los Angeles sheriff's department

325
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,911
Deputy Chris aldana and Deputy Ed Clark

326
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
Most of them are being tasered

327
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
4 and they tell me

328
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,311
The only thing I have to worry about is ruining my shirt

329
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,639
It's going to get blood as getting ahold

330
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,783
Romanticizes used by the LA Sheriff's Department have changed a lot from The Middle

331
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
First developed by Jack Kirby

332
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
4 *

333
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
They look much more like guns

334
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
The one clock is holding his hand looks a bit like a pasta

335
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Sex toy gun

336
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
Black with yellow stripe on the side

337
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,887
Modern tasers also use Compressed Gas instead of gunpowder to fire

338
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,447
Which means are no longer considered firearms

339
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
The basic function has remained the same

340
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,591
When it's fired both darts have to connect with the target to form a circuit

341
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,895
Each teaser cycle typically last

342
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
5 Seconds

343
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:16,063
Thought you'd lay down right so I don't fall and hurt myself they asked me to lie down

344
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,391
As I get onto the floor if I want to be able to

345
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Tap out early

346
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,999
Meaning stop the electric shock before the 5 seconds are up

347
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
I think I might tap out then

348
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
Then I'm happy to go shorter

349
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,679
Then clock raises the weapon and points it at my back

350
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
Taser Taser Taser

351
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
I lost it

352
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
For about 2 or 3 seconds

353
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
For I had to tap out

354
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,903
More than enough time to know that I wanted to do whatever I could

355
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
To make it stop

356
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
I think what I remember most was just

357
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
Nothing else focus on anything except

358
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
The feeling

359
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,119
And my back or across my body

360
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Photos

361
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
2 seconds

362
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,983
It felt like my entire body with out of my control

363
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,799
It was the most intense pain I've ever experienced

364
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,919
After George had recovered the instructors had to pull the taser barbs out of his skin

365
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Twist and pull

366
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,527
Really the only Medical Care to be rendered is

367
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Abandoned

368
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
So it's not a it's not like a

369
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
A big hug that's going to tear a hunk of

370
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
The Flash

371
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,767
My back was sore for a few days

372
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
I took about a week

373
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
The puncture wounds to heal

374
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
But the memory of the experience

375
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Stayed with me for longer

376
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,239
I kept replaying it over and over in my head

377
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Several weeks

378
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
Soft words

379
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,591
And the fact is George had it

380
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Easy

381
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,175
Most people get tasered don't do so voluntarily

382
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
They don't have the option of

383
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Tapping out when they got enough

384
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
In the real world

385
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
Effects of taser

386
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Can be much worse

387
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,511
Texas and now referred to as

388
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
Lethal Weapon

389
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
Rather than non-lethal

390
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,911
That's an acknowledgement that any weapon can be fatal

391
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
Even a blow from A Knight's Tale

392
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Can kill someone

393
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,799
There is no use of force that is completely safe

394
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,127
According to a report by Amnesty International

395
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,431
Medical examiners have listed tasers

396
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,735
Is a cause or contributing factor

397
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
And more than 60 deaths in the United States

398
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
Between 2001

399
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
12

400
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,719
And a 2014 article in the Journal of the American Heart Association

401
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
Completed the taser could cause cardiac arrest

402
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,887
Taser International training materials Walnut its weapons can quote

403
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Cause death

404
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
The company's release statement

405
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,263
Stressing that they are quote generally safe

406
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,335
After you will love death in 1979

407
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,687
The LAPD set out to find a new weapon to reduce their Reliance on guns

408
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
And improve their relations

409
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
With the community

410
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
But it's not clear that tasers are

411
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Succeeding

412
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
Central Perk

413
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,879
Even in the majority of

414
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
This when they don't catch

415
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
A person's death

416
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,767
Do use of these weapons really drives a wedge

417
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Between

418
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
The police

419
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
And the communities that they serve

420
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
These weapons

421
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
And seeing them deployed

422
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Seems

423
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,055
On its face to be somewhat barbaric

424
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:23,455
Best Tom Nolan my name is Tom Nolan I'm an associate professor of criminology at Merrimack College in

425
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Massachusetts

426
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:30,623
27 years I was a city of Boston police officer the teaser didn't solve the problem of excessive use

427
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
Sephora store police shootings

428
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:36,767
Besides some researchers have found that cops are reaching for their taser for too quickly

429
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
Leanne too often

430
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
Situations

431
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
But don't just

432
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,911
The more weapons we have of course the police are going to use them

433
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:49,567
That mean it's it's becoming the default compliance tool and well information on taser use across the

434
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Apache

435
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,943
In several jurisdictions there's evidence that they're being used disproportionately

436
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
On people of color

437
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,039
Juveniles and people with mental health issues

438
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,135
In a 2016 Department of Justice report found in Baltimore Maryland

439
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
Police use

440
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,695
Tasers was often quote

441
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Unnecessary

442
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
And unreasonable

443
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:14,655
Additionally the Baltimore Sun found that people were sometimes being tasered for longer than the 15-second limit Taser International

444
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
National recommend

445
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,983
In one case a black man named Anthony Howard

446
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,287
Was tasered 9 times for a total of

447
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
37 sec

448
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,127
He stopped breathing and died shortly after

449
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,943
Video of the incident shows that when Howard was

450
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Tasered

451
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,503
He was standing still

452
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,783
Holding a child scooter

453
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
After he dropped the scooter and fell

454
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
Officers continued to shock

455
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,999
Places where it originally sold as a way to respond to dangerous situation

456
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
Like the kind where someone had a knife

457
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
Without having to resort to using a gun

458
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
But Nolan says

459
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
That's not how they being used

460
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,007
I think the concern that we should all have is that

461
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,615
Is that the police are using these weapons unnecessarily in situations where

462
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,967
Someone is just in as they say in the police World someone is funky attitude test

463
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:05,855
The real solution to the issue of police-community relations isn't a tool or technology

464
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,135
The alternative

465
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671
To this is to

466
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:15,071
Is to initiate institutional change and cultural subcultural change in police agencies

467
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,679
That's something that is extraordinarily difficult to undertake let alone

468
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Accomplish

469
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
Visit change we have tons

470
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
Even if it is

471
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,079
Ordinarily difficult

472
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
Because there is no match

473
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Take bullet

474
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,231
99percentinvisible was produced this week by George lavender

475
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
Delaney Hall Katie mingle and she refused

Recruit Kolstad Avery trufelman Sam Greenspan Emmett Fitzgerald Taryn Mazza and me Roman more

477
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,727

Between the beats

487
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,143
Bongs and chatter of our devices

488
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
We're immersed

489
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,727
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

490
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
If

491
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexa's talking to me and my wife isn't

492
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,991
All hearing.

493
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
Technology

494
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
You talk to us

495
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,087
It is a creation of Sonic trash

496
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,159
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

497
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,743
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

498
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
To make them more human

499
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
Turn the living room lights on

500
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,423
Okay

501
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
Dim the living room lights

502
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
50%

503
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
Okay

504
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:06,175
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

505
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,479
Makes for a much more natural

506
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
Experience

507
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,039
Turn the living room lights on

508
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,135
Dim the living room lights to 50%

509
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:23,840
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

510
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
Landscape is impacting our health

511
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,192
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

NPI phase

515
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,664
We need to talk about something

516
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,064
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet

517
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Routine

518
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

519
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:53,280
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

520
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,584
And it may be time to seek help

You can find the show enjoying discussions about the show on Facebook who tweeted me at Roman Mars in the show at 99.

Radiotopia

531
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,616
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

532
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,200
Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

533
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,992
The body genius is a dark

534
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
Comic mystery

535
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
That whines through a

536
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,344
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

537
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
We're looking the part

538
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,416
Might cost you your life

539
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:57,792
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

540
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:02,144
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

541
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,472
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

542
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
A dad

543
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,848
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

544
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:15,200
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

545
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,624
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

546
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,952
Was found dead in my private gym

547
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,280
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

548
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:33,632
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

549
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,912
Now

550
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,960
I need to clear my name

551
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:43,360
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
