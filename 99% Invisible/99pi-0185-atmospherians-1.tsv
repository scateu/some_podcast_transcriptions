EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:08,575	| 99pi-0185-atmospherians-1 |	I just want to stand up and shout know I'm unique
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:13,183	| 99pi-0185-atmospherians-1 |	I ask Brandy how she got comfortable talking so explicitly about what people look like
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:18,303	| 99pi-0185-atmospherians-1 |	It was very difficult first because I came from a human resources background and there were so many things you couldn't
