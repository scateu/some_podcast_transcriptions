EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,376	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Cul-de-sac
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:44,192	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	A lot of time there actually critiquing the suburbs more generally
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:47,776	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	The cul-de-sac has become a sort of like the mascot of the supper
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:50,336	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Mike Epps Suburbia had a flag
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:51,616	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	It would have a picture
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:52,896	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Have a cul-de-sac on it
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:59,808	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	I can still remember how strange that words sounded to me when my mom told me we were moving from the city of Atlanta
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:02,112	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	To the suburbs of Denver
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:04,416	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And that we'd be living on one of these
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:05,696	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Things
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:09,024	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Hey that's pretty sure Katie mingle do my work this week
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,840	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	The cul-de-sac is a French term literally meaning
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,120	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	The bottom of the back
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:14,656	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Or the ass of the back
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:18,496	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	So it's no wonder the French themselves prefer to use the word
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:19,008	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Empath
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:23,872	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Another fun fact the plural of cul-de-sac is actually culs-de-sac
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:27,968	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	But Katie and I have agreed that it isn't possible to refer to them this way
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:28,736	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Without
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,528	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Sounding like a couple of aspects
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:34,368	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	I've always felt a little embarrassed by my Suburban roots
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:36,672	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	By the cul-de-sac especially
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:37,440	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Which
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:39,744	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	With its uterine shape and having the words
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:40,768	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Sock in it
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:44,864	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Give me the feeling that I spent my early years coddled and sheltered
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:46,656	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	In an asphalt womb
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,936	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Living on a cul-de-sac
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,984	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Has come to symbolize
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:53,312	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Got everything that young hipsters or
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:54,848	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	People who are
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:57,920	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	I don't see Suburbia as the American dream
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:01,248	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	I've come to despise and it's taking on the symbolic role
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,016	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	That's Matt Lassiter
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,064	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And I think he just called you a hamster
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:06,624	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Yep I think you did
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:08,416	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Epitomized Suburbia both in it
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,208	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Busting the myth of the
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:14,304	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Going to happy nuclear family American dream and in the way that critics
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,096	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Condemned it as a
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:16,608	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Facade
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:19,936	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	That teaches a history of the suburbs course at the University of
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:24,032	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And the great age of the cul-de-sac is the 1950s and 1960s
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:31,200	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Matt says that by the 70s and 80s our faith in the nuclear family and in the Suburban American Dream
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,736	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Was starting to break down
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:35,552	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And it's evident all over Pop Culture
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,600	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Like in the 1980's classic
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,880	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	E t
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,416	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	At the beginning of the film
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:42,464	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	We learned that Elliott's parents are
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,512	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Divorcing his father is down in Mexico
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,280	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	The car with him
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,304	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Girlfriend
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:49,888	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Is Mom's there alone in the family sitting around the table
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:53,728	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And they're very sad
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,968	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Maybe you ought to call your father and tell him about
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:06,784	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	I can't
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,064	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	He's in Mexico with Sally
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,880	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And then et qualms
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,672	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	From outer space
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,464	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	You almost like a savior figure
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:17,024	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	To bring happiness back to this
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,303	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Sad broken
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,327	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Suburban family
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:24,191	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And I think it's really striking in the film The Way That
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,215	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Elliott can
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,775	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Confine
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,287	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Freedom
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:30,079	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And excitement
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:33,151	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	In the suburbs by riding his bicycle
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:36,479	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Note to the end of the cul-de-sac and then beyond Into the Woods
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,527	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	In the kind of magical
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,551	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Friends
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,831	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Where the subdivision
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,855	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Stops in the
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,391	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And the wilderness
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,671	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Again

EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:51,839	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Is devastating to me and I get last year's point about ET providing the escape hatch
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:57,215	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	3 horrible oppressive cul-de-sac but I also think you can't deny the fact that the kids in E.T
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:58,751	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Ruled the neighborhood
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:02,079	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	I mean the boys outmaneuver the feds on their dirt bikes
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,151	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	It's a great place
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:08,735	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	To be if your 7 years old and you want to ride your big wheel
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,271	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Out in the street
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:13,087	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	But it's not a great place to live
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:15,647	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	I would argue if you're 14 years old
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:17,439	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And want to get out of
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,463	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	The neighborhood
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:20,767	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And you don't have a car then you start feeling
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:23,327	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Trapped cul-de-sacs do tend to be iced
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,095	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Oscillating
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,887	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	They aren't connected to other streets
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,935	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And they're far away from town centers
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:32,287	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	But even though cul-de-sacs are experiencing a backlash right now
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:35,615	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	They were themselves part of a design backlash
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:39,199	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Against Urban living and the traditional grid pattern streets
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,991	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	That make up most cities
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,271	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	We think about
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:44,063	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	The cul-de-sac Bass
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,831	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Subdivision
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:46,879	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And it's obvious
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,927	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Which is the urban grid pattern
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:53,279	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	But if you go back before World War II there was a third alternative
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,327	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Which was the early Garden suburbs
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:57,375	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	That had curvilinear Street
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,679	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	But they were designed
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,471	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	The fit in with the landscape
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,519	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	To create buffers
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,543	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Between the houses
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:07,103	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	To integrate people into Park
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:07,871	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Send
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,919	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Lakes and other natural features
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,759	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And so it was the opposite of the grid pattern but it wasn't
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,039	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	The
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,855	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Cul-de-sac
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:18,367	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Bass
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:19,903	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	End of the road
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,439	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Dead end pattern
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:23,743	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Are the streets almost always came back around
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,023	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	The other Street
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,863	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	It was when the suburbs became mass-produced
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:31,167	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	The war that the worst aspects
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:33,471	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Suburban design began to dominate
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:36,543	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Little boxes on the hillside
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:42,943	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Little boxes made of ticky tacky little
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:47,551	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Whether or not you buy the idea that cul-de-sacs
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:51,391	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Psychologically oppressive or stifling to the freedom of those that live there
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:54,463	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	They have some real quantifiable design flaws
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:56,255	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Great Lake imagine me a garbage
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:57,535	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Butter or streak
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,863	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Instead of driving down one Long Street
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,911	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And collecting all the garbage from that street and then
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,191	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	I'm taking a right under the neck

EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:37,887	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	You know you were allowed to go out there all hours of the day and night and play
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,447	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Be pretty much unsupervised

EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:50,175	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	I didn't like school and I didn't fit in there but none of that seemed to matter on the cold
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:57,343	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	The cul-de-sac it was all about ghost in the graveyard and signing the guts to launch off the skateboard ramp
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,391	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And that was a world I shined in
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:02,719	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	My parents they always seem like they live there too
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,231	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Just for me
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,535	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	And after I moved away
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,071	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Eventually they did to
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:13,983	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Now my mom and dad live in a new development that urban planners would refer to as
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,751	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Mixed-use
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:18,847	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	That's shops and houses and restaurants all mixed in together

EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:04,159	| 29-Cul-de-Sac |	Going to parks with Mom and Dad doesn't sound nearly as cool as taking over an entire Street every night
