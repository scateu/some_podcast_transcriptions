EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:46,496	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	The list goes on and I've always been questions about how this immense swath of land should be used

EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:16,352	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	He says that if they just left them alone out here in the desert

EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:25,791	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Leah sottile in a 2016 I set out to write a single breaking news story about the Bundy
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:32,191	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	But one story turned into several because every time I learn something new it would just bring it
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:38,591	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	More questions things that seems unbelievable would turn out to be real even when I wasn't
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:44,991	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Writing I couldn't stop finding new pieces in this really complicated puzzle

EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:16,991	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Forget about facts and laws more than anything else the story of The Bundys is about belief
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:23,391	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Truth is figuring out which one of those things has more power if you
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:29,791	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	If you believe the Bundys then you believe the federal government is trying to enslave the American people

EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,551	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	They were done with Federal rules
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:32,671	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	We're in cattle here grazes natural resource office public land

EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:47,263	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	The bunnies have been growing melons and raising cattle on their hundred and sixty-eight
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,311	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	And for decades
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:55,199	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	The family also paid the federal government for grazing permit so they can legally Ranch on the public land

EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,671	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	The Cliven Bundy
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:08,255	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	In 1993 he started simply ignoring the ruling
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,791	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Kept his cows on the land
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:14,399	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	You should know that the rates ranchers pay for grazing are like
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:16,191	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	$1 per cow each year
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:18,751	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Ranchers by the permits because
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,031	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Land is expensive
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,335	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Majority of land in the West
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,615	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Is actually federally owned
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:28,479	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	But Aaron Wise says that's one of the things that's Up For Debate in the eyes of the Bundys
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:33,087	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Whether or not grazing your cattle on a piece of public land gives you any rights
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:33,599	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	To that proper
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:38,975	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Cliven Bundy believes he is grazing his cows on his land
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:43,327	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	And he's going to claim it's not federal government land it's actually County Land
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:49,471	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Ranchers in Clark County Nevada or eventually offered buyouts for their grazing permits

EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:06,111	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	He fought in and out of court with the Federal Bureau of Land
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,439	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	You'll hear about the Beyond a lot in this podcast
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:14,047	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Is the agency that President Truman created after World War II
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:16,863	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	To manage millions of Acres owned by the US government
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,399	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Most of it in western states
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,191	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	The bunny said
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,727	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	That was unconstitutional
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:28,639	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	If you're around the bunnies and their supporters for any amount of time will hand you a pocket-sized copy of the Constitution
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,943	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	And I'll tell you about the favorite part
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,479	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Article 1
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:32,991	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Section 8
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:39,647	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Let me read that lost to you that again this is Article 1 Section 8 Clause 17
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:46,303	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Now it starts out that says Congress shall have power to Colors called The Enclave clause
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:52,191	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	And it basically says the government needs to get State permission to use land outside of Washington DC
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:55,775	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	The bunnies claim even when they have that permission
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,823	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	The feds can only build things like forts
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,103	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Military dockyard
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:04,991	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	The problem with this interpretation is that it completely ignores the rest
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:05,759	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	The Constitution
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,831	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	There are other Clauses and long settled
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,599	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Supreme Court cases
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:12,415	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	The government definitely can own land
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:20,095	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	We'll get into that later but it's also important to know that the other ingredient here is Sovereign citizen ideology
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:24,703	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Sovereign citizens believe they are independent nations unto themselves
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:27,007	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	And when you're your own Nation
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:29,055	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	You don't have to abide by the country's laws
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:32,383	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Federal courts aren't valid federal judges
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,407	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Aren't real judges
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,431	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Things like
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,759	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Federal agencies
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,527	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Don't apply to you
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,879	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Cliven and Son Ryan
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,159	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	They flirt with these ideas
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,975	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	They don't recognize the US Justice
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,487	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	System
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:54,143	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Cars and spent two decades in court fighting over his interpretation of this clause
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,423	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Few people have even heard of
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:57,215	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	All the while
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,239	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Is cattle grazed
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:00,799	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Far far beyond his property on public land
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,847	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Which belong to everyone
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:05,919	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	The cattle grazing so far from the ranch
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:08,479	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Official surveyed his cows
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:10,271	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	They found lots of them are feral
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:13,087	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Some didn't even have a brand
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:15,391	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	They were probably born wild
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:19,999	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	These fights over endangered species in land use
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,535	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	I've been going on for a long time
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,327	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	For two decades
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,119	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Funny fart about those things in court
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,911	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	You just kept losing
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,215	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	By 2014
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:32,799	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	The government said Cliven had racked up more than a million dollars in fees
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,103	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Funny cide differently
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:40,735	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	I would be happy to pay my grazing fees if I owed old grazing fees to the proper government
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:44,575	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	That brings us to the point of who does own this land
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,879	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	How does the federal government own
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,695	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	90% of the state of Nevada
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:52,255	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	I thought we were sovereign state
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:55,327	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Buy I'm the manager of this land
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:57,119	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Because of my my ride
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:01,727	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Record says Cliven Bundy is trespassing on United States
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:02,495	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Property
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:03,519	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Just an aside
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:06,079	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Cliven often refers to himself in the third person
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:10,431	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Is this idea of trespassing that really set him off
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:14,271	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Because he was giving this interview in 2014
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,831	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Federal agents were indeed Staffing up
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:18,367	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	To take his cattle as payment
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,391	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	For his backlog of feet
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:22,207	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Who is the trespasser
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,743	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Who's the one out here with
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,303	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	200

EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:37,567	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Courts of Clark County is Cliven Bundy doing those things or is the United States government doing these days
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,615	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	That was his Breaking Point
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,919	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	He refused to give them a towels
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:44,735	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	And I have spent 20 years
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:51,647	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Legally clinically in the media and now it's time to get on the bar boots and I guess
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,671	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Lakers fan
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:58,303	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	The bunny never publicly calls for an armed standoff implies that's his only option
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:02,655	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	It seem like it's down to We the People is if we're going to get it done
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:05,215	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Building things like Malaysia
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:12,383	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	No I haven't called or anything like that but hey it looks like it's about let's go where at
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:18,783	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	By this point it was April 2014 and the Bureau of Land Management was coming to get clivens cattle off the land
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,807	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Once and for all
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:27,487	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	People from across the country with all kinds of grapes with the government it picked up in the Bundy story through right-wing media
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,815	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Many of them didn't know the first thing about raising livestock
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,863	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	They were just looking for a fight
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:40,031	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	One of them is James Yeager

EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:28,064	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Because the government is telling me to be
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:29,600	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Because they're actually violin
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:34,464	| 320_Bundyville_pt01 |	Once I make my way into the courtrooms and the trial starts
