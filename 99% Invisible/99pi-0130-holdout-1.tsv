EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:37,024	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	The city government took ownership of an apartment building belonging to a guy named David Hess
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:43,424	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	They use illegal power called eminent domain which allows governments to seize private property for public use
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:45,472	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	In this case they want to expand the subway system

EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:57,248	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And when Roman says triangle-shaped

EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,184	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	He was not amused
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:07,232	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	That's a producer Katie Mingle
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:10,816	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Later the city tried to get him to donate his pizza shaped
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:12,352	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Property so they could build
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:12,864	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Sidewalk
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:19,008	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	He refused again they build the sidewalk anyway and in the middle of the sidewalk is hess's triangle

EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:45,376	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	An eminent domain only comes into play when the government wants your property for public use
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:51,008	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	If it's a private development that wants your place and you refused to sell there's not much they can do
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:56,384	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Although there have been cases where eminent domain has been controversially used for private development
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,152	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	But that's another story
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:59,968	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	In China they call their holdout houses

EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:45,792	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Later I asked her I said what was it that made you decide to talk to me today
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,328	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And she said I like your skirt
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:50,400	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Edith macefield lived in a Seattle neighborhood
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,168	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Salt Ballard
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:57,312	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Ballard had once been its own little town until it was annexed into Seattle in 1907
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:59,104	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	To have the feel of a small town
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:02,176	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	A lot of single-family homes and small businesses
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:04,736	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	That started to change around 2005
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,016	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	When
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:09,088	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Development really started to sprout
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:12,160	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Terra Condominiums we started hearing some

EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Too quickly
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:26,751	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Ballard became so iconic of this type of Superfast high-density development that
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,543	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Hoods we call it the
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,591	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Ballard ization of my neighborhood
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:35,711	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	So in 2005 when Ballard was in the middle of bean Ballard I
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:41,343	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	A developer wanted to build a shopping center that would take up the entire block where Edith macefield have lived
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:42,879	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	The last 50 years

EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:41,151	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Proposition because
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,431	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	All she has to do is
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,223	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	You don't complain
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:47,295	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Adele somebody at the TV station or the
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	On the newspaper
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,111	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Llamacolombia
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Pretty big deal
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:55,487	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	But even though the press was clamoring to talk to mrs maysfield
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:58,303	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She wanted nothing to do with talking to them
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:01,631	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Kathy mullady had been one of the few exceptions
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:05,983	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Here's mrs. masefield turning down help from a CBS reporter as she
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	They took out some trash in her front yard
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:14,431	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	As Mrs macefield thank you very much
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,967	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Later in the segment
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:16,735	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	He knocks on our door
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,527	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And you can hear muffled
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,807	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Go away
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:23,135	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Is there any chance okay
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:26,207	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Unfortunately that muffled recording of a
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:29,023	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Cranky mrs. masefield is the only one week
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:29,535	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Define defer
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:32,351	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She passed away in 2008
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:34,143	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Which will talk about more later
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:37,471	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Love my second day there
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:40,543	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	When walking by eat his house and she was out in the front yard
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:44,127	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	With the flowers and her little dog that was blind
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	The workers started to demolish the few other building
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:53,855	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Think that we're on the Block and dig up a bunch of soil that was contaminated with lead and all the while their neighbor
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,879	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Mrs. maysfield
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,159	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Went about her business
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:59,487	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Day after day just like she'd always done
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:01,535	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Should get up in the morning and feed the
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,303	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Bert
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,071	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Anthro
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,607	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Bird seed on the sidewalk
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:07,423	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Most of the time the bridge he would be there when we got to work
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:11,007	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And if the birds eat wasn't there by 10
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,567	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	We knew something wasn't right
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,847	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	If they didn't see the birds
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:17,919	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Marywood knock on her door to see if she was okay
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,455	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And she would usually yell at
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Get the hell out of there and go away and leave her alone
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:24,831	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And I just tell her that
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,623	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Okay I'm just checking on you
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	A lot of people thought that once the construction started
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Ernest Edith macefield would fold
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:36,351	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	The noise and the encroachment on her privacy would just be too much
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:39,167	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	The Architects even designed the building in such a way
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:41,983	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	But if mrs. masefield ever decided to move
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:46,079	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	They can easily incorporate the space Warehouse was into the building
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,359	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	But she didn't fall
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:50,687	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	The developers up their offer to $1000000
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:54,015	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Plus they offered to find her a similar home somewhere else
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,807	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And pay for a home health care worker
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,087	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She turned them down
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:58,879	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Beer past
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:02,719	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	In the building around Edith macefield house got bigger and bigger
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:05,023	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	The image of it was really something
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:08,095	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Amazing pictures of the house especially if you're from Seattle
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,399	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	The building powered 40 feet above Earth
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:11,935	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Colonel house was
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,215	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Was Bohr
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,751	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Dirty well
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:18,847	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	It wasn't just a big building sitting next to a tiny house
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:24,479	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	It was a big building completely enveloping at Kani House on three signs
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:27,039	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	So close
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:31,391	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Mrs masefield could practically lean out her window and touch them
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:34,719	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	As the building moved forward the construction workers
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:39,327	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Checking in on mrs. masefield and occasionally bringing her lunch from McDonald's
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,375	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She reportedly loved
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,143	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Chicken tasty
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,959	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And Barry kept dropping off business cards
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:46,751	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Telling her to call if she needed any
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:49,311	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And then one day she
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:49,823	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	You finally did
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,871	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Said that she
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:54,687	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Didn't feel comfortable driving that day
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,735	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Could I give her a ride to go
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,271	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Get her hair done
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:02,879	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	You don't got her in the car and started driving over there and we are kind of talking about how
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,671	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Ballard was changing
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,207	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And sort of
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:10,303	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Edith macefield wasn't angry about the way Ballard was changing
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:14,399	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Cheap wasn't even angry about the mall they were building more or less
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,167	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	On top
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:15,679	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Love her house
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,727	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She said cuz it always changes
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:21,823	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	He said 20 years from now they'll be carrying this down and building something else
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,383	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She said that's just the way it goes
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,175	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	I felt like she was
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,943	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Happy that we were there
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:31,551	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She said she didn't mind the noise she said I was through World War II
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,831	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	That's Kathy Milady again
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,367	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:41,279	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She didn't mind the attention from those a young construction workers who walked by her house and the wave to her or
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,327	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Smiled or checked in a little bit
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,119	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She's been there for fifty years
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:48,447	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	That point in time know she was 86 years old
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,007	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Money didn't really mean much to her
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:51,775	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Anymore she couldn't
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,799	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Move around very well
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,359	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She knew where everything was in her house
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:56,895	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She had
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,919	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	No reason to move
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,967	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She didn't have any family
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	So
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:05,343	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Getting the money so that she could leave it for family didn't exist
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:10,975	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Mrs. maysfield didn't have any living family to leave any money to
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,255	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	By the same token
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:15,583	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She didn't have any family to help take care of her in her old age
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,631	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Pretty soon bury started
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,167	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	R2 all of her
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,471	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Lenny started making them
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:28,383	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	I got concerned that mrs. masefield who was getting more frail by the day was going to burn herself
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,407	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Under stove
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,175	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	So
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:30,687	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	I just started
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:33,759	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Swing by there after work and making her dinner
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,039	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Twink in a microwave so
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,575	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	I guess I have to
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:38,111	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Cook for social don't have to worry about it any
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:40,927	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Pretty soon Barry was making
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,719	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Her lunch and breakfast as well
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:45,279	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	One day I woke up and I'm making a free meal
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:45,791	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Today
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,351	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And then I had to come in on Saturday and
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:48,863	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Sunday
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:49,887	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Because
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,727	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Spending all this time together
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:58,847	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	He got to know mrs. masefield pretty well they listen to music together watch old movies
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,639	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Mrs. masefield also had
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,175	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Crazy stories about her past
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:05,503	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	She told me that she was a spy for the British
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,575	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	That she had been
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,599	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Captured
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,111	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Spine
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:12,159	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And they put her in decal
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:15,743	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Then she escaped from there she also said she
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:17,535	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	Taking care of a bunch of War Orphan
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:19,327	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	England after World War II
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:23,167	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	And on top of all of that she claimed to know a bunch of famous
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:23,935	| 99pi-0130-holdout-1 |	People
