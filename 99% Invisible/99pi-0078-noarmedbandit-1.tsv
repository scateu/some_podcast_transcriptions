EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:55,359	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Quickly found creative ways
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,383	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Is to add another line
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:11:03,039	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Play so usually when you see the real you can serve see the line above in the line.
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:07,647	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	The Genius of showing extra lines above and below the winning line
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:09,439	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Is that it introduces
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,975	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	The near-miss phenomenon
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:13,279	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	It's that feeling that you
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,559	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Almost one
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,607	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	When you see that winning symbol
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:19,679	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	So close on that adjacent line
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:24,031	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	But the extra lines are also available for placing extra bets
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,567	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	So the idea was
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:29,151	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Let's let people bet on three lines
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,711	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Instead of
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:33,247	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Yeah1 token they can buy
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,063	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	M-43
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:39,135	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	So you did see these early multicoin game
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:44,255	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	There was limits to them because there isn't there's really a limit when you're talking about
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:46,559	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Mechanical reels to how many
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,839	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Symbols you can fit
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:52,447	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	On the screen but then video technology came along and slot machines
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:54,239	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Could do whatever the designer one
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,799	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	So you started seeing this progression
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:59,359	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	From not just lying
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:01,151	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	You had even your
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,455	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Your two diagonals from the corners of the sea
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,223	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Screen.
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:05,759	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Then you started seeing
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:09,599	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	What's a Dexter Real let's add 5 6 7 reels
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,111	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	The cross
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,903	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	And let's add
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,439	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Zig zags
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:17,279	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	You know weird directions
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:20,095	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	So it's difficult today to see
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,375	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	25th
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:22,911	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	100 line games
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:30,591	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	And it gets so complicated it begins to get really hard to tell if you even one or not the on-screen Graphics have to draw
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,615	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	All the lines for you
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:36,479	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Some machines have even gone so far as to do away with lining up altogether
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,783	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	They have what's called scatter play
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:42,879	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	So it's really quite random you're no longer playing to line up that one
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,671	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Line of symbols across
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,207	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Which is insane
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:49,535	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	That's all going on what's going on here
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,839	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	What's significant about that
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,887	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Is this you're playing on a penny machine
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,447	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	You decide that you're going to bet
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:58,239	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Penny per line
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:01,311	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	So that's that would be 100 pennies
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,335	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	The dollar
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,103	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	In fact
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:05,151	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	You can Max it out and bat
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,431	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	3 pennies
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:06,943	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Pro-Line
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:11,039	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	So in fact you're making $3 a bat that's quite
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:14,879	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	You know when quarter players started disappearing
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,415	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	1 videos
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,183	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Came out
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,975	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Researchers were sent on to
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:25,119	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	1600 floors to find out what quarter players going are they migrating $2 as we thought they would
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:28,959	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	No they were kind of regressing back to nickel machines
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:30,495	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	But in the end they were actually
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:34,079	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	They were betting more per hand
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,103	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Then they had
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:35,615	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Quarter machine
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:41,247	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	So the question is why would a gambler do that the slots are more appealing because they take more coins
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:42,783	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Here's the real trick
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:45,343	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	When your bedding 300 pennies
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,879	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	100 line
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:49,183	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	You're going to win back
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,719	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	A portion of those
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:52,767	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	For the first time in history
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:56,863	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	You're not betting a token and then losing it all
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,655	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Ore doubling at AAA
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,959	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	That's a really volatile set up
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:06,335	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	This is much less volatile you're spreading your bed across a hundred lines
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:09,663	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	It's really a lot safer if you want to see it that way
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:13,503	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Because chances are you're going to win back something on some of those lines
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:17,087	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	And it just so happens that these machines are designed
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,879	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	When you win back
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,391	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Something
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:23,743	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	To give you all the winning stimuli that comes along with a real win
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:27,071	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	One researcher has aptly called this
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,607	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	A false twin
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:33,983	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Or losses disguised as wins
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:36,799	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Quote-unquote winning 9
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,847	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	That's a pretty radical
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:39,615	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Net loss
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,407	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	But yet
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:43,711	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	There's little videos that are being played
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:46,015	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	It's virtually no difference
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:47,039	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Then when you really do
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:52,159	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Another key factor in making Penny machines possible
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,695	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	And all their little micro bats
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:57,535	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Are updates and how the player feeds money into the machine
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,583	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Yeah this is a huge
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,351	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Part of it
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:03,935	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Alongside the ergonomics of the chairs and the
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,215	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Changes in the
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:07,775	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Responsibilities of the buttons and how they're placed
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,591	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	The financial access

EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,919	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	If you think about the past
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:18,271	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	If you ran out of money and you wanted to continue to play at a machine
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:21,855	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	There was a lot of steps you had to you really had to work for it
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:25,183	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	You had to leave your machine maybe wouldn't be there when you got back
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,207	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Someone to hold it
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:29,023	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Search
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:33,375	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Get some cash had to search out a cashier's cage or
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,911	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	A roving chained attendance
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:41,823	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Buy these coins return to a machine open the coins and put them in one by one that was very low
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,335	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Labor intense
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:45,151	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	And then imagine feeding in 300 pennies
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,503	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	What would take
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:53,343	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	22 credit play bill acceptors
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:56,159	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Are you got these little digital monitors where
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:16:00,767	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	It wasn't exactly telling you how much money was in the machine it was telling you how many credit
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:05,631	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	So already there with Bill acceptors you saw it kind of turned toward
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,911	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Credit play with
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:09,471	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Really dematerialize the money
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:12,031	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	Made it less real somehow and allowed you to

EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:51,199	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	And player cards
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:55,039	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	We're really necessary piece of the technological puzzle

EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,343	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	To come on the scene
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,391	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	With multi-line
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:07,583	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	And this design evolution is the reason why slot machines are the most profitable form of gambling even though there is no
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,095	| 99pi-0078-noarmedbandit-1 |	What's going bald
