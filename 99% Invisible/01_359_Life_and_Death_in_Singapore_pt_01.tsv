EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:04,895	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	These were huge cultural changes
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,687	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Not everyone was happy
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:10,527	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But after the war in the nation's Independence a lot of singaporeans
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,831	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	We're willing to make sacrifice

EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,815	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Also I kind of had to go along with the changes
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,887	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Singapore has really limited freedom of speech
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:29,215	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	So when the government tells you to do something you don't have much choice
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:32,031	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	In 1978
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,055	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	It happened
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:37,407	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	The pet sensing Cemetery Association received a letter from the government
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:38,431	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Saying a new

EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,551	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Their land was being rude
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:47,903	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Remember they're basically two groups of people at Exxon thing
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:49,439	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	The dead and the living
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,975	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And both were told that
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,255	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Add four years to clear out
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:57,631	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	The people living in Pakistan think we're mostly relocated into new government housing nearby
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:59,167	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But it took a while
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,983	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	A lot of the villagers weren't happy to leave
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:04,543	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And they stayed as long as they possibly could
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:07,359	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Sometimes a year is past the deadline the government gave them
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,127	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	To move
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,407	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	As for the Dead

EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,063	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Association wanted to find a way to
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,855	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	The keep a piece of their land
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:19,135	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But no the longest
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:20,415	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Prettiest
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,743	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	No more land area means no more

EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,559	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	So that was it
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:28,095	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	So they hired a lawyer
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:30,399	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And pleaded with the government to let them keep just

EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,799	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Enough to have a temple and some administrative buildings
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,567	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And to cremate
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,103	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And build a columbarium

EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,959	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	At least there would be room for a columbarium
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:05,983	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	A couple of other buildings
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:10,079	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Still a hundred thousand bodies would have to be dug up from the cemetery

EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:58,976	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	So many other cemeteries were cleared for development and it still going on
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,000	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Right now
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:05,888	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Losing the cemeteries has forced a total one-eighty and how a lot of singaporeans think about dying
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:09,472	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	The first government crematorium opened in the early

EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:16,384	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Now more than 80% of singaporeans are cremated when they die
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:19,712	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Substantially more than the US where that number is just over
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:24,064	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	50% and all of those Traditions that people like Mystic wanted
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,880	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Burning offerings at having a feast at the grave
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:29,184	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	It had to be way down size
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:29,952	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Lights to fit into the
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:31,232	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	The tight hallways
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,000	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	The columbarium
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:36,096	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Today Singapore has for government-run columbarium

EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:55,552	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But most of the country's large male Community practices Islam which doesn't permit cremation
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:25:00,672	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	So in 2007 the Singapore government implemented their new Crypt

EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:07,072	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Like a deathly grid

EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:12,448	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But you only get 15 years in your own grave
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:14,496	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Now you have to be consolidated

EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:25,760	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But there was also a widespread understanding
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:31,136	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But something had to give in order to get so many people their own homes

EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:48,288	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	In my opinion
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,824	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Must be sacrificed
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:54,176	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And the Singaporean people did sacrifice
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,224	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Not just the land
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:26:00,064	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But centuries of rituals and traditions for their debt

EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:20,544	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	This cultural shift happen without a lot of resistance from the Singaporean people
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:21,824	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But that is changing
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:24,640	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	I will talk to Katie Thornton about that

EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,816	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Today there's a lot of infrastructure for

EDL	00:26:56,896	00:27:01,760	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Yeah totally so like there's one other Cemetery that has actually been getting a lot of
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,528	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Attention lately
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:06,368	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	It's called bukit Brown and it's another Chinese Cemetery
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:11,744	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	A lot of prominent early Chinese Singaporean businesspeople and philanthropist are buried at bukit Brown
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,536	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	There are a ton of those
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:16,352	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Cornet tombstones like the one with the Quan describe
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:17,888	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	At the site
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,680	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	What are you going to do about those
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:22,240	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Well in 2011
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:24,032	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	The government announced that they're going to
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,312	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Expand a highway
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:30,688	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Right through the cemetery and that Highway opened earlier this year
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:35,552	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	They had to remove 4000 Graves and a lot of the Tombstones were thrown away
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:40,672	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And just like that text something the government said that they had to come and clear out the graves
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:42,720	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Or the remains will be scattered at sea
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:48,096	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Pretty upset like at this point is one of the only remaining cemeteries
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:48,864	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Indian Tire
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:55,264	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Country bunch of volunteers story instead of advocating for the preservation of the society leading tours and academics.
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:57,056	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Involves and documenting the space
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,616	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And it really spoke to people like
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,152	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Grumman do you remember Hoon
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,200	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Yes she was the
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:05,248	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	The person that was in the peace that
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:08,320	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Was historian but she saw ghosts when she was a
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,088	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	The kid
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:11,136	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Yeah totally would she just mentioned
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:16,512	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Lake very casually
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:19,840	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	She had this job at the time she's working for a theater company and choose
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:21,376	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	He's doing a lot of traveling around
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:24,448	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And sometimes when she was traveling should go and visit big like
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:27,520	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Famous Destination type of cemetery
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:31,104	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Eminem Road was announced she was like Hey I've never been to poop
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:34,432	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Brown maybe I'll check it out I mean it's my own backyard
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:36,736	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And then she went and it was like
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:37,504	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Cut
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:38,784	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Scene change
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:41,088	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	She totally changed her career
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,904	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And why was this the thing that really really
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:46,720	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Mater want to change everything what is she
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:47,232	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Care so much
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:51,584	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	For some reason it just didn't really sit well with her that people who never play
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:56,192	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Planned on being cremated and thrown into the sea might end up there
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:29:00,288	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	So she just wanted families to know if they had ancestors buried at 3
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:06,432	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Because a lot of people had lost track so she quit her job and she put together all these family trees
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:07,712	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Menchie's
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:09,248	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Cold call The Descendants
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:14,880	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And tell them that a grave of say their great-grandmother was going to be dug up
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:19,232	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Remember Graves where she was like so sure that you could find The Descendants
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:25,120	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But you would talk to the government and be like please wait wait like don't think up this tomb yet I can find the family
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:29,472	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And then she would and should stay in touch with them and help them throughout
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:30,752	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	The whole process
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:33,056	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Stand alongside the family is us
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:33,824	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	They dug the body
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:35,360	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	He's up and move them elsewhere
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:37,664	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And she still doing it
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:39,968	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Even after the road opened earlier this year
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:42,528	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	She's still working to document the space
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:46,112	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	She's been living off her savings for 8 years to do the work
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:49,184	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Because she's worried that the rest of the cemetery is going to be developed
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:51,232	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And also history will be lost
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:54,560	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But she does think that there was
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:56,864	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	A time where maybe it made
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:30:00,704	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Sense to develop over these faces to get living people's needs Med
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,472	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:03,520	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	The times a little bit different now
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:06,336	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Like I asked her I asked you in about text hunting
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:08,640	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	And I'll tell you a little bit of tape about what she said
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:12,480	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Yeah at the point at that point I'm definitely I mean
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:14,016	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Uuuuu
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:15,552	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Go for
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:18,368	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Having high rise building to house.
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:20,160	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	People rather than to have
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:21,440	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Cemetery for the Dead
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:25,280	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Yes I'd like at that time she definitely saw it as
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:28,864	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	FedEx change indirect exchange between the living and the dead
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,400	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But you feel like times are kind of
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:32,704	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Different now like men might be possible to
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:33,472	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Preserve
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:36,288	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	View old spaces on the island
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:38,848	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	So again like this is what she said about that
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:41,152	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	There was a need for it before
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:43,200	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Is test you that need now
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:47,296	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	You know so it's like it is like
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:49,088	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	If this is gone and erase
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:52,928	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Not replaceable and irreversible
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:56,512	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	We are talking about retaining a part of our heritage
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:57,792	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	You know
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,840	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Did your opinion
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:00,352	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	About
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:02,656	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	The role of cemeteries
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,680	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	In life change
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:11,104	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	I think that cemeteries are these interesting and complicated historic sites there
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:12,896	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Kind of an opportunity
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:13,408	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	4
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:15,712	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	People to inscribe
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:21,856	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Their history on the landscape there's certainly like Rife with exclusions as well
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:24,160	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	People that excluded from Cemetery spaces
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:26,720	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Based on their race based on their religion
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:29,280	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Based on their class and their inability to access
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:30,560	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Sammy like a large
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,328	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Tombstone
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:32,352	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	But I think it's
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:35,680	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	They also present kind of an interesting opportunity to
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,728	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	Complicated history because they're kind of
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:42,592	| 01_359_Life_and_Death_in_Singapore_pt_01 |	More accessible archives than a lot of our historic archives
