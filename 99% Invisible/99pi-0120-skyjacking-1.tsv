EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:02,911	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	But clearly something had to be done
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	If the airlines were unwilling to consider a mandatory screening and checkpoints inside the terminal

EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,663	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Had to be considered
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:17,759	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	So in 1968 the FAA created a special anti-hijacking

EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:27,999	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Invited to the public to submit suggestions about how this could be done
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:31,839	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	The most common suggestion was complete capitulation
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,607	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Quote

EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:53,599	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	So you kind of just fly them out over the water and then turn back and

EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,183	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	The big idea
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:01,535	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Try not to be too expensive that it would have cost prohibitive so they couldn't do that solution
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:07,935	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	But there were also a lot of delightful Technical Solutions whose patents

EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:15,871	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	There was also one patent for an injector seat
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,407	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Which would have a quote

EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:56,319	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Country would go out with oxygen tanks and disarm the hijacker
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:09:02,463	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	One that I loved actually was giving all the passengers boxing gloves and making them wear boxing gloves the duration of the

EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:13,727	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Of course then there would be an epidemic of extremely ill-advised boxing matches at 30,000 ft
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:18,335	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	But the real thing at the end up going with
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,359	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Was this
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,383	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Behavioral
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:22,687	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Profile now sure the one thing about
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,735	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Cathay Airline terminal there was one
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,527	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Place you had to halt
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,807	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	General in that was a ticket age
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,855	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	She get a boarding pass or to purchase
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,367	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Is a ticket
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,903	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	There are many more tickets
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,671	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Purchase on site
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,975	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	So this is the one choke point
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:37,023	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	In the terminal experience
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,863	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	TFA solution was to train a ticket agent
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,655	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	In this
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,447	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	25 Behavioral
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,471	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Cues that might indicate

EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,263	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Is a temple Skyjack
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:51,359	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	These were things like not maintaining appropriate eye contact
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,151	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Not caring about your luggage
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:55,455	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Wearing Military Surplus Gear
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,735	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	And if you saw any of the
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Traits
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,783	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Behavioral traits
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,319	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	A customer
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,111	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Through to get a ticket or boarding pass
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:09,023	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	You would Dre discreetly are asked if they go to a room on the side and be searched
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,303	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	This was not a good solution
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:14,143	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	And the real problem is that ticket agent or not security personnel
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,423	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	They're dealing with
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,191	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Hundred
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:16,703	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Hundred
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:17,727	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Hundreds of
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,287	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Often very harried customers
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:20,799	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Per day
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,615	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	And so they're not the people truly identify
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,943	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Even if you assume these behavioral Q-tip off
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:32,575	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Work and it turned out to be a bad assumption because plenty of skyjackers pass-through without notice
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:37,183	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	He was meant to be very low impact solution at the one show point that already existed in Arabic
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:38,719	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Was really a failure
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:46,143	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	But the solution that we all know that eventually came up with screaming everybody and their luggage with x-ray machines
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:48,447	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Requiring ID all the things that make

EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,663	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	This is a really forgotten
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,943	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Really pivotal moment

EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:04,831	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Kind of tail end of this
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,927	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Really crazy hijackings went after the neck
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,695	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	People asking for
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,719	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Huge amounts of money
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:14,303	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Then you have these Three Fugitives

EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:22,495	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	They had a grievance of the Detroit police
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,263	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	And they wanted

EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,359	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	And they said they didn't get it
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,151	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	They were going to crash.

EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:45,535	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	All the sudden everyone realized an airplane could be a weapon of mass destruction in this case threatening to turn East

EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,375	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	And that's really when the light goes on
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:51,935	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	For the Airlines and the government
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:54,495	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	That the current situation is no longer tenable
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,775	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Fortunately they escaped

EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,647	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	And they bring on a 50 pound of cash
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,671	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	A lot of money in there
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:15,231	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	I think it's $10 and so they actually didn't bother to count it
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:19,839	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Who is taking forever to count that much money anyway who never takes them into consideration

EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,799	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Shortly after that you have the

EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:41,343	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	The airline's really wanted the government
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:43,903	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Provide airport security for the government reviews
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:50,815	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	And the airlines hired contractors to do airport screenings and run the metal detectors at the airlines desk
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,095	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	Really trying to avoid
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:55,935	| 99pi-0120-skyjacking-1 |	And they put them in Jericho 1973 and there's literally not
