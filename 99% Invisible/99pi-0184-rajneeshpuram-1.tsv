EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:38,847	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And they were quite pleasant but they definitely word from around there
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:41,919	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	They were all dressed in red badge strange names
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:46,527	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	At one point in the conversation Doro asked if they were a religious organization
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:49,599	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And the answer was so no absolutely not
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:53,951	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	We're not a religion we have members who are a ball face
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:58,815	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And we just Celebrate life and laughter and
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:01,119	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And happiness and we're just simple farmers
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:02,655	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Well
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:04,959	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	That wasn't the case and that wasn't
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,007	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	1st and 10th
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:14,687	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Duro didn't know it yet but the intent of his visitors was to build a mecca for the gurus followers from a
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,455	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Across the globe
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,527	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	In order to build anything
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:20,831	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Bassani assassins would have to get permits
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:23,135	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	For every single structure that went up
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,671	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	A mistake I think that
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:30,303	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	They made ultimately was to not look at the land use laws of Oregon
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,839	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Versus other states
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:35,935	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Listen to chose Amazon specifically for farming
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:39,775	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And they weren't going to be able to get permits for buildings that weren't performing
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,079	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	But there was a workaround
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:48,735	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	According to state law if they became their own City they could have their own planning office and issue their own purse
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:52,319	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Effectively skirting County oversight and
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,599	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	The land use laws
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:58,975	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	In Oregon at the time to incorporate a city all you needed was 150 people
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,511	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Which was easy for the sannyasa
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	There really wasn't much to decide
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:07,423	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Once I met the basic requirements for incorporation that did move forward
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:11,007	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Johnson's name their new city after the guru
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,799	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Bhagwan shree rajneesh
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,567	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	They called it
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,103	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Rajneeshpuram
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,943	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	It seemed like it happened very quickly
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	That building started springing up
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:22,783	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:26,367	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Garden started being planted houses
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	They scratched out a runway for
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,231	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	An Airfield
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,279	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And they brought in
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,303	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Planes
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:38,399	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	The city needed infrastructure to support not just the full-time residents
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,679	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	But visitors to
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:44,031	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Every summer thousands of disciples came for rajneesh's Annual Festival
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,055	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	In the off-season
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:48,383	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	People came to take meditation courses and experience life
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,151	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	In the city
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	They built a strip mall and a hotel buildings for religious ceremonies
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,039	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	A crematorium
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,087	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	A discoteca post office
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:59,647	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Many of the buildings were designed in a rustic
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Alpine Style with wooden siding
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Housing on the other hand was built quickly
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:08,607	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	With lots of prefab a frame structures littered across the valley
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:12,447	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	It was amazing at what they were doing and they were doing it very very quickly
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:17,567	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	But the rent is rapid expansion did not go unchecked
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Immediately after rajneeshpuram became an official city in Oregon Environmental Group challenged in court
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,735	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Operation
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:25,759	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Basa
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:26,527	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	The
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,551	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Attempt
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:30,111	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	To build a big city out in the desert
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:30,879	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Which was
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,695	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Agriculture
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:36,511	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	As a huge problem
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,303	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	For the land use laws
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:43,167	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	A judge ruled that the sannyasins could keep building there
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,471	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Despite the pending lawsuit
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,239	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	But he won them
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:50,079	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	If the environmentalists won their case against rajneeshpuram
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,871	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Almost everything they built
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:52,639	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Would have to come down
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:59,295	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Sonia Austin's were undaunted they work 16-hour day 6 days a week building up their City
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:01,343	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Here's ma Anand Espirito again
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,391	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And so we would work
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:05,951	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	All day and usually that would go until midnight
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,767	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And then go to bed
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:13,375	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Maybe have a lover and make love all night and then get up again
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,679	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	The morning and start over
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:20,543	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Rajneesh taught his followers that meditation was the highest form of worship
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And that work
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,359	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Would be there meditation
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:26,175	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	A doctrine of Relentless work is
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:28,479	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Pretty convenient when you're trying to erect
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,503	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	A city from scratch
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:33,343	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Of course all that construction cost a lot of money
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:37,183	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Luckily rajneesh had a Global Network of lucrative communes
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,231	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	That sent the revenue to rajneeshpuram
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:42,559	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Plus the guru's followers surrendered everything
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,583	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Sing from their former lives
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,655	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	They sold their jewelry their cars their homes
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,191	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And give it to the city
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,287	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	The ranch was changing fast
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:56,127	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Listen to ride in 1981 but by 1983
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:11:02,015	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	They build 140 small dams up and down the John Day River to slow the rate of a rodent
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,039	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And it work
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,855	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	The dusty Golden Valley was Green
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:08,415	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	We had an amazing organic
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:08,927	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Farm
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,207	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	I was
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:13,279	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Very very nutritious vegetables
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:18,911	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Within the first couple years the population jumped from a few hundred people to around 2,000
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:22,239	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And their Farms produced almost everything they needed
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:25,823	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	They also accomplish some pretty impressive Feats of engineering
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:31,199	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Rebuild a 45-acre reservoir held by a 400-foot Earthen Dam
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:37,087	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Not to mention a mass transit system composed of 85 school buses that zigzag around Rodney Parham
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,671	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	But while the citizens got around in school buses
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,695	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	The guru
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:43,487	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Preferred a Rolls-Royce
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,255	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	In fact
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:46,559	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	She owned 93 Rolls Royce
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:51,679	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And everyday in a kind of ritual he drive around the city in one of them
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:54,239	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Noon and then again like a
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,007	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	5
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:58,847	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	He would drive the roads and people the sannyasins would line up along the road
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,895	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Hands clasped
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,431	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	In front of their faces
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:07,551	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Sort of being blissed-out as he went by and tears streaming down their face
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:14,463	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Writer of the time he moved to America the group began about silence
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:19,327	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	To be so cold drive-bys were one of the ways that rajneesh communicated with his followers
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:26,495	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	But it seems like he also just really like the feel of the open road and then he would hit the highway and he wouldn't
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:30,079	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Drive a hundred miles an hour I don't know how many tickets he got
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,847	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	How many
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:31,871	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Times he was
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:32,639	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Threatened
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:34,175	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Have his license taken away but
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,991	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Evidently was a lot
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:40,319	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	While rajneesh was in silence he set up a government for the ranch
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:43,391	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	An elite Inner Circle of female senior
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:49,791	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	He wanted to come in to be a matriarchate because he believed that women were less dominated by their egos
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:53,119	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	At the center of the circle was a woman named ma Anand Sheela
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,447	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Sheila was rajneesh's secretary and chief spokes
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:01,055	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	She was one of the only people he spoke to during his long silence
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:04,127	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	Here's archival tape of ma Anand Sheela
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,431	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	My purpose is

EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:26,847	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And then in a final desperate move the leadership of rajneeshpuram devised an insane plan
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:29,663	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	To prevent the rest of the county from voting

EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:45,023	| 99pi-0184-rajneeshpuram-1 |	And when they went to the salad bar they would like
