EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:38,048	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	A picture of a couple of times
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:41,376	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Imaginary worlds has a very special place in my heart because
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:43,680	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It is the podcast I listen to the most
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:45,728	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	With my boys Maslow and Carver
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:50,336	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Because it covers all the sci-fi and fantasy subjects that they love like

EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,528	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's about those things
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:03,904	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But it's really about who we are as humans through these worlds that we create and share
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:08,000	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	How early this year imaginary world produced the story about the thing that is most

EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:12,096	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And that's the card game
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,632	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Magic the Gathering
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:19,264	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I just called Magic a card game but if you spent any time around someone who loves magic you know
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:22,592	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It is way more than a guard game it is a way of life
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:25,408	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I'm pretty sure it rewired my son's brains
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:32,320	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I wanted to cover Magic on 99 Pi for a while now but Eric did such a great job with it it made more sense to share his

EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:46,656	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	IMac Gilinsky
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,448	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And this is not
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,264	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	My name is
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:58,176	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Nat is teaching me how to play Magic the Gathering at the Brooklyn strategist which is the same game shop
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:00,480	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Copperline play Dungeons & Dragons Fierce ago
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:03,552	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	What were DND is role playing game
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,856	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Magic is very much a card game
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:08,928	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And by the way magic is the shorthand that most people called Magic
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,512	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Mostly call it magic in this episode
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:16,352	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Simplest level there are two basic types of cards in magic
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,448	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Enterprise magic is like any card game
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:23,776	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	You need a combination of luck and skill to win
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:25,568	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And it's usually played with just two people
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,872	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But it is not a generic
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,384	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Deck of cards
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,432	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Each of the cards
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,456	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The creature
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,736	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Or spell
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:36,576	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Or magical artifact on it that you can use to attack your opponent
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:40,416	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And some cards represent the source of your magic which our lands
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:46,304	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The more land cards that you have the more magic you can wield against the person sitting across from you
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,840	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And your goal
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:50,144	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's a knock your opponent from 20 points
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:50,912	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	20 points
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:52,448	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Danceable
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:53,984	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's not
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:57,312	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's really really not
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:02,432	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	So when you play you always have 7 cards in your hand that you're taking from a deck of 60 card
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:06,784	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But that deck of 60 cards or something that you custom make
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,600	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Because the company that makes Magic the Gathering
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,624	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Wizards of the Coast
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:12,928	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Has put out over 10
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:15,488	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Thousand possible cards to choose from
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,280	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Over the last quarter-century
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:22,399	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And there is a central mythology that unites those thousands and thousands of car
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:25,727	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Because Magic the Gathering takes place in a Multiverse
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,775	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And some of the cards represent
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:32,895	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Plane Walker's the main characters of the game can jump from one parallel universe to another
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,479	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	No I always do that magic the Gathering
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:36,991	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Was huge
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,527	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:41,599	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I had never done an episode about it because I was kind of intimidated
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:45,439	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Like when I used to go to the Brooklyn strategist to play D&D
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:50,047	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	We'd all be role-playing are characters like we're in some kind of medieval improv troupe
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:54,143	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And then I look at the table where these people playing Magic the Gathering
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,447	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And it was like they were speaking a whole other language
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:00,799	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Now this year is the 25th anniversary of Magic the Gathering
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:04,639	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And it amazes me the game is still so popular
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:11,295	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Notice anything wrong with a game itself but he was developed by this mathematician named Richard Garfield in the early 90s
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:13,599	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	There's very little competition from video games
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:18,719	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And now so many analog games and toys that used to be pretty solid
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:23,071	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Are struggling to compete against PlayStations and iPad apps
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,119	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	In Magic does have an app
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:28,703	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But the handheld card game is still the main focus
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:35,871	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And they are not struggling to compete I mean magic the Gathering has been on an epic run each year is more Pro
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,639	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Profitable than the last
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:40,223	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Soy two questions about the game I was really curious about
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:45,087	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	First why has it survived the onslaught of Digital entertainment
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,135	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And secondly
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:50,719	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	How do you create a sense of story and World building
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,023	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Hidden non-sequential card game
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:57,631	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Indus all that mythology in world-building make for better card game
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:01,471	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Or is it something the players ignore when they just focus on winning
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:05,055	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Well to answer those questions
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:05,567	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I went
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,359	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Straight to the top
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:10,431	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The head designer for Magic the Gathering
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,223	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Mark rosewater
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,807	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I'm pulling out of driveway we all know what that mean
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,343	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's time for the drive to work
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:24,511	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Okay by the way that is how he starts every episode of his podcast as he drives to the office outside Seattle
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,303	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Talking about different aspects of the game
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,095	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	He doesn't get to a podcast
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:32,703	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Mark is out there on every media platform talking about magic
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:34,239	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Answering questions from players
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:37,055	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	He is a force of personality
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,871	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Demarcus been with a companies
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:40,383	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Mid 90
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:43,455	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Just a few years after Magic the Gathering came out
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:47,551	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And I have to say in all of my years of interviewing people
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,831	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I don't think I've ever met anybody
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:53,183	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Whoso unabashedly loves their job
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,719	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	As much as Mark does
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:07:00,863	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	My job is to come up with a really cool things that will make players really really excited
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:03,167	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And then I could not talk about it for
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,447	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	16
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,983	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	24 month usually
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,519	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Example
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:10,591	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Last December we put out a particle unstable
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:13,151	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Which is kind of like a humorous take on Magic
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:16,479	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I've been working on this project for 7 years
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,527	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And I did not talk about it
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:24,671	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	First seven years at the one I finally got to talk about people like while you're so excited I'm like
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:26,975	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I've been waiting to talk about it for 7
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:34,655	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Now what are the reasons why magic has stayed popular all these years is because the game never stops evolving
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,983	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	As I mentioned earlier the premise of the game
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:40,543	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Is a 30 parallel universes called planes
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:47,199	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	In the frequency in which Wizards of the Coast has introduced new plants gone from every couple years to every year
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,503	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Denounce sometimes twice a year
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:56,415	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And you know in the beginning magic was relying and all the standard fantasy tropes that you would see in a game like Dungeons & Drag
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:08:02,047	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But is it kept introducing New World more and more quickly they kind of ran out of those fantasy tropes
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:07,167	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	They've also had to be more creative in terms of what they bring into the fantasy genre
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,983	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Like in one of these parallel universes
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,007	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Everything's made of metal
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:16,127	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Or another one of these parallel planes is like a steampunk version of India
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,431	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But as Mark says
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,735	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Set of cards
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:23,039	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's a very challenging way to tell a story
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:26,367	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Not everybody sees every card and they don't see them in the same order
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:30,463	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	So what we've done is we tend to use our cards
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:32,255	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	To build the environment
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,535	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	To build the world
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,071	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The Flash out the world
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,863	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And kids at the story
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,911	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And then we tend to tell the story through other means
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:45,311	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Like on the magic the Gathering website there's a lot of extra material explaining what is going on in these different worlds
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:48,127	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But eventually they decided to up the ante
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,663	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	On the design of the cards
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,199	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	So when you encounter a new deck
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:53,759	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	You automatically feel something
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:54,527	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	About this world
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,087	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Without having to read the backstory behind it
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:01,695	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	We want to figure out what the emotional core of the experience is going to be
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:06,303	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The mechanics aren't just about doing something throat making you feel something
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:08,351	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And I really got into the idea of
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:13,727	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	We're going to go to a Gothic horror world and we're going to make you afraid cuz it's a Gothic horror world
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:20,127	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Are we going to go to our Greek mythology world and you're going to be a hero and goat adventures and mix
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:20,895	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Something of yourself
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:26,015	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Now there are three basic elements each card
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,551	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	First
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,319	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	There's an illustration
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,367	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Which is about 2 by 2 in
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:32,415	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But there's so much drama
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:35,231	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	In the story going on in those little paintings
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:38,303	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Men looking at them I get sucked in like it's a movie
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:41,887	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The second element every card is the statistics
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,167	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	How old is creature
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,191	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Spell
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:46,495	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Artifact will function as a card
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,543	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Didn't realize
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:51,359	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	How many different ways a card could behave in a game
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:56,479	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I mean it is endless in terms of how many points you gain or take away from your opponent
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:10:02,111	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Whether this card is better used on the offensive or the defensive how many times you can use the card
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,415	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And the game mechanics aren't random
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:07,487	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	They reflect the personality of what's on the card
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:11,839	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	In the third major element debit card is something called
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,351	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Flavor Tech
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,911	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	A few lines of
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,191	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Poetic description
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:20,031	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But even the flavor text got more ambitious over the years
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:23,359	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	How many words that can cram into a card
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,407	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But how succinctly
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:27,711	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I can paint a picture of a broad story
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,503	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Beyond that one card
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:34,367	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Back when I used to write flavor text one of the things was it was a lot like poetry
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,903	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It was a lot like
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:39,487	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	How can I convey as much as possible in the smallest amount of space
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,791	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And one of my favorite pizza flavor tax
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:44,863	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	There's a card at insect called
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,655	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	We went with I SeaWorld
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,935	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Apple Ice Age
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,727	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And there's a cardinal called lord wife
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,775	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Which was this horrible monster
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,543	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Abase
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:55,871	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Loosely based on some North stuff the flavor text on it was
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,455	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Hans run it's the little boy
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:02,271	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Last words of saffi eriksdotter
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,599	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And somehow just like this idea that
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:12,255	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Did poor of this poor woman that like the last thing we learn about her is she scared to death cuz she knows how horror
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,815	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And she is right
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,583	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Because
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,119	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	That's the last thing she ever says
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:25,055	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And as much as Mark loves to talk about the game there's one aspect that he's actually the most
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,079	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Passionate about
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,383	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's called the color pie
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:34,527	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And when I first read about the color pie just seem like that of an esoteric part of the whole game mechanics
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,831	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But then I realized
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,623	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It is the lifeblood of the game
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:42,975	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It is the thing that makes you feel like you're actually wielding Magic
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,999	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	You play with the car
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:46,303	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Because all of the cards
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,839	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The Gathering
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,887	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Are divided into five colors
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,935	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Card reader White
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:52,703	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Black
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,471	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Blue
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,495	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Red or green
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:58,335	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	In each color represents a different philosophy of magic
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,383	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	To white magic
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,407	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's about control
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:02,687	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Order
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,479	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And whatever works for the collective good
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:08,319	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Blackmagic promotes ruthless individualism
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,367	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Red magic is fiery and passionate
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,671	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Blue Magic is brainy
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,439	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Intellectual
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,231	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Green Magic
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:16,255	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Is in harmony with nature
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,327	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	One of the neat things about
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:21,887	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The color pie that I love is
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:26,495	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It explains motivations in a way that doesn't demean the motivations
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:30,591	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Like what I think is really interesting the man that has made me think about life a little differently is
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:37,503	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Nobody's right or wrong they just have a reason for doing the things the way they do them and it's like oh what is their motivation
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:39,807	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	What's you're motivated by this
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,623	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Going to make sense you coming conflict with motivated by that
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,927	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I can argue and I have
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:47,231	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I can argue any color from any perspective
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:53,631	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Like one of these I did for fun at cuz I'm a writer is I did an interview and in my article is where I spent a whole column
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,655	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Each of the colors
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:57,471	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Interview with the colors having the color explained
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:59,007	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	From their perspective
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,287	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Why they do what they do
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:07,455	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	So how did this all play out back of the game shop when I was learning how to play for my instructor Nat
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:11,295	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Each hole has a very distinct personality and gameplay
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:14,367	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	What do the colors you use tend to Define what does
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:18,207	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Now it's my first game I played with a deck of cards where everything is red
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:21,279	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The magic I was using was fiery and impulsive
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:25,119	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	That's my natural instinct when I play games
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,911	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Which is why I often lose
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,447	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Because going on impulse
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:32,031	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Is my downfall whenever I'm supposed to be thinking strategically
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:35,615	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Meanwhile Nat was playing with a deck of black magic
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:39,967	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's all about sucking away your opponent's energy and using it for yourself
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:45,343	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	They're going to take one damage
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:49,183	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Brady dommermuth
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:51,231	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Is a lead writer in the creative team of magic
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:54,815	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Any says when he would work on developing a new set of cards
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:58,399	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	He always thought about how the story they're telling with the cards
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:01,727	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Should reflect the experience of people playing with a car
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:03,775	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Magic
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:05,311	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Defies one of the most common
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:08,383	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Ethos prescriptions
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,151	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	In fantasy
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,943	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And by that I mean
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:13,247	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	With the basic moral messages
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:15,295	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I love the story in Fantasy A lot of times is
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:19,647	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Sure you're the chosen one and you're destined to save the world
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,439	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But you're going to need
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:22,463	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Your friends
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:23,743	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Help you out
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,279	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	In doing so
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,839	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Button magic
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:28,607	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I felt like
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:32,703	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	In terms of the story in the world design that form needed to follow function
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:34,751	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And in magic
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:37,055	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The vast majority of games are played
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,847	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	1 vs 1
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,383	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's you versus me
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,175	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Is my deck versus your deck
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:44,223	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And either you're going to win or I'm going to win
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:47,807	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Which to me suggests a different ethos which is
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:50,367	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Sure of course you have to have friends
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,391	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	That's super important
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,159	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,439	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	In the final fight
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,207	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	When it matters
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,743	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	You're going to have to fight alone
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,279	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	In fact
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:15:00,095	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	He thinks that magic is often misrepresented
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,119	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Is a fantasy game
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,911	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Because traditionally
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:06,239	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Fantasy has been pretty black-and-white and its morality
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,799	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But when you play Magic the Gathering
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:11,359	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	You're not automatically a villain
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,383	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	If you use black magic
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:13,663	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And you're not
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:15,199	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Automatically the hero
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,223	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	If he is white magic
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:19,295	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Magic the Gathering
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:21,087	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Action reflects science fiction
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:24,159	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Is a long history of being morally ambiguous
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:27,999	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Mark rosewater have talked about that many times about how
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,535	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Star Wars
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,839	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	A fantasy story in sci-fi clothing

EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:48,479	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Spells and creatures are brainier
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:48,991	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Trickier
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,271	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And by the way
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:54,623	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	When you play the game you can play any combination of colors but since I was a newbie
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:56,671	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Nat felt that I should just play one color.
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:16:00,255	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I switched from red magic - Blue Magic
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:02,303	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I couldn't believe how differently the cards work
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:05,631	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And I felt like I was relying on a different part of my brain
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,935	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And my teacher Nat
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,959	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It also sweats
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:13,311	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Black magic white magic and I felt like I was playing against a different opponent
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:20,223	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	So overwhelmed right now
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:22,783	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	So many every card has so many like
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:26,367	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Levels to it
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:29,695	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's a very very complex game
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:33,023	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But that's when I realized how story can come into the
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,839	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Because to be a good magic player
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:39,679	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	You need to know why your cards behave the way they do
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,727	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And to do that
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,775	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Really helpful to go on the magic website
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:46,591	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And read the lore behind your car
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:49,151	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	What are the personality disorder
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:51,455	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	5 years or so I believed was to
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:55,295	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Make the cards reflect story events more aggressively
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:59,647	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Cards do
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,951	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	You can effectively learn how the story went
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:07,071	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	In fact I'm lying I found us some magic players have created fanart
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:07,839	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Or they imagined
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,887	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	What if Harry Potter
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,935	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Or the Marvel Cinematic Universe
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,495	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Rare cards in Magic the Gathering

EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:23,711	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Worth or it's kind of cool to see how they could be condensed into a single card

EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:38,559	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Pretty dommermuth always kept in mind that magic
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:41,887	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's not a movie or book reverse-engineer to be game
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,935	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It is first and foremost
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:44,959	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Again
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:50,591	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	One of the challenges for me and designing Magic World the reasons why undervalued plot
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:53,919	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's because I think that plot and games
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:54,943	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Are not friends

EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:04,415	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Or to choose the cards for your own deck
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,183	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Or
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:07,231	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Decide how you want to win the game

EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:22,591	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I avoided all my worst impulses
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:24,895	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And I became a better strategist

EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:52,607	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Complain about what they didn't like about it I'd remind myself that Millions
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:59,007	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The people were playing with this thing I designs and see a some people R&B focal and not like it but it just shows how much they care
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:00,287	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	About the
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,311	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	They're playing
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:02,079	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:07,455	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I can't sugarcoat it either I mean there are certainly some toxic players and wizards has
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,479	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Bantam
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,247	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Or at least
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:12,575	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Been working on their terms of service in terms of what they can do
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,111	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	No overall
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:16,159	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Liz loves the magic community
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,720	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	She even went on a Magic cruise once
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,024	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Just moments like this
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:24,096	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	What she wants went to an event and sat down to play a game
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:26,912	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The guy across from me while we're drafting ass
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:32,032	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	How I got into magic and I thought that was a nice question and you responded and told him
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:33,056	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The answer
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:37,408	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The answer is that she learned to play from an all-female group called The Lady planeswalker
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:37,920	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Society
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:40,480	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But the guy didn't seem to care
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,016	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	He just said
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,296	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I didn't think girls are into Magic
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,600	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And that was the end of the conversation
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:48,672	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	What is small innocuous comment
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:51,744	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Like in his head he probably didn't even think it was anything
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:55,840	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Play so remember it because it just made me feel even more a little bit like
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,864	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Wow
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:58,400	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Should I not be here
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,680	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:03,776	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Back it went when you're already playing Cambria to 100% on your
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:06,080	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	A game in terms of your mind and strategy
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,360	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It can
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:09,408	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Be a hurdle to overcome
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:15,552	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Is sci-fi fantasy spaces have become more inclusive over the years
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:17,856	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's been an ugly backlash
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,904	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And video games
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:22,464	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The Hugo book awards cosplay
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,000	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Star Wars fandom
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:28,608	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Any huge Community like magic the Gathering stop being immune to this problem
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:30,400	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	That's sad
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,192	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The game is always gotten price
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:33,472	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Since the beginning
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,776	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	For having diverse characters on the car
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:40,896	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But over time the creative team realized that they needed to be even more inclusive
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:46,784	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Alli medwin is an editor and designer who mostly Works in Magic digital division
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:49,344	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And a few years ago an intern
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:50,880	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Came up with an idea
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:53,440	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	What if they created a trans character
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:55,488	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	For new deck that they're working on
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,280	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Realized
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:58,560	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	This is
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:01,120	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	What we want representation to look like
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:04,704	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	This is a pretty natural flow like this is
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:06,240	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Not
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:08,288	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Shoehorned and this is not
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:12,128	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Tokenize this is a natural extension
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:13,920	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Of already established
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:14,688	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Things about
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:15,968	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The setting
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:19,296	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	They brought the idea to James Wyatt
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:21,856	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It was a senior creative designer on the story team
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:24,928	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Turn out to be a personal project for both of them
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,976	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Ali is trans
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,280	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Although she wasn't out at the time
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:30,816	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	That's for James
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:35,168	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	My daughter is trans so I send I need to write this story
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,704	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	For her sake
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:40,288	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Allie and James really wanted this character
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,312	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's called Alicia
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:43,104	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	To be a fierce Warrior
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,640	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Impact
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:46,176	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The car's official title is
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,968	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Alesha who Smiles at death
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:50,272	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	An illustration on the card
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,808	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Shows Alaska in full armor
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:54,624	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Leading the charge with her Army of the maardu Clan
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:24:00,768	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Want to thank the magic that I love about our game is that we don't tend to put boobplate
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,792	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Honor women
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,560	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,840	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	You can't really tell
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:05,888	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Water physiology looks like
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:08,448	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	James Rowe the backstory for the website
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:10,496	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And the biggest plot points
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,264	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	They argued over
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:13,056	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Was whether an antagonist
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:15,616	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Should confront A Lash about her identity
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:20,992	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	There was some sense and I've heard some people say this since the story was published that
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,784	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Maybe it would have been better if
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:27,136	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Unless it was just accepted for who she is with no question at all
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:31,232	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But we did end up with a character in the story who
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:35,072	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Challenges her and says you're just a boy with doesn't know who he is
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:39,168	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Which is a terrible awful thing to say
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:43,264	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	To my daughter it was really important that that was there
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,288	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Because she wanted
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,080	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Jehovah character
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,616	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Come to realize
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,408	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Eyelashes
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,456	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Worth and value and identity is who she is
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:55,552	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Funny little thing I remember discussing early on is
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:25:02,720	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	That Alaska was a good fit for the Marty for two reasons than one is that idea that they claim a war name and the other is the fact that
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,000	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	They don't use Blue Magic
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:07,584	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Because in the World of Magic the Gathering
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,632	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	If you have access to Blue Magic Lewis
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:13,984	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Personally about transformation and so it would actually be really easy to
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,008	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Change your identity
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:17,312	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Change your appearance change your body
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,592	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And we wanted
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,640	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Her experience to reflect
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:23,456	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Better the experience of real trans people in this world
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:25,248	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Without access to Blue Magic
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:27,552	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I'll tell you what if I had Blue Magic
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:32,160	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	My life might have gone a little differently a lot of people size might have gone a little differently
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:36,000	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	My daughter has actually designed a D&D spell that will allow that
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,536	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	As a permanent transition
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:38,560	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Nice
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:41,120	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	When they finally put the card out there
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:44,960	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	They were a little nervous but how the magic Community would react
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:46,496	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:52,384	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	There was so much positive reaction that I still cry
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,944	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It was it was overwhelmingly positive
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:57,248	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Yeah maybe one comment in 50
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:57,760	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Was negative
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:03,904	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The overwhelming majority overwhelming majority was positive
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:06,464	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The creation of his character Elijah
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,512	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Also had a big impact on Ally
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:10,304	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I lived
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:13,632	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I was going to call a stealth
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:14,656	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	For a long time
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:15,424	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It is
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:18,496	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I didn't talk about being trans I didn't let people know I
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,032	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I kept it a secret without
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,312	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	You have to lie lying about it
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:23,616	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I came out
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:24,896	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	About
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:26,176	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Halfway through the process
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,712	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:31,808	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It was that it was incredibly rewarding I was incredibly relieving
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,600	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Without a Lusha
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:36,416	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I would still probably be stealth which
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:39,232	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Look I'm not going to say doesn't work for some people cuz it does
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:41,280	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But it was a I felt
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:44,608	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I hope it doesn't burden and the less she was able to save me from that
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:49,728	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But Alexa isn't just a character in the story she's a character in a game
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:52,032	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Inner game mechanics are cool
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:55,616	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Michigan help you resurrect other cards that you've already used up
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:58,944	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And that's something that Allie really appreciates about magic
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:02,528	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The way game mechanics Inspire character development
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,040	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Vice versa
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:06,880	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It it takes to design and directions that
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:10,976	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	We wouldn't necessarily ever get to without
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:13,280	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The desire to
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:15,328	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Figure out how to express an idea
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,376	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Through the mechanics of the game
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,680	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I think that it would be possible to put
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,984	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Different stories on all the way
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:26,080	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I really love the stories that we've got but if you didn't have any story on on these cards
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,872	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	You'd be missing
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:28,896	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Solve
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:29,920	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Really
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:36,064	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	So I came into Magic the Gathering wondering two things
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:39,904	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Why is this game still so popular 25 years later
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:42,976	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	What is the role of Storytelling in a card game
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:50,144	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And I think the reason why magic has been so popular isn't just the story within the cards or the story about the cards
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,960	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The brand new story that emerges
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:55,008	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Every time someone plays the car
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:58,336	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The real story of a game as what happens
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,104	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Player
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:01,152	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Embrey Dahmer muses
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:02,944	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	That is increasingly rare
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:04,480	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I mean so many video games today
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:07,296	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Behaving like 5 Hour movies
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:09,344	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Give the player very little autonomy
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,648	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	In an era where
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,928	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	So many games are played
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:15,744	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Alone in front of your PC or in front of your console
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:20,096	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Magic requires this community requires the semen presents its
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,888	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's compelling enough in it
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:23,936	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Mechanic Smith gameplay and systems
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,984	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	That it wants to
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:28,544	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Hold onto your brain wants you to explore
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:29,056	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,592	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Complexities
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:32,128	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	But in order to do so
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:33,920	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	You have to interface with other humans
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:34,944	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:37,504	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Because of that it ends up being this
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:38,784	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Naturally viral thing
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:40,576	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Where
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,856	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	If I want to
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,136	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	See if my new deck works
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:45,184	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I'm going to have to find somebody to play it
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:50,560	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	In other words the magic of the game is real world human interaction
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,376	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Real world human interaction
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:55,168	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Is in short supply these

EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,696	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I asked Liz if she's any favorite car
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,256	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I love the card hydradoodle
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:24,096	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It's this Hydra but it's also a poodle and

EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:04,544	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And I play Magic the Gathering
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:08,384	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	My favorite thing to do is to try to find a combo
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:09,920	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Or something like that
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:11,968	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	That is so good that it will end up
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:15,040	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Destroying the four battle just to unbeatable
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:16,320	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Princeton the copycat
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:19,136	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The copycat combo
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:23,232	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The person who found a way to make incident little cat
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:27,328	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	To attack for damaged by around Turn 4 and it was
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:32,448	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	It was ridiculously consistent as a tattoo and everytime you want it turned out
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:35,008	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Said no one could beat it no one can find a way to beat it
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:37,568	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And everyone lost
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:43,968	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And eventually they found out it was so good that both cards need to be banned and taken out of the phone
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:44,992	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Charlie
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:47,296	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	So that it wouldn't go on like this
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:49,856	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Until your goal is to find another one of those
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:54,720	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	My name is Maslow and I also play Magic the Gathering
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:58,048	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I prefer playing the izzet colors which are red and blue
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:05,216	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	I'd like to play a lot of instants and sorcery cards and I normally play a little too many creatures for
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:06,240	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	For that type of deck
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:11,616	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	The great thing about instance is that you don't need to wait around while the other people's turns
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,384	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	You can
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:15,712	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Do stuff as long as you have enough Mana for it you can
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:17,760	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Play instances on other people's turn
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:19,808	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	What's an example of
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:22,112	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	A type of innocent party
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:23,136	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	You can play
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:24,928	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	For instance
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:26,464	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Get it
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:28,768	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	There is a
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:30,816	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	A card called Sonic
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:36,192	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Assault and I normally would play this on the phone it's turned when they're attacking and I'd say
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:38,496	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Before attacks results
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:41,312	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Itap user creature named here
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:45,152	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	And that packs and is an added bonus
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:49,248	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	Take control of that creature takes to damage cuz that's another feature of the car
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:57,184	| 335_Gathering_the_Magic_pt01 |	That was for a few old school Die Hard fan
