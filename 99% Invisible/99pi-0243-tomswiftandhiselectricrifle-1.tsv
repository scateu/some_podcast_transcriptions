EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:45,535	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	Work in real life on the street not just enough

EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:55,263	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	So the LAPD took the taser out onto the streets of South Los Angeles and began to test
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,055	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	Actually using it
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:59,871	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	On people they were trying to subdue and apprehend
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,943	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	A first device didn't do what the police wanted
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:05,503	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	And so they asked over to increase the power
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:06,527	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	Which he did
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,831	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	And then they took it out for more testing
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:11,391	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	And within within just six
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,159	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	10 days
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,951	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	Yeah we knew we had a winner
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:17,279	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	The LAPD put in an order for several hundred cases
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:20,351	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	And other police departments would soon follow
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:25,471	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	Today tasers are a huge business
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:29,567	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	Almost all tasers used by police in the US are made by one company

EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,367	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	Now use tasers
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:45,439	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	When Jack Carver died in 2009

EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:50,815	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	They believed his invention have saved a hundred thousand lives
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:54,399	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	Of course the story of tasers is way more complicated than that
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:58,495	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	One thing it's tough to save tasers have or have not save lives
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:04,127	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	Data on both police shootings and taser used are notoriously unreliable here in the US
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,175	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	And even if they're not designed to be lethal
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:09,247	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	Taser still produce an incredible amount of pain

EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:00,447	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	Which means are no longer considered firearms
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:03,007	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	The basic function has remained the same

EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:26,303	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	I think I might tap out then
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,839	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	Then I'm happy to go shorter
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:31,935	| 99pi-0243-tomswiftandhiselectricrifle-1 |	Then clock raises the weapon and points it at my back
