EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:49,824	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	More interesting was a secret from one of the other co hosts
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:51,104	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Julie Chen
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:54,432	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	My secret dates back to when I was
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,712	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	25 years old
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:58,272	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And I was working as a local news
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,040	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Border
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:00,064	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	In Dayton Ohio
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:02,368	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Wait Chantel.
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:05,184	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	She been paying your dues as a reporter
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:07,744	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But what she really dreamed about
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,024	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Becoming an anchor
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:17,216	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But when she approached your news director about the possibility
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:19,008	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	He gave her some
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:19,520	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Be back
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:24,640	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Because of your heritage because of your Asian eyes
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:27,712	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Sometimes I've noticed when you're on camera
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:29,248	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And you're interviewing someone
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,040	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	You look disinterest
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,576	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	You look bored
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,368	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Because your eyes are
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:36,928	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Art are so heavy they're so small
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,488	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	I hate people
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:40,512	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:44,864	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But Chen who's Chinese Americans found herself wondering if
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,912	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Maybe he had a point
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:49,984	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Reached out to a prominent talent agent for some career advice
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,288	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And he actually took it a step further
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,824	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	He said
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,848	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	I
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:55,616	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Cannot represent
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,200	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	You got
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:00,480	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Plastic surgery
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,760	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	To make your eyes look
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:02,784	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Bigger
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:06,112	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And then she admits to the audience that she did it
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,392	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	She got the surgery
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,696	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	A procedure called blepharoplasty
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:14,304	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	For people who are not of east or Southeast Asian descent
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:19,936	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Blepharoplasty is usually done to lift loose or sagging skin around the upper eyelids
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:21,216	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Is caused by aging
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:24,288	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Just Google Kenny Rogers before and after 2003
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:27,104	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But for a lot of people of Asian descent
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:29,664	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The surgery is more commonly referred to as
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,688	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Double eyelid surgery
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,736	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	About having visions
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:33,504	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Included
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,040	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Are born with with
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:37,088	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Called a monolid or a single eyelid
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:41,184	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Which means that there's no visible crease on the eyelid skin above Lashley
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,488	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	This is what Julie Chen had before
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,304	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The double eyelid surgery a decreased
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:51,424	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	So instead of the skin of the upper lid running smoothly from the bottom of the eyebrow
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:53,216	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Straight down to the eyelashes
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:56,544	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	There's now a small indented fold in the skin
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:58,080	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Just a few millimeters wide
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:01,152	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	That runs in a horizontal Crescent above the Lash line
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:05,760	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	This crease suddenly changes the eye shape in a way that makes the eye itself
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,040	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Appear slightly larger
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:11,904	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The simplest method doesn't even involve any Cuts just a few stitches along the eyelid
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,672	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	How to create the crease
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:16,000	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	John got the surgery in the mid-90s
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:19,583	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But she kept it hidden from the public up until 2013
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,375	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And that day
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,655	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Which tells the audience about it
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:26,239	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	It was surprising to me to hear her sounding so
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:29,311	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	I didn't want to show you what I'm really demonstrate like
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:31,615	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	What my news headshot
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,895	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Look like before I have this

EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:37,247	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	I mean if you look at the app
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:37,759	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	After
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:38,783	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	That
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,063	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The eyes are bigger
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,111	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	I look more
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:42,623	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Alert
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,207	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	More Express
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:50,303	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	What's the name of that response
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:52,095	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Sharon Osbourne saying fabulous
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,143	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	What is a serving to me
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:58,751	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Double eyelid surgery is one of the most popular procedures for Asian-American
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:03,103	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And hearing such a positive reaction it really is no wonder why
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:10,015	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The hopes of looking fabulous or more expressive for the same reasons why people in my own family have had the procedure
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,527	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Done themselves
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:14,879	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	In this ethnically specific surgery may have its roots in Asia
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:17,439	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But it wasn't Asian doctors who popularized
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:20,511	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	It was popularized by a white guy
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:21,535	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The US
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:25,631	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	He thought he was doing Asian people a favor by helping them look
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:26,911	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	West Asia
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,263	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But before we get to him
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:34,335	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The origin of double-eyelid surgery itself
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,359	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Dates back much further
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,919	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	19th century Japan
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:43,807	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Beauty standards will always vary from culture to culture and even within the same culture overtime
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:48,159	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Double eyelids are seen as a beauty preference for a lot of Asians and asian-americans today
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,463	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But that wasn't always the case
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:57,119	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	There's actually little to no record of double eyelids as an aesthetic preference until something called the Meiji restoration
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:02,239	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Before the 1860s Japan practiced a policy of isolationism
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,543	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And limited their contact with other Nation
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:07,359	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But during the Meiji restoration which
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:09,407	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Took place from the 1860's
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,687	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Do the early 1900s
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,223	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Japan opened up

EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:25,535	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	It was also around this time that the first double eyelid surgery was performed by Japanese surgeon

EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:33,695	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The South Korean government has lifted a ban on medical advertising and revised immigration rules to make it easier for

EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:28,352	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	So we talked a little bit about how War accelerated the development of medical field
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:30,400	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Like reconstructive and cosmetic surgery
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,192	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	It also drove the growth of

EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:35,520	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	A field at the intersection of

EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:38,080	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Art and Design

EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:46,016	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The surgery the development of
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:48,832	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Prosthetics really Advanced during World War but
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:51,136	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Specifically a branch of medicine called Annabelle
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,672	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Pathology which deals with
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,696	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Customized Prosthetics
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:57,024	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	People with missing or malformed parts of the body
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:57,536	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Especially for the
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:01,120	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	With a really rough time to be a soldier be
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:01,888	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Because technology like
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,168	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The machine gun
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,216	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Had advanced
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:07,520	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	To make killing people and injuring people
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:08,288	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	So much more of a
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:10,848	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Yeah you hit the nail right on the head
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:12,896	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And you're given the nature of
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:13,664	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Trench warfare
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:14,944	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Soldiers with needs
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:17,248	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Pop their heads out of these trenches
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,784	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Sapphire off rounds or two
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:19,296	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Dance
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:22,368	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Making their faces vulnerable so
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:24,416	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	It's made facial injuries really common
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,952	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But it was also this moment
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:29,024	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	History where medical treatment was starting to get a lot better which is
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:29,792	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Good
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,584	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But you also had men suffering from
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,376	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Terrible headphones and then surviving
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:35,168	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	So you have a lot of soldiers
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,472	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	They're literally getting shot in the face
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,264	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But they could now survive
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:41,824	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Really horrifying in of itself
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,848	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	It also made it hard
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,896	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	For soldiers to come home and have
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,920	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Normal life
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,200	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Nudist
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,736	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Figure meant exactly
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:50,528	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And reconstructive surgery was
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:52,576	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Beginning stages so you had things like
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:53,600	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Skin grafts
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,904	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But there really was nothing
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:56,416	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Do in terms of
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:58,720	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Surgery for someone who had
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:23:59,744	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	You know their jaw
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:00,256	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Take it off
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,304	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Keeping cold with her
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:03,584	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Used to be
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:07,168	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	So anaplastology picked up in an aesthetic way where we can see
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:11,264	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And this is a really interesting intersection between
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,288	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Art in medicine
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:16,640	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Rate so you need to be able to recreate a human face
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,920	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Which takes a lot of artists
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:20,992	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Talent and that's where artists like Anna Coleman Ladd came in
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:24,832	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Should an American sculptor who lived in Boston at the time a lot of her
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:27,648	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Pre-World War 1 artwork involves making like
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:29,440	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The bounding nymph
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:32,512	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And happy baby sculptures that you'd find in fountains
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:35,840	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And she founded something called the studio for portrait masks
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:37,376	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	In France which made
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,144	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Facial masks
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:39,936	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	For veterans with severe injuries
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:40,704	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	To the face
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,984	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	So how did an artist
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:42,752	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	From Boston
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,288	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Go on to found this
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:45,568	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Studio in France
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:47,104	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Really locked ignition
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:49,408	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	She moved to France with her husband because
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,968	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Cuz he was a doctor with the American Red Cross
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:56,576	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And while she was there she right about this other sculptor and London who's making these facial
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,600	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Pieces for veterans
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:25:00,160	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	So she got funding from the Red Cross
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,440	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Do something similar in France
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Not so cool
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,512	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	So what type of work goes into making
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,072	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Each mask
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:08,608	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Would take about a month now
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,400	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	To make ladwood
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:13,984	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	ACH look off of pictures of veterans before their injuries
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,264	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	To try to match his clothes sleep
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,568	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Possible what they look like originally
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:19,616	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	I'm in the process involves you know taking a
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,408	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	A plaster cast of their face
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,176	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Basis
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:22,944	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And then she
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:24,992	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Shape the mask itself out of the things she
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:27,552	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Sheet of galvanized copper and B Skagway
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:29,856	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	You up to half a pound depending on
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,136	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	How large the injury was
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,672	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And they were held
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:35,488	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Face usually using in a string or wire
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,768	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Sometimes they would use
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:37,280	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Eyeglasses
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,560	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Keep Monica
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:40,864	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	They wanted eyeglasses
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,144	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Copper
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,680	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Amazing
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,472	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	It seems like it takes a lot of
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:48,032	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Krave interpretation to make the right type of mask
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:50,336	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Can a metal right yeah that's what made these
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:51,872	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Specifically so special
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:53,408	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	She would have to
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:54,176	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The hand paint
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:55,456	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Each of the mass directly
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:57,760	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	On their faces to make sure that their skin tones match
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:00,320	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And matching the skin tone is
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,088	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Especially tricky
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,112	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Because you know
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,392	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	When you're outside
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:06,208	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Healed your skin will change depending if you're in this
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:08,000	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The sign or if you're in the shade
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:09,536	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	So she would basically need
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:10,560	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	To split the difference
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:12,864	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Between the two colors to make sure it wasn't
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,400	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Extreme in either condition
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:20,288	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And she'd also you know either use real human hair or slivered tinfoil to create the eyebrows
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:20,800	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Or a mustache
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:24,384	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And my favorite detail that you would do is
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:25,920	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	You know it's the mask
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:26,944	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Had to cover
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:27,712	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	The mouse
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,736	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Of the recipients
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,016	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	She would leave
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,808	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Modafinil it's just wide enough
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,088	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	4 of a cigarette
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,928	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Guess at that point
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:43,840	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Smoke up enjoy life
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:48,960	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	They do anything they really were just cosmetic
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,776	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Chew food or see again
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:55,104	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But you know for someone who had already suffered a massive
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:57,408	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Facial injury that you can really mean a lot
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,712	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	It's such an interesting work
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,736	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	I mean in the pictures
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:02,272	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Really stunning
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,808	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	It's hard to describe these
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:06,112	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Because when you think of a half
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:06,880	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Pound
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,416	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Copper mask on someone's face
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:11,232	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Probably doesn't sound like it's going to be very realistic
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:14,560	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	But there's this video Vlad fitting these masks
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,840	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	Veterans and it's
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:18,400	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	It's amazing how transformative they are witches
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:18,912	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	I see them in
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:22,496	| 321_Double_Standards_pt_01 |	And you can see for yourself on a video that we have up on the website
