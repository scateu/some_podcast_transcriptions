EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:14,240	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	I think if you ask somebody on the street
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:18,336	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	What is camouflage I believe most
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:20,384	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Common answer would be so well
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:21,920	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	It is a figure
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:25,504	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	And it's being blended with its background
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:30,624	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	The scientist today call that background matching by similarity camouflage

EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:45,472	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	I wouldn't go that far. What I do
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:49,312	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Item molarity or blending is just one type of camouflage
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:50,848	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Kind of boring one
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:55,200	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	But another type of camouflage that you can find both in nature and in military use
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:56,992	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	It's disruptive camo

EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:09,024	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	It's the opposite of high similar to camouflage it's high differ
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,816	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	So you're making it
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:12,096	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Very difficult
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:14,912	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	For us to look at the figure and to see it as
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,192	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Only a single

EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:28,992	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Make it hard for a predator to distinguish one zebra from another
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,296	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	When the zebras are in a large herd

EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,208	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	But when it comes to humans
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:38,976	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	The greatest
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:41,024	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Most jaw-droppingly

EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,680	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Is Razzle Dazzle
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,896	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Camouflage
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:03,040	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Strictly applies to ship camouflage and even more strictly it applies to World War 1
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:07,648	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	And it came about because it was discovered
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,928	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	It's
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,976	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Almost impossible to make a ship
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,000	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Invisible
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,536	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	On the ocean

EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,680	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Amount of light
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:25,824	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	So they're all kinds of conditions that make its way constantly moving ship can't blend into the background
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,104	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Odyssey
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:33,504	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	And even if you could make a ship invisible you still have smoke coming out of smokestack so it's not as if your
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,272	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Hiding ship it all
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:37,856	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	To the less heavily armored ships were sitting ducks
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:44,256	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	The crisis came about at the time that the US had not yet entered the war remember this is World War 1
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,536	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	It was the British ships
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,072	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	That were being sunk and
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:50,656	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	The German submarines were sinking as many as
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,448	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	50 ships
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:52,960	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	A week
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,520	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Naval ships were Merchant ships
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:56,800	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	And they were
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,360	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Bringing supplies
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,128	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	2
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:03,712	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Which is an island of course send
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:06,016	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	It really depended on those and then also there was
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:08,832	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Armaments and other things that were being secretly taken there
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,600	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Where to
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:12,416	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	So the design solution was not about invisibility
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,464	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	It was about disruption
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:19,327	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	A number of artists decided that the best way to avoid getting torpedoed
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:21,631	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Was not to make the ship invisible
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,679	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	But to make it
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,703	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Hard to hit
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,751	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	That's why
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,287	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	These kind of erratic
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:31,871	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Crazy quilt patterns came about and that's why they were used in that war
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,663	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	It's going to be hard at pictures
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,687	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Best but I'm waiting to try
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:38,271	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	There was a time when military ships

EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,871	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	And mystification
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:07,711	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Black and white was very common they consist of

EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,855	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Was
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:17,183	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Use predominantly especially in the British versions
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:19,743	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	But I think you'd be surprised
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:25,887	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	The range of colors there were Reds that were Sometimes using greens and really quite intense oranges

EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,711	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Fascinating to the public
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:41,503	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	You have to remember that this is happening
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:45,087	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Just a few years after the
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:48,927	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	What's called The Armory show in New York it's the first

EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,583	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	And it was the introductory show up

EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,423	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	All of those things that
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,727	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	People make fun of and they thought
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:04,543	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Good universities are really crazy directions for artists to be going in
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,823	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	When this happened
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:08,127	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	People looked at those ships and they said
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:11,199	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Succubus nightmare
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,991	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Futuristic
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:17,343	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	As you can probably guess they were plenty of people
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:19,647	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Who hated Dazzle camouflage
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,695	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Traditional Navy men most
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:26,303	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	So they compared it to the clothing it up prostitute would wear and they make fun of it
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:28,095	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Here's how it work
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,887	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	The steps
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:35,007	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	At the time Torpedoes fired from U-boats were quite slow maybe taking a couple minutes
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:38,591	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	To reach their target so the person firing the torpedo
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:40,127	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Had to lead the target
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,407	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	He had to anticipate
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:44,479	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Where the target ship was going to be
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,527	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	When the torpedo arrive
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:49,343	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	So we had to calculate how to do that in that
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,879	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	During which depended on knowing
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:54,207	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	The exact angle it's it's headed toward
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,743	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	That's terribly terribly bored
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:58,815	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	And the other thing is that you have to figure out
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,839	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	The speed
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,375	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Of the ship
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,911	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Because then you'll know
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,959	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	How far to go by the time the torpedo
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	The Dazzle camouflage certainly made the ship
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,287	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Stand out
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:11,871	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	But they're bulging shapes and Vivid hues
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:14,175	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Also made it difficult to determine the
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:17,247	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Speed and direction of the moving ship
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,551	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	It's praying on our assumptions about
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:20,831	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Things
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:23,135	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Looking smaller as they are more distant
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:27,231	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	So you could paint perspective patterns on a ship
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,023	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	That would make it look like it was
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:29,791	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Turning
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:35,423	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Is a different direction when in fact that you're actually seeing them frontally and they're absolutely flat
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,703	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Bedazzled patterns
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,983	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Broke up to figure
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:40,031	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	So that I can look shorter than it really was
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:44,127	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Or I can make it hard to tell if there is one shift for multiple ships
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,407	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	But even painted
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,943	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Fake ball waves on them
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,735	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	And they would paint the
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,759	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Fake bow wave
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,295	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Either on the front
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:53,343	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	To make it look like the ship was going fast
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,391	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	What's actually going
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:57,439	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Cuz that was one way of calculating
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,743	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Or fish would
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,791	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Paint the bow wave
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:02,559	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	On the back
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,607	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	And so you would glance at it
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:07,423	| 99pi-0065-razzledazzle-1 |	Why you looking through this Periscope you might conclude that
