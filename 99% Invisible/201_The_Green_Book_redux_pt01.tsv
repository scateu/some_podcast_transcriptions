EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:16,768	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Curtis would eventually become a Texas State representative
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,815	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And then he go on to work at NASA

EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:29,567	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	His parents tried to Shield him from that reality
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:34,175	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	I've often said that both my mother and father were the best Liars that I knew
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:36,991	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	For instance we sat in the back of the bus
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,783	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Because it was cooler there
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,599	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	We rode in the front of the train because
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:43,135	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Are you could get off quicker
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:46,463	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	I wish that upstairs in the movie because

EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,071	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Of course that ruse can laugh
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:56,703	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And by the time Curtis with a college senior in Houston Texas in the mid-1950s
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:01,567	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	He was fully aware of what it meant to be a black person living under Jim Crow
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:06,175	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	There's one experience in particular that stands out in his mind
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:12,831	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	He was just 21 years old and getting ready to drive to a college meeting in Waco about 3 hours Northwest of Houston
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:19,999	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Did agree to take a couple of acquaintances they happened to be white women but I said to myself
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,303	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Might be in for some difficult times here
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:29,215	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	But you know I had to sold Yuan to get to Waco
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:35,615	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Stretch of East Texas that was Notorious in those decades for racial violence oh yeah
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:42,015	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Those communities were pretty bad around dusk The Travelers got hungry so they pulled over at a roadside
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:48,415	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Thai Diner as soon as we got in the front door the guy said sorry but you can't come
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:51,999	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And here we don't serve black people at all
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:56,095	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	So the three of them went back outside and Curtis devised a plan
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:58,143	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	They try another restaurant
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,423	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Right across the street
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:04,031	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	I said to them the two of you go in get a table
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:10,943	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And after you seated and the waiter or waitress comes up to you tell them that you have a boy that's
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:11,711	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Driving you
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:16,063	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And that you want to know whether he can you can bring him in to eat
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:22,463	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	So the women walked inside and they asked the waitress of Curtis could come inside to join them
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:24,255	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Of course no problem at all
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:27,327	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	So as long as I was that boy
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:30,143	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And their driver I could eat
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:33,471	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	With them at a table in a restaurant
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:36,543	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	But if I were equal to them I could not
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:44,223	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	This kind of humiliation on the road was routine and had been going on for decades
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:49,343	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Many people wrote Into the NAACP around this time describing experiences

EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,847	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Then found a vacant table
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:13,407	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	10 minutes past and no one came to service
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:19,295	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	He informed me that the restroom for the color was in the back
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:25,695	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	It seems to me dealers should not be permitted to sell gas and oil and not provide these comfort

EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:48,639	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Go do his route in Hackensack New Jersey come back home and work on the green book at night
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:52,735	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Compiling these addresses typing them up and put them in a book for
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,807	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	This is Calvin Alexander Ramsey
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,343	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Playwright author and filmmaker
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:58,879	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And years ago
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:01,439	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Calvin started researching the history of the green book
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:05,535	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	He learned that the green book wasn't really the first guy.
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,303	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Science
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,071	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	In fact
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:09,887	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Victor may have gotten the idea from Jewish Travelers
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:13,471	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Because the Jewish Community was also having
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,263	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Issues on the open road
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:18,079	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	A lot of places saying restricted
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,895	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And it was a cold word for Gentiles only
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:24,991	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	When Victor published his first green book it just covered New York
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:30,111	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And he heard around the country from other carriers and other people saying we really need this Nationwide
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:36,255	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	But it wasn't that easy together information from across the country back then long distance phone calls were expensive
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,559	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And that Calvin says
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,607	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Is when Victor green realized
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:42,399	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	That being a mailman
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:47,519	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Was his secret superpower there were African-American let it carries all over United States
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:49,567	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	At this time we talked about 1936
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:52,127	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And so he knew about you know
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,663	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	The relationship
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,967	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	That the mail men have with their
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,015	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Homeowners or apartment dwellers
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:02,623	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Delivering my mail so just like today the mailman is part of the community
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:05,439	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	So Calvin says Victor tapped into this network
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:10,815	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Spreading the word about his guide through the National Alliance of postal and federal employees
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,863	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	A letter carrier Union
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:16,447	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Calvin says postal workers across the country
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:20,031	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Scouted potential Green Book locations and their cities and towns
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:23,615	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	He says it's some even asked families they delivered to
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:26,431	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	If they'd be open to hosting Travelers in their home
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,991	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And if they agreed then
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:31,807	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	They will send the information to Victor Green in Harlem
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:36,415	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Victor was able to get a feel for us
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,999	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Of letter carriers who are all over the country
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:46,143	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Acquire material and names and addresses and businesses for him black mailman
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,679	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	You got a green book salesman
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,447	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	For recruiter
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:56,127	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Pretty quickly the green book caught on businesses many black-owned began getting in touch with Victor hope
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:58,687	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Open to advertise and hoping to be listed
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:01,247	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Black newspaper signed on as sponsors
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:06,367	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Victor eventually retired from his job as a letter carrier and started working on the guy full-time
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,439	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Keven opened unaffiliated travel agency
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,487	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	But hope Torres deranged traps
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:14,559	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	But still there was the challenge of distribution
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:17,631	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	How to get the Guide into the hands of Travelers who needed it
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:23,007	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	That happened in a few ways the United States travel Bureau signed on to help out
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:26,335	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And then there would be more informal networks well churches
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:30,175	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Pullman porters the Urban League NAACP
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,967	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	The Masonic lodges
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:35,807	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	There was a very wide varied distribution
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:38,623	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Process in place for these Green books
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:41,439	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And there was an important corporate sponsor to
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:45,023	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	A big one
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:50,143	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Gas-X extra fine

EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:08,063	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Was one of the fuel oil companies back then then actively pursued Black customers they franchise their stations
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,855	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Two African American operators
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:14,463	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And he had a black representative on staff James billboard Jackson
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:17,279	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Who helped plays Green books in many of those stations
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:19,071	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	As well as the White on Once
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:23,167	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	So may have done this out of a sense of fairness and equality
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:27,775	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	John D Rockefeller who founded Standard Oil in 1870
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,823	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	I married into a family of abolition
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,127	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Who were part of the Underground Railroad
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:35,199	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And he voted for Abraham Lincoln back in the day
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:39,039	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	But I probably did it for another reason to
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,319	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Money honey
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:46,207	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	It has to do with money Curtis who had the crappy experience driving across East Texas
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:52,863	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	His dad operated one of the first black-owned Esso stations in New Orleans where Curtis was born and raised
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,423	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	It was called the Bootsy and Buddies
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:13:00,031	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	The economic logic of stocking the green book was pretty simple he says
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:04,127	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	If you want black people to buy your fuel
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:10,015	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Why don't you give them an opportunity to see that they can travel and find places to stay
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:12,063	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	While they're on the road traveling
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:16,159	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	The Curtis's dad kept a shelf of Green books for
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:16,671	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	It's customers
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:20,767	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	You know if somebody came in and said no. Buddy I'm
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:23,839	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	I'm thinking about taking a trip to Chicago my dad would say well
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:30,751	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Yep do you know where to stop between here and Chicago and other person would say no say what happened
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:32,031	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	The green book will tell you
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:35,103	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And it gave you a sense of
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,895	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Security
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:43,807	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Into the green book came to cover listings in all 50 states and even some locations in Canada the Caribbean

EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:13,247	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	But as a civil rights struggle continued
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:16,319	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Some people began to question the value of the green book
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:22,207	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	Black people many of them began to feel that this was accommodating to Jim Crow

EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:34,239	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	It really took on an overtly political town

EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:41,151	| 201_The_Green_Book_redux_pt01 |	And there were actually other black travel guides published around the same time the Dead
