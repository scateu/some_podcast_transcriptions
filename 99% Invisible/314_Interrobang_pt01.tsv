EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:39,456	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	That's probably a little bit bloated
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,224	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	I don't know I don't know
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:43,296	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Chris was the first one to use a hashtag on Twitter
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:49,696	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Before it was even called a hashtag back in August of 2007 when he was going to an event called barkcamp it's a nerdy thing
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:55,584	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	It's an event that you go to that completely unstructured and unplanned and the participants figure it out
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,888	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	So the participants needed a way of organizing
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:00,960	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Which led Chris to tweet the very first hashtag
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:03,776	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Even though at that point it was just a pound sign
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:06,080	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	How do you guys feel about using
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,104	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Pound
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:07,872	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Barkcamp
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:14,272	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Four groups putting a pound sign in front of the word barkcamp helps the other people at bar
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:20,672	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Pick out the word Barr camp in their Twitter stream and encourages all the other bar Camp distance to use
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:27,072	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Barkcamp in their tweets
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:33,472	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Invitation says some people got on board and agreed to use the pound
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:39,872	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	But most were like okay you go do that the pound symbol had already probated other corners
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:46,272	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	The Web Internet relay chat AKA IRC use the pound sign to represent chat rooms or Converse
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,296	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Versation channels
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:50,368	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	There's another Haiku that also have these channels
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:53,184	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	So there was other stuff that came before me
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:56,256	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	But Chris was using bunch of pound signs throughout his tweets
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,024	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	I was putting
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,560	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Pound symbol
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,584	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	In front of my words
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,888	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	If you were like I don't understand what you're doing
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:03,424	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	You're putting all this strange punctuation in
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:04,448	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Stop and
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:05,728	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	It looks.
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:08,032	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	But the True Believers stood by the sign
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:10,336	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	One Twitter user called it a hash
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:10,848	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Tag
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,664	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Because hash is the British name for the sign
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,456	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	And these are being used as category
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:21,856	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Tags
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:25,440	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Anacortes directly but they thought it would never catch on the look clunky
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:28,768	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Then a few months later in October of 2007
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:31,328	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	The purpose of the hashtag was fully realized
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,120	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	A friend of mine was down in
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:40,032	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	San Diego isn't even a traitor and he was using Twitter basically pulling all the stuff together around these fire that we're going
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,800	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	San Diego
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:47,200	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	San Diego
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:53,600	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	He was fixing all of his tweets with Sans face Diego space fire
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:58,208	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Switch to hashtag San Diego fire all one word and then other users would imitate him
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:23:59,744	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	And it worked
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:03,840	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	People trying to find out about the fire do exactly where to look on Twitter
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:08,448	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	And this was a moment where everyone went oh that's what these signs are for
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:09,216	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Clarify
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:14,848	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Hashtags were nothing that Twitter planned on and they coming to drag their feet on incorporating it
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,616	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	We kept thinking
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:17,920	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	There must be a better way to organize all this information
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:18,944	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	What's going through Twitter
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,224	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	I'm weak I'm looking for a week
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:21,248	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Really found it
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:22,272	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	What the hashtag
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,088	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Andy Lawrence
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:28,160	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Let an employee at Twitter officially brought in the hashtag
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:31,232	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	The users brought in the hashtag what all I did was link
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:31,744	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	The hashtag
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:32,768	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Twitter search
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:34,560	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	One line of code
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:35,072	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Took me about 15
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:36,864	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Ask anybody
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:43,264	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	That one line of code meant that when you click on a word with a hashtag in front of it you'd see a page with all the other tweets that
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:45,056	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Also contained that hashtag word

EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:54,592	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	This is also why British currency the pound
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:57,920	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Is represented by a stylized L for Libra
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:00,736	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	So the abbreviation lb becomes a thing
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:03,808	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	And oftentimes it was drawn with a little bar
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:04,576	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Across the top
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:05,088	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Both letters
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:08,160	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Just to show that the L and the B were connected

EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:27,104	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Rise to the pound symbol for hash mark or Lumberyard overtime the symbols meaning started it by 4
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:33,504	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	It was used like lb for the unit pound and also started to be used as a number sign
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:35,296	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	It had a lot of various uses
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,576	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	What is important enough
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,600	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	To wind up falling

EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:39,904	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Which is
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:44,000	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Kind of that the keys thing is the thing that symbol had to do in order to survive
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:48,096	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Symbols that didn't make it onto a typewriter keyboard got pretty unpopular
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:50,656	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Like the interrobang the pilcrow
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,680	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Manicure
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:52,704	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	4 things
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:56,032	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Fast forward to 1963
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:58,848	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	The invention of the touch-tone telephone
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:05,248	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Hi this is a bell systems new at Stone Valley
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,016	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Rotary wheel
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:10,624	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	So unlike previous phones the numbers didn't have to be arranged in a circle on the dial anymore
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:19,328	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Bell Laboratories a research subsidiary of AT&T experimented with a few different designs for the telephone keypad
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:24,192	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	They try to arranging the numbers into rows of 5 in a circle and a cross
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,216	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Step pattern
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:30,336	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	But they ended up using the numbers 1 through 9 in a 3X3 grid
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:32,896	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Can you put zero alone in the bottom center
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:35,456	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Years later in 1968 they figured
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:41,856	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Why not add keys to either side of the zero this would make the keypad into a rectangle
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:44,160	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	There's a few more options on the phone menu
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:45,952	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	To repeat these options
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:46,976	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Press the star key
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:50,048	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Because unlike rotary phones
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:53,120	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Touch-tone phones allow you to continue to dial
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,656	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	After the connection has been made
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:29:01,312	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	So you could punch in extensions and navigate automated menus
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,360	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Press 2
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:05,664	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Originally Bell Labs wanted
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:07,968	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Pretty shapes on the two extra buttons
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:11,808	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	That made prototype phone that had a five pointed star and a diamond
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:18,208	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	On either side of the zero Doug Kerr would have none of this diamond and five point star business
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:21,280	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Because by that time a new thing and coming to the picture
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:28,192	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	The possibility of customers dialing directly from their phones into a computer for such things as checking bank balance
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:30,496	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Cesare validating their credit cards or what have you
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:35,360	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Doug Kerr wanted to make sure that the two new symbols will be once a computer could recognize
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:39,456	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Ones that appear on a keyboard and we're part of the computers vocabulary
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:45,856	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	So there would be no uncertainty about how a certain button would be recorded in the data that went into the
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:52,256	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Computer Bell Labs was pretty set on their star and Diamond idea so the compromise was an ass trick for the star in
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:54,304	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	In a pound for the diamond because
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:55,584	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	You know the
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,352	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Center
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:30:02,752	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	How to look Diamond like I guess for a second AT&T was like can we at least call it a diamond
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:04,288	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	The call that symbol diamond
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:08,384	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	It's not a diamond at all AT&T didn't know what to call this button in their manuals
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:11,968	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	And this led to the creation of what some people including Keith Houston
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:13,760	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Consider the symbols official name
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:16,320	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	The octothorpe the octothorpe
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:18,624	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	One day I was out with my
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:20,160	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Engineering partner
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:26,560	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	And we got to talking about it and thought maybe we should come up with a new name this is like to work in marketing for AT&T
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:27,328	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	During the time
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:29,632	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Ian is engineering partner look at the symbol
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:33,728	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	And saw that I had eight line sticking out of it in there
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:35,776	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Tendentious autofit hair weave
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:39,616	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	The RP
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,896	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	In there too
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:43,456	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Because it sounds kind of Greek ashamed
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,736	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Davidson statue
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:51,136	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	They called it an octothorpe but that morphed into octothorpe with rumor has it came about because someone involved
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:54,976	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Change the name to turn it into a tribute to Olympic Athlete Jim Thorpe
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:56,256	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	But no one really knows
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:58,048	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	G is it proper to spell it
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:31:00,352	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Octave Thorpe rather than Thorpe
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,888	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	There is no proper
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:03,936	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Doug called it an octothorpe
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,216	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Lauren called it a knock
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:06,752	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Dother buttock
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,520	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Joe Thorpe
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,824	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Seems to have the most widespread use
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:11,616	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	There with you is not widely
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:18,528	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Originally the only reason octothorpe ever caught on with him Bell Labs was because Engineers thought it was funny joke
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:20,064	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	The manufacturer Western elect
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,856	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Totally hated that name
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:23,392	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	And pretty much killed in the 70s
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:25,440	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	But today for a lot of type of fishing out
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:26,976	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Octothorpe
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:28,000	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Is the signs real
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:29,536	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	In typography
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,584	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Is the name Hughes
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:32,864	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	You might think
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:37,984	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Topographic nerds like Keith love it because it feels the most neutral and official
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:40,032	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Been to this symbol whatever it's called
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:43,104	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Doug Kerr and the other Bell Labs engineers
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:47,456	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Really understood that we would be using telephones to communicate with computers
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:51,808	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	And this is exactly the same reason why Chris Messina chose to use this symbol
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:53,856	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Back in that tweet in 2007
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:55,648	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	At the time we had
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:56,928	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Blackberry Smirnoff
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:58,464	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Neither Hardware base
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:01,024	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Best keyboards
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:04,864	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	SMS because that's the way that I'm going to be publishing Twitter
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:08,192	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Which left Chris only two choices the star with a pound
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:09,728	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Whatever
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,264	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	It's
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:13,056	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Probably one of the most dense symbols
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:16,640	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	And so when you're reading a sentence while you're reading a tweet
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:23,040	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	It stands out hashtags on promotional materials on other social media platform
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:24,320	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Amazon protest signs
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:30,720	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	In your annoying friends conversations
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:33,024	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	And this is all probably going to sound
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:35,328	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Sarah dated in like 5 years
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:36,352	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	For two years
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:37,632	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Or maybe a few months
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:43,520	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Hearing hashtag out loud I'm going to sound like someone reading a telegram

EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:04,768	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	And what we're needing to do is actually invert the Paradigm where the computers become more friendly to Human
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:09,888	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	So we're probably not going to be using hashtags the way Twitter use hashtags
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:11,168	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	Forever
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:13,472	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	But this won't mean the end of the symbol itself
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:20,384	| 314_Interrobang_pt01 |	It started out on paper but then it leaped to typewriters computers and phones and it seems like it's probably going to stick around
