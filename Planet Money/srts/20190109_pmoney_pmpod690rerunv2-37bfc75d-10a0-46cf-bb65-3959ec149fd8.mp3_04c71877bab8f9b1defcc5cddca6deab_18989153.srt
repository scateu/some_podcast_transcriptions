This episode originally ran in 2016

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:06,400
At the end of the show will give you an update on this

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:10,752
On a hot day in the summer of 2012

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
Derek Walters drives

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,080
To the Rio Casino in Las Vegas

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,408
He's going there to play in the most famous poker tournament in the world

7
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:20,224
The World Series of Poker main event

8
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,016
What do you wear to these tournament

9
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,808
Personally I just try to

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,088
We're like comfortable clothes

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,136
Like a tracksuit

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,928
Not not attracted I try to like

13
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,488
Look presentable just like jeans

14
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
T-shirt hoodie

15
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,304
Sunglasses or no sunglasses

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,120
I don't wear sunglasses

17
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,656
Yeah it would just be weird

18
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,936
Timmy wearing them inside

19
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
Because in fact

20
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,008
It is weird to wear sunglasses inside

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,640
We're back in Las Vegas for the 43rd edition of poker's most prestigious tournament

22
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,456
Derek like everyone at the tournament has to pay

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
$10,000

24
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
To play

25
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
If you wins

26
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
First prizes

27
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,344
Eight and a half million.

28
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,136
Derek is a professional

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,976
And he figures he's got an itch there's always going to be

30
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,048
Simpro is at your table and there's going to be some recreational players

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,096
Usually kind of like split half and half

32
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,424
When you say recreational players or is that just a nice guy saying bad

33
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,544
Yes that's the yeah that's a PC weigh at one of the

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,568
The PC way to say no

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,152
Derek is going to pick off these recreational players

36
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,176
One by one

37
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
And make

38
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,248
The Killing that is the plan anyway

39
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,040
But that is not how things

40
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,624
On the very first day of the tournament Jericho's All In

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
And you lose

42
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
He's out

43
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
It's a pretty bad feeling

44
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,792
You lose loss of your chips what you put them over to the other player end

45
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,096
Just kind of collect your things and just like

46
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,424
Do the Walk of Shame out of the poker broom to your car

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
The hallways are so quiet

48
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
Just because like everyone's out their seats playing

49
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,616
The $10,000 Derek used to buy into the World Series of Poker

50
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
That is gone

51
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
And Derek

52
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
Is completely out of the tournament

53
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
Except

54
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,016
He isn't

55
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:03,136
In fact the 2012 main event is going to be the biggest payday of Derek Walters life

56
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,024

All right bring it on before 6598 players compete for poker is most import

73
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,616
Morton title the tournament rooms are empty

74
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
No players

75
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:01,760
No dealers no Stories the only thing that fills the room

76
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
Is Hope

77
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,600
That is how you report on an empty room

78
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,696
Outside that empty remote there are some pretty great stories

79
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,280
One of those stories is about that player Derek you heard of the beginning

80
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,632
He's renting this house about five miles south of the Las Vegas Strip with some of his poker but

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,984
It's a nice house there's a pool table upstairs swimming pool in the back

82
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,544
The youngest guy in their group is just 21

83
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,104
He's a skinny guy with longest hair they were kind of

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
Swept across his forehead

85
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
His name is Jake Paul

86
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,248
He told us he didn't actually get his own room in this

87
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
Sleeping on the couch

88
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,368
There was a huge couch looks pretty nice actually

89
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,696
In terms of this group of guys that you're staying with

90
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
Were you kind of the low man on the totem pole

91
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
Unquestionably

92
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
Jake cannot afford to buy into the

93
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,704
It cost $10,000 and he's in college

94
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
What is friends with a bunch of the guys we come down for a visit

95
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
He figures he'll go home once the tournament

96
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
I no intention of playing it

97
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
You know you was a lot of money night

98
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
I didn't get them for asking that or anything you know

99
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Tonight

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
My friend Max is having his birthday party that day

101
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
Actually literally packed up

102
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
Everything about the Vegas into my car

103
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:19,327
And I was going to leave in there like you to just hang out the other party for you to a couple hours I can drive home like anytime today is fine just the same

104
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
For a little bit

105
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
The party goes on for a while

106
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
People are drinking

107
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
And Derek and the other guys are like

108
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,591
Jake you got to do this you just turned 21 you can actually legally play in the tournament it's the World Series

109
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
Is the main event

110
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,687
I don't have any good mood.

111
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:39,039
But they're like oh you know many you got to find Amanda's to stay for the main won't buy a piece

112
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
The guy say look we will

113
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:45,439
Payforit we will pay the $10,000 so you can play who are these friends

114
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
I don't know I don't have friends

115
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
Actually they're not just

116
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
Giving him the money

117
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
His roommates are offering to stake him

118
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
That is the

119
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,447
And what it means is that they're going to be investing in jail

120
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,823
If someone ships in 10% of the buying back I will get 10% of whatever Jake

121
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
Kids sleeping on the couch

122
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
Did you pass a hat in

123
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,735
And people just be like I'll put in 1500 like how did that actually work

124
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:14,623
Really pretty much though so I don't know who first said it but one of them was like yeah you know I'll take like

125
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,951
10%

126
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,023
10 + 15

127
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,095
If I lost I lost but it's not to do tutorial

128
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
So if Jay Quinn

129
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
He would get to keep some of them

130
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
But most of it would go to his roommates

131
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
Like Derek

132
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
Terry puts in $1,500

133
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
And now he basically owns shares in

134
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
Jake is a stalker

135
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
MGK is not his only invest

136
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,199
Derek actually has to make it

137
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Spreadsheet

138
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
To keep track of all the players he

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Investing money

140
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
I see a lot of these

141
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
Are screen names is that okay

142
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Yeah that's fine

143
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,415
Okay so

144
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695

157
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
I think that's

158
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
I think that's it

159
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,807
Some of these guys Derek is friends

160
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
But some he says

161
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
He wouldn't recognize even if you ran into them at the tournament

162
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,951
They're just poker players that he finds online

163
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
So you just said

164
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,559
Five hundred bucks to a dude named chip tracker that you've never seen in your life

165
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Yeah probably like half a

166
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
Deals I do like I never meet the person

167
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Yeah

168
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
So this is part of the game behind the game

169
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
Poker tournaments are really expand

170
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,895
A lot of the players you see on TV they are not playing with their own money

171
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
Even really good players

172
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
Most the time I enter a tournament

173
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
They're going to lose

174
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
And even if they do win

175
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,087
Only a few people going to win the really big

176
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
Poker tournaments are

177
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
Sort of a recipe

178
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
Fever burning through a lot of

179
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:58,047
Being a professional poker player is like having a job where you get paid once

180
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
Every 10 years

181
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,143
And when you do get paid it's a lot of money it's

182
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
10 years worth of money

183
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
But there are a lot of

184
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Meantime

185
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,567
Before that that's why poker players like Derek spread their risk around a lot

186
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,639
Instead of just making one giant bat on themselves

187
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,199
They make all these other little bits to

188
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,783
Buying shares in other players can get expensive

189
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
So there's another thing

190
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
The trade shares of the

191
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,647
Hotels with other players

192
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,207
Before the Tournament begins Derek does this to

193
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
It's a simple system

194
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
He finds a guy he wants

195
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
Trade with and they make a deal

196
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,863
I'll give him 5% of whatever I win

197
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
And he'll give me 5% of whatever he wins

198
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
For this tournament Derek made

199
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
5 swap

200
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
I swapped with

201
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
My friends chardin

202
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Max

203
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Jake RJ and

204
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Indonesia

205
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
They're all Vipers

206
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
These are all handshake deals by the way

207
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
No contract

208
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
Normally yo-yo planet

209
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,551
Like a day in advance so disliked message your friends

210
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
Like make sure you guys are on the same page with

211
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
The swaps

212
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,719
But sometimes you'll just see you like a friend you haven't seen in awhile in the hallway and be like oh yeah

213
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
What's waffle bit

214
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:06,143
Deal just send a text message and say hey if you win $8000000 I'll get 5% of it right you're cool then I'm cool that like

215
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
That's it

216
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,191
Yep that's it

217
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,799
Derek says you only really want to swap percentages with someone who's as good as you

218
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,127
Has someone ever asked you to swapping your like I don't know I'm sorry I think

219
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Not so good

220
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:21,759
At 1 move is like someone asks you to swap you don't really want to hear like real like swap 1/4

221
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
There's a lot of ways you could deal with

222
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
The situation

223
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,439
But you can just say oh sorry I'm swapped out I've already swapped

224
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
With so many people

225
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
You know and it's not a big deal

226
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,071
Derek is not the only one doing all this swapping a

227
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
And buying and selling by

228
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
He estimates that something like

229
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,703
Half of the players in this tournament have sold a percentage of

230
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,263
And even more than that or swapping p

231
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,615
I would say basically every professional is swapping

232
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
And this

233
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,943
Can we do some awkward situations

234
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
Like what if Derek and Chip Chuck

235
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
End up sitting next to me

236
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,599
Why would Derek Titanic ship Tracker out that hurts

237
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Damn that's his invest

238
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
Did it ever happen to you end up

239
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,767
At at the same table with somebody to swap shares with are you you own shares of

240
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
Yeah that happens all the time

241
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
And

242
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
Yeah as long as you have liked

243
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
Small percentage of them it's not really a big deal

244
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,287
But I mean it's only like in the business world or in the professional world or

245
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
In the world

246
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
We would call this

247
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
A conflict of

248
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
Yeah it is definitely a conflict of interest and

249
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
You don't want to

250
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
You don't want to cheat the other players basically

251
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
I asked a lot of poker players about this

252
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
Anniversary outside

253
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Yeah

254
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
This could be a problem

255
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,095
But this point the shares players have in each other

256
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
Pretend to be pretty small

257
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,215
And there's just not a way to help out the other guy without hurting your own chances

258
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
Either they get my chips or I get my check

259
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
You can't have it both ways

260
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,711
This is a tournament for everyone and everyone is here prose amateur

261
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
Dreamers

262
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:03,647
This is the scene when the tournament starts their three giant rooms in the Rio Casino poker tables as far as

263
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
As you can see there are six

264
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
How old in people playing in this term

265
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,071
Can hear the sound of the chips in the room

266
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:16,447
Derek is we mentioned got knocked out of the tournament on his first date but because of the game behind the game

267
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
He is not out

268
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,775
Between all of the swaps and chairs

269
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,103
He's got a piece of 15 players who are still in the turn

270
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
It is like this little army of Derek's out

271
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
All trying to win him

272
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,111
All right so what's 13 and 1/2 million chip pot they see the tray of space

273
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
Bev's on the river

274
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
The tournament keeps going

275
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
Day one day two day three

276
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,815
Derek's Army of players gets knocked out one after the other

277
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
By the middle of day for

278
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
Eric's only got four players left

279
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
Then ship tracker goes down

280
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Batman child

281
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:56,383
141 pros and amateurs continue on day 5 then case

282
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
Swell gets knocked out

283
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
Derek is only got one chance

284
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Left in this

285
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
One player he is now pinning all of

286
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Hope sign

287
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
Jake

288
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Jake

289
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,463
The 21 year old kids sleeping on the couch the one whose friends chipped in throat

290
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Play the tournament

291
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
They won with defense

292
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
Becky went pretty well

293
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,887
And then from day 3 and on I was just like running very very good

294
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
Over the course of that week

295
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,751
I did the guy somehow start treating you any differently

296
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,335
They let me move into the master bedroom from the couch

297
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,431
Definitely moved up in the world

298
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,319
The guys who paid for Jake to play they decide they need to take better care of their vest

299
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
So get some ass

300
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Master bedroom

301
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
And whatever else you want

302
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Derek says

303
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:44,767
If Jake wanted something to drink at the poker table you like fancy juices

304
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
One of the guys would bring it to

305
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,631
I know definitely one of his request at the time was Naked Juice

306
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
We we did a lot of that

307
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,543
I'd like the green kind of the fruit kind yeah I'm not sure

308
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
And Jake just keeps winning

309
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
And hanging around

310
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
Now back to balsiger

311
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,527
Running deep in this 21 year olds first-ever main event he makes a 2 million straight

312
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
And hanging around

313
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:14,207
Turn on Jake Paul's I got the twenty-one-year-old coming off his junior year at Arizona State for the raise to a half million

314
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
Hanging around

315
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,559
And windows 6598

316
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Players finally get window down

317
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,143
29 players

318
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,191
The final table of the tournament

319
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,495
You know who still wasn't knocked out

320
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
Getting to be one of the nine players at the final table

321
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,943
Table is a big deal

322
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
Poker players try their whole lives to get there

323
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,855
And Jake makes it the first year he's even legally allowed inside the casino

324
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
5 minutes

325
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,695
The literal best feeling there as you know like

326
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,767
During the entire time you're just on like complete Cloud 9

327
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,607
The final table is played in this theater with a thousand or two thousand seats

328
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,447
Jake is wearing the same blue plaid shirt he wore for everyday

329
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
It's really cool environment very high energy you know people like Siri

330
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
People are just getting Fairy like

331
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,223
John Kerry net sports game on me

332
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:14,623
At that table Jake looks really really young like they let this skinny teenager

333
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
Turn off the street

334
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,743
Behind him his whole crew is wearing the same blue plaid shirts that Jacob

335
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
Derek is there of course

336
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:26,143
Right in the front row on the rail when you're the rail and you have a piece of someone that's

337
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,775
Personally I get a lot more nervous than when I'm playing I'm just like sitting there and I have no control

338
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
So it's like you're gambling

339
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,127
Yeah exactly and I mean

340
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,247
Like when your guy like gets all in and you just like watching on the sidelines yet

341
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
Yeah it's really intense

342
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,183
The clock about the strike midnight on Jake wall stickers Fairy Tail all right now to turn Park

343
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,607
That's earring you can probably hear Derek in

344
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,959
After hours and hours of play the nine players get whittled down to four

345
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
And Jake

346
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,055
Skinny little Jake is still there holding his own

347
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,383
Jake gets all in against another player Russell Thomas

348
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:15,039
Ace King 4 Paws eres 9 off for Thomas and this could be the end of our evening

349
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,879
Jake wins the hand and takes Russell out of the tournament

350
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:25,279
Knockout

351
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
That's as far as our player Jake

352
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
And our investor Derek

353
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,847
Many many many hours later

354
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
Jay gets knocked out himself

355
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
He takes third

356
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,199
But you know what you get with third place

357
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
A lot of money

358
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:51,647
You're out in third place winning almost four million dollars

359
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
Not telling you on TV

360
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,511
Is that Jake is not taking home $4000000

361
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
He's taking home

362
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
Volundr 700000

363
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
The rest of it

364
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
Is going to his buddies who invested in him

365
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,471
After the tournament ends Jaguars his friends their share

366
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
For Derek

367
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Jake Reitz

368
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,567
Personal check for $600,000

369
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,359
On a Hello Kitty check

370
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,431
Hello Kitty checkbook

371
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
I thought it was funny

372
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
With his share of the money

373
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Jake

374
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Goes

375
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Big

376
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
The only two like

377
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,671
Possessions I remember buying

378
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
Where a bed frame from Ikea

379
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,535
Because I've been sleeping just like on the mattress on the floor

380
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
I bought

381
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
A hammock on Amazon for like

382
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
I want to pay $120

383
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
Derek investor who watched the whole tournament

384
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
From the sidelines

385
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,311
He took home almost as much as Jake

386
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
$600,000

387
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
Dad took that money

388
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
And reinvested

389
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,247
Derek still plays tournaments but more and more this is what he's doing

390
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,783
Buying up shares in a

391
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
Other players

392
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,343
Are you a better investor or better poker

393
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Definitely

394
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
Better investor I think

395
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
There's a lot of

396
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
Really good poker players

397
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,583
But there's not that many people who do as much investing as me

398
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,887
Derek knows a lot about poke

399
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:12,543
How's the math he knows if you need an ace or a 10 to come on the last card you got a 17.4% chance

400
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
Knowing the odds is his job

401
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
And for him

402
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,175
The other best when he is betting on other people

403
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
Instead of playing himself

404
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,783
That was our story in mm

405
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831

414
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,799
Hey it's Keith here in 2019

415
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,847
It's now been six and a half years

416
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,407
Jake won all that money at the World Series

417
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
And it turned out

418
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
He was not beginner's luck

419
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
Jake has gone on to become a

420
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,599
I'm a professional poker player P does not need his friends to buy him into tournaments anymore

421
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
Now he is one of the pros at folks like Derek

422
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
Are super eager to swap with

423
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
And Eric

424
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Still invest

425
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
I called him up on Skype to find out what

426
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,655
Hey Keith how's it going

427
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,983
Derek reports he is still making good money as a poker investor

428
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,543
But now that he's got more money to invest

429
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
He started running into a problem

430
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
Last year it was to the point where

431
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,943
I can put in as much as I even wanted to

432
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
I could see you

433
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
A player whose

434
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,551
Really great in an amazing tournament but

435
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
He only has

436
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,879
Like 20% available for sale

437
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Derek is learning

438
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:37,279
Poker investing is hard to scale-up Optimal strategy for me would to be like

439
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
Okay I want to put 5000 into that

440
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,887
What's that something that you could do with like

441
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
Stocks or

442
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,983
Real estate maybe but not poker

443
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,311
Don't feel too bad for Derek though he's still a poker player

444
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
And a really good one

445
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
Last February

446
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,943
He made the final table of this big tournament in Los an

447
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
It was $1000000 up top

448
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,319
And ended up getting third place in the end

449
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
For about

450
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
430000

451
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,207
Jake decided not to play that

452
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,535
So the 5% swap they normally would have done

453
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Didn't happen

454
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
That seems like I was a mistake on his part

455
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,423
Is very unlucky for Jake

456
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
I did

457
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
Offer to help Derek with his investing

458
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,543
Problem after all I've been having

459
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
All the success at the lowest

460
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,383
Is possible limits in Atlantic City

461
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
I have been

462
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,711
Brushing the ones who game at the Borgata

463
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
Is this the year that you're going to stake me for

464
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Okay the one

465
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,647
Never been to Borgata so that could be outside of my scope

466
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,487
But that's a great start though

467
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:46,399
I feel like all you've done is update your at your way of refusing people that was a mistake

468
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,959
That's outside my scope that's nice

469
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,359
Like any good investor Derek still knows a bad deal when he sees one

470
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:00,223
So instead of finding worse and worst poker players to invest in without his ex

471
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Extra money

472
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
He's Diversified

473
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
He's shifting some of his Focus

474
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
