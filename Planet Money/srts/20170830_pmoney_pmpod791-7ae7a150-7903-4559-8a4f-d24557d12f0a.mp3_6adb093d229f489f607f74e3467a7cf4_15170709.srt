1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,816
Interviewing a spy

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,096
Is very strange

3
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,888
Yes the other day coming I were talking

4
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:06,912
2 John Braddock

5
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,704
Deku with the CIA will not

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,264
Officially confirm or deny

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,032
What's a spy

8
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,568
And he was telling us this story

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,896
That involved his phone I have my phone in my hand

10
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
I check it

11
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,200
Are you looking for anything in particular

12
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
Yeah I check in for messages

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,296
IMessages emails are

14
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,064
Do it what would you like

15
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,880
Yeah I'm looking for

16
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,696
So here we are again

17
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,744
And by here John means

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,280
What's the point in this story

19
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560
Where if you told us

20
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,656
To be fair those are kind of words not John Paddock

21
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:44,800
But of course there are all kinds of spy secrets that the CIA does not want showing up at Planet Money

22
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,592
Unfortunately

23
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,128
We can neither confirm

24
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,688
Nor deny that John Braddock went to some

25
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,248
Formal top secret spy school

26
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:58,368
I can't I can't talk about training we cannot confirm the foreign countries jaundice

27
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,416
Peeking around in rather not

28
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
We also cannot

29
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,024
Confirm the method by which the CIA delivered

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,048
Top secret message

31
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:12,192
Is it get faxed to you do you pick up microfilm under the bench by the 7-Eleven

32
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
Topoint

33
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Eye cancer

34
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,520
Okay the best we got was at

35
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
Tiny detail that we can

36
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,360
Possibly maybe

37
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,176
Seemingly confirm about what it's like to be a spy

38
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
Does that ever involve like

39
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
Climbing a wall with a grappling hook

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
The grappling hook

41
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
Was that

42
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
You know there's

43
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
There's a lot of

44
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,672
Things you're prepared for

45
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
I'll leave it at that

46
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
What

47
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,280
Wait are you saying you may have been trained

48
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,560
On a grappling hook

49
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
Can a male training tok

50
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
Talked about this

51
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:48,032
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm finally home and I'm Kenny Malone

52
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Phone and we're going to level with

53
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,360
You hear there's less than a month of Summer left

54
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,688
And for just one episode we wanted to take a vacation

55
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
From The Economist

56
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,504
And the market and the budget

57
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:03,648
And just talk about spies because who doesn't love spies but the problem is that when you asked

58
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
Buy the big question

59
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
They usually cannot answer

60
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
Sunset today

61
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
We asked

62
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
Little question

63
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
We have three tiny tips from spies

64
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,168
That we found useful and fun

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
None of them about crap

66
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128

74
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
Okay honey

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,768
First tip

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
How to think like a

77
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,888
It comes from John Braddock who you heard from earlier

78
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,984
And he told us a story about when he was a case officer in the CIA

79
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
He was in an undisclosed country

80
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
On an undisclosed

81
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
It was cold out

82
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,688
John Braddock was wearing a trench coat

83
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,528
It was early in the morning around 7 hour

84
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
John's on his way to meet his source

85
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,136
So we head to a subway stop gets onto a train

86
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
And walks to the back of the

87
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
I sit down

88
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:15,328
I don't see anything to be alarmed by I don't see anything even really to take a second look at

89
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
And that's when

90
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
Yeah I pull up my phone

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,288
Maybe John Braddock has some fancy Spy software that makes

92
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,592
Recordings on his cell phone at all times

93
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
But if that's true he didn't share

94
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
This is our own

95
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,016
So just looking down at his phone he's checking to see if his Source has left a message for him

96
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:40,416
And that's when humans let me see your phone very short very abrupt very direct

97
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
John says the words were in the local languages

98
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
Country he cannot disclose

99
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,120
So maybe the guy actually said or

100
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,008
Or anyway it was pretty clear the let me see your phone mint give me your

101
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,568
John looks up and there's a guy standing over him

102
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
Is closer

103
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
Shabby

104
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
Disheveled the phone back

105
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Indusparquet

106
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
Where the guy can grab

107
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,320
I stand up the face and try to move past and he does he moves to block me

108
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,136
John notices the guy's hands are suddenly moving towards

109
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
I look down and Bam

110
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,976
Headbutts

111
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
John

112
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
I fall backwards

113
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Feel sticky

114
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,863
Blood streaming down

115
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
My face

116
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,447
And he standing over me

117
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
Start laughing

118
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,823
Like it's crazy how kind of laugh

119
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
All right

120
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:39,551
So maybe what you just heard sounds like John Braddock getting caught off guard and then

121
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Getting beat

122
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
But there is a tip in there

123
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
If you could look inside John's head

124
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,743
He is actually using a structured

125
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
System of things

126
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,095
John calls it the DEA DEA Loop

127
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
It's an acronym

128
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
Starts with Gathering

129
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
Data

130
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,287
Data feeds into analysis which feeds into a decision which feeds into an action

131
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
DEA

132
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
DEA data

133
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Analysis

134
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Decision

135
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
Action

136
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
That's what makes it a loop

137
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
You do it over and over

138
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,015
And it's based on a similar Loop

139
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
Invented by a famous military strategy

140
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,879
And it's it's a way to stay focused

141
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,183
To slow down a stressful situation

142
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
And really see what happened

143
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
So if I were being attacked on a train

144
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
I would be thinking of some big

145
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,887
Situation ending actions

146
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
Runaway

147
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Throw a punch

148
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Scream

149
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
But John

150
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
He's not thinking

151
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
So again

152
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,103
He's in that train car sitting down

153
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
Pulls out his phone

154
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
And here's that

155
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Let me see your phone

156
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
What's an expat

157
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
Does he know I'm a spy

158
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,551
That would be the worst

159
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Case scenario

160
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
This is an enemy spy

161
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
An assassin

162
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,975
So John rapidly does this Loop he goes to find the things

163
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
Vicki needs to answer

164
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
That question

165
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
Because too much data

166
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
Is a bad thing

167
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
To scan the car

168
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
And something catches his eye on the tree

169
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
There is a camera

170
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
In the roof

171
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Of the carriage

172
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Despise hate

173
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Surveillance

174
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
You're going to confront another spy

175
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,127
KLM Steelers phone

176
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
Very unlikely

177
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
You do it well

178
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,015
John also notices something about the attacker himself

179
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,831
He's either dancing a little bit he's not

180
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
Focused

181
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
He doesn't look

182
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
Prepare for this moment

183
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
Data collected analysis

184
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,791
Has done this is not a spy trying to kill John and steal his phone

185
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
This is probably a Mugger on drugs

186
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
So when you realized that are you relieved

187
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
I don't

188
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:36,031
Don't think I have an emotional reaction it's not really relief as much as it is

189
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Okay

190
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,895
It's a different situation very bad situation

191
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,991
Because John cannot afford to lose a cell phone that might have sensitive information on

192
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
Alright so data and Analysis

193
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Action yet

194
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
And there is an obvious one

195
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
We could take

196
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:57,535
John is not a small guy he has had extensive training that may or may not have involved grappling hook anime not

197
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
She could probably handle

198
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
A drugged up mugger without too much

199
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
Trouble

200
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
But if he showed up

201
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
In surveillance camera footage

202
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
Fighting like he is James Bond

203
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
Or Jason Bourne

204
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
That is very bad

205
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
For the bigger game

206
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
We're trying to stay under cover

207
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
In a foreign car

208
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,199
It's an easy thing to always think

209
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
That

210
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
The guy

211
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,599
Across the table from you who may pull out a gun is

212
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:28,255
Is your greatest enemy because the thread is to immediate it starts to look very

213
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Different from the movie

214
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:34,911
Because John does not knock his attacker out he doesn't pull out some crazy weapons I'm crazy Gadget

215
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:40,287
The action that his meticulous decision-making process led him to in that moment

216
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
Was this

217
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,871
I put my phone in my pocket and I stood up

218
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
He stood up

219
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
He was sitting

220
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
And then he was not

221
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
Does that even count

222
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,319
Incredibly boring action but in a very tiny way

223
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,647
It does change the situation then we're face to face

224
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
You standing

225
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
And their face

226
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:03,583
If you are really good at this. Loop you can see these almost imperceptible changes in a situation

227
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
So now John's immediately back up

228
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
How to start Gathering data

229
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Observes the mug

230
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Girls reaction

231
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,031
To his bold move of standing up

232
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,567
The mugger is unfair

233
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
Now John knows

234
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
This isn't going

235
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
And he has another decision to make

236
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
Another action to take

237
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Again

238
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
I moved to the side

239
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
He moves to the side to block me

240
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
To the conflict

241
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
Not going to let John runaway order

242
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
The Escalade

243
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
And now John sees the muggers

244
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,047
Hand moving towards I look down

245
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
Laugh like a supervillain and walks away

246
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
That John did not exact

247
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,007
We choose to get head-butted and bleed all over his nice trench coat and

248
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
And shirt

249
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,335
But he did choose over and over

250
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Not

251
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
To act or at least not to

252
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
Over

253
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,735
And eventually a solution did resent itself

254
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,807
For whatever reason the mugger walked away without

255
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
The phone

256
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,391
And in this case that is what winning looks like

257
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
It's not some big active

258
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,023
Courage it's not even blocking an incoming headbutt

259
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
It's seeing what's important

260
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
And sometimes

261
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
Losing the small game

262
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
To win the big

263
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
Soospy tip number one when something

264
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
Unexpected happened and

265
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
You feel yourself jumping to

266
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Take a big action

267
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Remember the loop

268
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,151
Do the loop data analysis

269
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
Decision action

270
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
How to win the more important

271
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,039
John hightailed it out of the trains

272
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,855
Gash on his head blood running down

273
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
His face but

274
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Phone

275
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Still in his

276
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:37,279
His pocket and made it to a hospital and was already too

277
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
Explain

278
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
To a doctor what happened

279
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,887
How to fix story all cooked up about

280
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
The head wound to the hospital

281
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,983
Make him report the mugging to the police

282
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,823
And John says he was also ready to refuse general anesthetic

283
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,639
You also don't want to do that in foreign country

284
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
Why is that

285
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,271
Well if you don't want anybody to put you on there and make you incapacitated when you hear

286
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
When you're a spy

287
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
That's bad for business

288
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
I guess that's true that we actually may have learned

289
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
I want to get the truth serum

290
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,303
There you go extra have to promise five

291
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
Don't go under anesthesia in a foreign car

292
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:19,007
Bonus tip for other spots

293
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,639
Art can you hear can you hear us I can hear you how about a little bit low

294
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
Tiny spy chip number two

295
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
Comes from art

296
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
Color this one is about how to

297
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
Spot danger like

298
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:36,927
Art color is a former officer in the cia's counter-proliferation division

299
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,743
Proliferation of nuclear weapons technology

300
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Frontier track down terrorist

301
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
I was telling us about

302
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
How when you're in the field

303
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Undercover

304
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
And you're in a foreign car

305
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
Having to ask

306
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,775
Act like a criminal for want of a better word

307
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
Because you're trying to do something or not

308
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,151
That means you got to always be aware of your surroundings

309
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,223
Surveillance cameras of course foreign police officers

310
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
But the

311
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,807
You need to look out for even more

312
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
Then police are laps

313
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
Locks

314
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
L o p

315
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,207
It's an acronym spies

316
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,791
Really love acronyms and here's what it does not say

317
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,959
It does not stand for laser operated projectiles does not stand for latent opioid

318
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
Food poisoning

319
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Lots

320
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Are far more Danger

321
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
And that was the acronym for little old people

322
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Little

323
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Old peep

324
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
And man are they Lethal lethal

325
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Little old boy

326
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
Because lops

327
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Have nothing to do

328
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,391
They sit around they look out their window and they look for

329
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Suspicious activity in

330
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,695
In their neighborhood

331
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
There's a famous

332
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,511
Cautionary tale about this

333
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
And I want to say 1998

334
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
In Switzerland

335
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:52,191
Art says there was a team of alleged Israeli spies trying to break into a house

336
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
And place a bug

337
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
And some little lady

338
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
Was up at 2 a.m. and just

339
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
Tearing out their window and you know it was like

340
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,967
What's this group of suspicious people and they call the cops on them and you know then you get an international incident

341
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
It was nothing

342
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,575
International thing sewart says if you are a spy

343
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
The trick is that lot

344
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
Are not to be under a

345
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
But

346
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
You could also look at it another way

347
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
Not a spy

348
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Looking to buy a house

349
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,071
Home lops make great Neighbors

350
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:25,471
The Earth has you should let him organizer neighborhood watch and

351
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
You know

352
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,823
They will let their fingers do the walking in and and make the report

353
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
Our last tip

354
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
Comes from Mary Louise

355
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,479
She's not a spy she's our colleague here

356
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
NPR but you just cover spies

357
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
Does the CIA

358
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
And she spends lots of time

359
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Talking

360
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Intelligence

361
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Picking up there

362
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Although

363
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
Sadly they get all the cool Gadget

364
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
Disappointed to know I do now

Or have any disguises arf

368
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
Passports are all the fun stuff

369
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,287
But she does have a tip that you could jump on the job

370
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
This past weekend

371
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,711
We asked her to record it just pulling into the grocery store and the Kroger parking

372
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:14,111
Looking for a spot because we are out of

373
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,511
You disguise letting me go in front of him cuz he's

374
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:25,887
Cuz I do not pull straight it Mary Louise Kelly

375

Always

377
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
Beck's

378
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
Into her pocket

379
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,799
