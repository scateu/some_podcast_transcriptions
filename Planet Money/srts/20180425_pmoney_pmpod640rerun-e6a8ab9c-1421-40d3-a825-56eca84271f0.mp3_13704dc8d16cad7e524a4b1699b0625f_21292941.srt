Hey everyone just a quick note this show is a rerun

16
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,672
It was originally reported in 2015 when California was suffering through a long

17
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
Fierce trout

18
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,768
At the end of the show will give you an update on where things stand now

19
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,352
The drought in California has made life

20
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,888
Inconvenient for a lot of

21
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,656
People there

22
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,424
In a lot of way

23
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,472
If you hear about people not being watched

24
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,240
The cars

25
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
In the brown lawn

26
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,824
People taking slightly shorter showers

27
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,384
Are there places where people

28
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
Hats

29
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,688
Where they get their water

30
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,224
Are actually running

31
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,808
Dry where you go to the faucet turn it on and nothing comes out

32
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,880
And that is happening in a city called Porterville California

33
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,928
It's about an hour south of Fresno

34
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,976
The used to get their water from

35
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
Wells

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
Outfit supplied their homes

37
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,072
And the wells aren't deep enough

38
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
To reach the water ending

39
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,888
And their taps

40
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,704
Actually went drive to have no water in their house

41
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,776
So what are they do how do they get water just to live their daily life

42
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:20,896
The city has set up these kind of temporary facilities portable showers and sinks

43
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,456
I went and visited one it was in the parking lot

44
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,224
Epic Church

45
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,040
And the kind of look like an airplane bathroom

46
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,856
They had little benches and shower heads and a curtain

47
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
And out in the

48
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,464
The blazing hot afternoon sun or Rose of sinx

49
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
With mirrors

50
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,280
A people come there in the morning and shaved

51
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
Before work

52
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,632
It was a really grim and while I was walking around

53
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,192
A car pulled up and Karen Hendrickson roll

54
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
Window down

55
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,288
So what were you hoping to get today water today

56
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
Pourhouse the drinking water

57
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:55,456
Is our well is dry so you come here for support on drinking water

58
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,296
How long ago did your well go dry it's been a year already

59
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,600
Wow it's been a year

60
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,184
The city is helping Karen out it dropped a big

61
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,304
Tank of water off at her house it's it's right next door house on the school stand and they fill it up

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,328
A couple times a month

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,704
So Karen can take showers but the water is not drinkable Karen can't wash her dishes

64
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,776
She's with it so she has to come here a few times a week

65
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Wait to pick up

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
Bottled water whatever has been donated for her household

67
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,152
My daughter she has twins

68
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
Oh baby twins

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
A boy and a girl

70
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,576
Yeah that must be hard with no water

71
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,136
How often do you come here

72
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,952
At least one couple times a week

73
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
Maya my daughter

74
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,328
She comes in and I come so could we drink a lot of water

75
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
A lot

76
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,936
Karen asked the security guard Jimmy water today

77
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
The security guard says no we're out

78
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
I come back tomorrow

79
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,312
Things heartbreaking about all of this

80
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
Is that there is

81
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
Actually water

82
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Still left

83
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,456
In the valley there is water literally below

84
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
Karen's home there's a giant aquifer

85
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,808
Entering used to tap into it with her well

86
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
But the level is getting lower and lower

87
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,928
And lower so she and her neighbors can't reach anymore

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
It's like this race

89
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
To get the water

90
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Karen

91
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
And the people here locked out of the way

92
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
There are people still getting this water

93
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
People who are still in this

94
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,936
Not that far away from Karen's house

95
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
You see it

96
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,264
Acres and Acres of lush farmland

97
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,336
Corn cotton tomatoes

98
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
Pistachio trees walnuts almonds

99
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:35,040
This is where Karen's water went

100
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:41,440
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith Robert Smith today on the show The screwed up

101
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Economics

102
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,048
Why the most lucrative thing you can do right now in California

103
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,912
Is to use more and more and more of the scarce resource water

104
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,960
Are almonds grown or pistachios

105
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,008
And beat out your competitors

106
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
Sweet sweet water at the bottom of the well

Marquardt Farms 3000 acres in California Central Valley

115
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,991
Mark is a very energetic I super organized

116
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
He likes to pay Bliss to the steering wheel of his truck is that a to-do list on your steering wheel

117
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,791
We're in Mark's truck and we're driving across

118
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
Costas Farm

119
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,375
His field stretch as far as the eye can see

120
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,471
Beautiful black eyed peas and corn and pistachio trees

121
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
It's incredibly Lush and green

122
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,615
And the reason for this is that Mark storm sits on top of that aquifer

123
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
The same aquifer that Karen's house well

124
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,991
Except he's better getting to the water

125
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,783
He is better at getting to the water

126
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,391
But it's getting harder and harder even for Mark the level of the aquifer has been dropping

127
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Really fast

128
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
I'm dropping 10 feet a week

129
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,487
Which term meaning 10ft a week

130
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,327
10 Peter week in fact half of the wheels on his 3000 acres have dried up

131
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
He chose me

132
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
That sucks

133
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
Should be producing water

134
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
It's not

135
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
See if there's any water in it

136
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
This is a good sound you like

137
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,199
Mark fix a rock up off the ground and he throws it into the well pipe sticking out of the ground

138
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,551
You was right I like the sound

139
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
Water

140
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,903
Oh is that with their wife Gloria

141
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
That's what you water down there

142
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
But the pump that was here

143
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,535
Wouldn't reach that water anymore have to deepen it

144
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
Mark is deepening Wells as fast as

145
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
And he's also putting in new well

146
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,703
She's putting 8 at a cost of around $2000000

147
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,775
And the reason for this is all around us

148
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
Pistachio tree

149
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,407
They're little baby ones he's just planted there like up to your hip Titan diesel

150
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Steaks

151
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,247
And there are bigger ones in the next field within clusters

152
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
Of pistachios almonds

153
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
These are the pistachios

154
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
There you can see it's about half developed

155
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
It's a green

156
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,815
These little pistachios are very

157
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Thirsty

158
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,471
It takes almost a gallon of water to grow one pistachio and a gallon of water to grow an almond

159
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,799
Nut trees are some of the thirstiest crops around

160
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
And yet

161
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,127
Here we are in the middle of a drought

162
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,199
And Mark is planning pistachio trees as fast as he can

163
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
Why are you planting

164
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
So many new trees right now

165
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,415
We just think it's financially it's the right decision to make once they get up into production

166
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
How to make good money

167
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,791
So there are they pretty profitable pistachios

168
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,095
I mean what wildly

169
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
Really

170
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:06,495
Actually 10 times more profitable than most other crops

171
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,823
Are pistachios marketing make $10,000 an acre

172
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
The most epic raps

173
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
$1,000

174
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
The reason for this is both Supply

175
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,015
And demand the demand part is that people are eating more nuts

176
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
China and India are

177
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
Discovering them until there's a much bigger Market

178
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
For not spot

179
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,415
Supply-side is awesome

180
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
The reason why they can make so much money

181
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Office Depot

182
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
Crops is

183
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
Cuz of the drow

184
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,375
The drought has made pistachios and almonds

185
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
Harder to grow

186
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
And as a result the price has naturally shot

187
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
So everyone is planting

188
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,823
And when you drive to California Central Valley it's striking

189
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:47,199
All of the fields are these new trees farmers are ripping out their old crops and putting in

190
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,807
And it becomes will probably hear the stories about hedge funds and Big Bang

191
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
Buying California farmland

192
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,903
Implanting almond and pistachio

193
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,767
Because hedge funds and banks have plenty of cash upfront to drill

194
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
These really deep well

195
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
Happy Aquaphor

196
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
Get the water first

197
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
And the path for them could be huge

198
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,263
It's kind of funny to imagine these Bankers looking over Maps

199
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
The California Farmland in deciding what

200
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
Crops to plant

201
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,127
But apparently that's what happened

202
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:21,247
I talked to a scientist at Nasa water scientist his name is James family Eddie

203
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,111
And he told me he's getting calls all the time from Bankers and business people

204
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,439
Asking him is this a good time to get into the nut growing

205
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,255
People ask me about it all the time and

206
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,327
I do feel a conflict I generally don't respond

207
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:40,447
I don't want to encourage someone to go make a short term investment that would that would use up a lot of water

208
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,239
That's just my own personal bias

209
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,799
So it is a smart short-term Investments

210
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,871
Of course my time there's a dwindling resource

211
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,223
Right if you can if you can get it to the market sure of course

212
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
And this right here is the problem in California right now

213
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
When you have a scarce resource like water

214
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,159
The right thing to do from a public policy perspective

215
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,743
Is to find ways to conserve it right to make sure there is enough water

216
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
For everyone that's the right

217
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:10,911
But the market incentive is to use as much water as possible before your neighbors

218
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
You should plant nuts

219
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
Wildmutt prices are high that's

220
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,031
Basic economic logic

221
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Go go go

222
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,359
And this is being reinforced by the market right now

223
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,663
Because crops that do well in droughts

224
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
They do not bring in that

225
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
Much money and if you're running a farm and spending hundreds of thousand

226
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
Dollars to drill new wells

227
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,855
You are not going to make that money back

228
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,647
Planting drought-friendly crops

229
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,695
Iran the Spy Mark wipes

230
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
I mean should you be planning something like

231
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,815
Flaxseed or safflower here instead of

232
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Pistachio trees

233
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Isis

234
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
Should I be planting

235
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
I don't know I mean

236
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,127
We're trying to make money here

237
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Economist have a term

238
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,247
For this race for scarce resource this dilemma

239
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,575
And you probably heard it even if you haven't taken economics classes called

240
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
The tragedy of the commons

241
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:07,999
If you have a shared resource say a meadow where your cows graze or an underground Lake

242
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:13,375
People will use as much of it as they can't they will use a public resource until it's gone

243
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
And the reason that they call this

244
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
The tragedy is not that there are any

245
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,311
Bad guys in the scenario is it actually everybody is acting rationally

246
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:26,175
It's just that what is good for the individual and what is good for the group are totally different

247
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,271
Take more qualities of statue farmer if he were to cut back his water use

248
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
He would just lose out

249
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,111
His neighbors would use the water hedge funds would you

250
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,511
He's the water they would make the $10,000 an acre and he would be stuck with a bunch of safflower that's not worth very much

251
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,607
Drilling deeper and his neighbor's look at that invade Realty for 2

252
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
And this race this race were talking about because

253
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,031
Testing in this race you got to pick up the phone and call somebody like Steve Arthur

254
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
So do you mind reading the back of your truck

255
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,919
That just says Arthur and Orum well drilling Fresno

256
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
We leave you at

257
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
That's amazing

258
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,855
That's amazing is always what I say when I don't know what to

259
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,231
Arthur runs one of the biggest drilling companies in the area

260
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
And he actually mostly works out of

261
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,839
Hebrides it from real site to drill site all day

262
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,423
I get 40 or 50 calls a day easy

263
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
I can't even keep track of what the office gif

264
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
All the farmers are

265
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
Completely running out of water

266
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,383
So how long is the wait to get a well-drilled

267
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,199
Realistically

268
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
At least a year

269
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,807
Wells around here used to be about 200

270
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,671
But these days Steve is drilling Wells that are as much as to

271
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Thousand

272
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
His company has started buying equipment off of oil drilling company

273
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,887
He's like fracking companies in order to get deep enough to get to the water

274
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,983
Years ago nobody had equipment in the area to go that deep

275
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,799
And modern technology

276
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
Taking care of that now so

277
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,967
We started drilling deeper up there that's what we found aquifers nobody's ever touch

278
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,855
And you know how this app to go deeper and deeper you take more and more water out of an aqua

279
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
Eventually

280
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
It is going to go away

281
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
And when we talked to the water scientist we asked him

282
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
How much is left at the space and he said

283
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Maybe

284
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,911
50 years 50 years worth of water in the aquifer at the outside

285
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,263
And when I asked him what would happen when the water ran out what that would look like

286
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
He actually reference the movie

287
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
Mad Max

288
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
Asking people driving around

289
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
The desert

290
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
Fighting each other for water

291
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Thunderdome

292
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,015
Because that is one of the logical ways that

293
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
This app the water

294
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:44,927
Goes away the wells go dry and all the sudden knowing Chris pistachios anymore no one grows anything

295
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
We're talking about functionally a dust bowl happen

296
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
In the Central Valley

297
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,095
Another ending could be regulation

298
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,143
Government steps in and says hey

299
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
You have to limit your water use you can only drill this deep

300
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,775
But so far the state has been reluctant to do

301
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,359
There is one other option that one solution to

302
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
The tragedy of the commons

303
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,783
In fact there's an economist named Ellen arrastra we've talked about her here before I'm Planet Money she won a Nobel Prize for her

304
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
Work on the tragedy of the commons

305
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
In 2009

306
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,159
And her work showed that sometimes this does not end badly

307
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,255
And somebody doesn't end in the government coming in putting on these rules and regulations

308
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,327
She said that people can come together

309
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,399
And work out a solution for themselves they can basically

310
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
Put the interests of their group

311
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,727
Ahead of their immediate

312
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Sort of

313
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Decide not

314
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
Trace but this is not easy as you can imagine because basically you have to convince people to give up their personal short

315
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
Interest for the long-term interests of the

316
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:45,087
And this is not exactly how humans are built this is just not what we tend to do next

317
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
But

318
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,159
I did manage to find some peace

319
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:52,255
People who are trying it north of Marchetti's pistachio Farm in a town near sacrum

320
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,791
Their story

321
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559

Hi my name is Jorge Heartland

330
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
I'm an attorney

331
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
Lawyer

332
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
In Texas

333
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
They call us Liars

334
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,375
George has been working with farmers in this area

335
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:34,239
His whole career when we looked around he saw the same things happening there as what's happening down south

336
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,591
The community was running out of water everyone was using as much as they could as fast

337
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
And he thought to himself

338
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,455
This race that's happening is going to end

339
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,271
We should get together and try to stop it

340
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
Because sooner or later

341
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
The government

342
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
We'll come in and when our water use

343
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
We don't know when and we don't know

344
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
How much

345
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,255
So he got a group of farmers together about 500 of them

346
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
In Stockton California

347
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
And he said within I have a proposal

348
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
Why don't we voluntarily cut our water use

349
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
25%

350
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
And if we do that

351
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,799
The government has said it will not come in later and

352
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
What are water

353
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
This way

354
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
You got certainty

355
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,687
You know what you can do you can play in your survival

356
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,759
Which must have been hard for the farmers there because basically

357
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
In this community

358
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Water

359
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,927
Is Muddy Water meant crops crops me money and he's basically coming in and saying to them

360
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
I want you to take a

361
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
25%

362
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
A lot of the farmers really didn't want to do that

363
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,143
There were a lot of folks who thought it was extortion

364
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
They didn't like it

365
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
But Indian

366
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,055
Half of the farmers signed up to do this and Paula does Nair was one of the

367
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
It's costly

368
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,407
It's not ideal for this is your livelihood

369
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,479
Pilot was a dairy farm in Lodi California

370
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,527
And she grows a lot of corn for her cows

371
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
Or her girls

372
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
As she calls them

373
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
Using 25% less water will mean pilot will have to

374
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
Buy a lot of the

375
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
Cows and that is a lot more expensive

376
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,303
And that means the best all is going to be able to do this year

377
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
Is breaking

378
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,143
But part of the deal because she's been hearing all of the

379
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,215
These horror stories about her neighbors getting their water cut off

380
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,799
Entirely as in the government coming in and saying no more water

381
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
And the farmers are stuck

382
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,151
The crops are halfway grown if no water to

383
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
Stilt the decision weighs on her

384
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,855
Is there a feeling of like we're all in this together I don't know is there that feeling at all

385
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,415
I think I felt that way that I want to do what I

386
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,975
And you want to do what your part

387
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:37,631
You want to make I hope that everyone is doing their part because it is it is

388
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
Financial burden

389
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,775
You can hear her anxiety in that laugh because this particular solution to the

390
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
Tragedy of the commons

391
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
Can be brutal

392
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
If it turns out that the government

393
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,407
Does not put any new rule

394
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
Who plays the government does not

395
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
Make you cut back on your water

396
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,783
Then you just giving up your profits

397
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
For nothing

398
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,599
But you will feel like a chump

399
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
You cut back

400
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
And perhaps

401
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:05,535
Your neighbors didn't do it the same time perhaps baked at drinking water while you alone cut back

402
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,863
And maybe you get to drink more water because you gave up a big portion

403
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Of yours

404
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,959
George Hartman the water lawyer told me this is his biggest

405
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,031
What are you going to say to the folks who took the hit

406
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
And

407
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,663
I don't know I think the answer is you pays your money and you takes your chances that's

408
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Really what it is

409
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,271
And if it turns out that you would have done better

410
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,087
Not being in program okay

411
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
But

412
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
Do you want to bet the farm on it

413
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
The farmer started cutting back last month and so far people seem to be sticking to it and it's gotten a lot of people asking

414
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
Could this work in other parts

415
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
California

416
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
Is this possibly a solution to the drought

417
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,287
I put this question to Mark Whitey the pistachio farmer with the dry Wells

418
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,615
I asked the farmers in his area might come together in the same way

419
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,967
Would something like that work here is like everybody got together and agreed to

420
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
Use

421
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
Last

422
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
You mean as far as

423
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,135
Don't pump as much or something like that

424
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
I just

425
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
How come

426
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
I don't know I just

427
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
A group of

428
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,543
Number one you could you couldn't get consensus

429
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,871
If you had fought only five Farmers I don't think you could get consensus

430
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,943
If you got 500 Farmers I know you couldn't get a consent

431
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,503
So I just don't think it would be effective

432
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Google thing to try

433
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
I mean right now

434
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
You know you just

435
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,623
Did there is water down there

436
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
And you got Haves and Have Nots

437
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
And the haves

438
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,767
I don't think we'll be in a mood to share with the Have Nots

439
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Sohi eye

440
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,447
This was another thing that Elinor Ostrom the Nobel Prize winner

441
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,495
Discovered in her work on the tragedy

442
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
The commons

443
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,079
For a group to solve this problem on its own

444
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
The group needs to be small

445
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
That group Upstate with the dairy farm

446
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:02,271
They were fighting over surface-water local rivers and dams it was a smaller community

447
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,855
The aquifer has thousands and thousands of farmers

448
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,647
With their well sticking down into it

449
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,511
Imagine trusting them all. To take an extra sip from the aquifer just a little

450
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
The night no one will notice

451
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:18,143
And the government has been making some moves to regulate the drilling and the groundwater

452
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,703
But those regulations won't be in place until twenty

453
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,287
Until then the water level in the aquifer is expected

454
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
To keep dropping

455
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
Wells will keep drying up

456
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Marquardt

457
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,919
The pistachio farmer drove me to one of his Wells

458
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,711
It's just about to go dry

459
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
Hello this is a

460
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
Pump that has a

461
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,111
Put in service in 1946

462
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
It has Faithfully produced water

463
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
And it is now

464
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,511
Surging which means the

465
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,351
The equipment is lifting the water is right at

466
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,423
The level of where the water level is

467
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,543
And I expect a week from now it will not be functioning anymore until we dry

468
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
So

469
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,871
It's just a

470
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,711
Another one that has is going to go by the wayside here quickly

471
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
What is it

472
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
Feel like to see it

473
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
Doing that

474
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
I purposely don't drive by it

475
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,415
And when I do I look the other way

476
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:19,071
As I was driving around the farm with Mark I kept asking him over and over why he's doing what he

477
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,631
Why he keeps drilling deeper and deeper well

478
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
And why he keeps at the same time

479
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,007
Planting crops that need so much water what is the future here

480
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
And he told me there is still a lot of water left

481
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,895
Is Aquaphor and he thinks things will turn around he

482
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
Kept telling me

483
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
It's going to rain next

484
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,759
It's going to rain next year and he might very well rain next

485
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
You're not that's going to replenish

486
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,831
The aquifer but it could make things

487
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
Slightly better

488
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,671
I think in order to be a farmer anywhere at anytime

489
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
You have to have the

490
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
This optimism

491
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
Maybe things will be better next

492
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,047
Maybe there will be more water

493
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,863
Maybe there's a small chance he's right

494
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,703
Or maybe that's just what you tell yourself while the tragedy plays out

495
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,199
And now for a quick update

496
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,271
Beer after we reported the story California Farmers

497
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,343
Did catch a break they got a year of record-setting rainfall

498
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
They barely needed to tap their underground aquifers at all

499
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,720
This year though things have been dry again

500
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,024
And some of those farmers will go back to pumping

501
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
Draining that shared Lake

502
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
Groundwater

503
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
But they also know it's about to change

504
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,704
2 years from now a new law is set to go into effect

505
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,752
Orders Farmers to stop

506
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
Draining their aqua

507
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,080
No more digging ever deeper well

508
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,896
Farmers will only be allowed to pump as much water out

509
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
As rainfall quits

510
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
It does regulations work

511
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,808
20 years from now when you drop a stone into a well in California

512
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,880
It shouldn't take much longer to hit the water than it does today

513
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,280
As always we love to hear what you think

514
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:58,144
The program emails Planet Money on NPR. Org or you can tweet us at Planet Money

515
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,544
Today's episode was originally produced by Francis Harlow and Jess Jiang the rerun was produced by Alexi Horowitz Ghazi

516
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Robert Smith

517
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
And I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

518
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,712
Thanks for listening
