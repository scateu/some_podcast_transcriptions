Mr. pool can I ask you a question I've been bothering your daughter

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,808
What do you think about all this Georgetown stuff

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,624
Logo Ford

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,904
If he

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,000
Whole lot of people want to do the right thing ain't got another whole lot

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,816
They want money off the DNA

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
You don't want money

13
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
Why not

14
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
I got money

15
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:48,640
What about that are about no money

16
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,944
But not everyone agrees with Bernie old pool

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,248
His town and his family are divided

18
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,344
On last week's show we went to the town of maringouin Louisiana

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
About a year ago many residents of Marin Gwen learns that they're the descendants of 272 people

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,512
Slaves

21
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,816
Who were sold in 1838

22
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,584
Pay a debt

23
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
The debt was owed by Georgetown University

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,192
The Jesuit college in Washington DC

25
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,776
The Seal of the 272 slaves saved George

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,104
And when all this came out it raised a big question

27
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,408
What is Georgetown The Descendants

28
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,200
An easy answer is

29
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
The past is the past

30
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,016
Georgetown doesn't owe them anything

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
But consider this

32
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,856
Georgetown itself

33
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,136
Believes it owes a debt

34
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,720
Here's Georgetown President John degioia speaking last

35
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,328
Fault he's quoting a working group that Georgetown set up to examine its links to

36
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,632
Did slavery rights quote

37
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
We have also returned frequent

38
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
To the question

39
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
A reparation

40
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
While we acknowledge

41
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
That the moral debt

42
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,152
Of slaveholding in the sale of enslaved people

43
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
Can never be repaid

44
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,784
We are convinced that reparative Justice requires

45
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
A meaningful Financial committee

46
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
From the universe

47
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
Reparations

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,440
Georgetown will study the question

49
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
What do we owe

50
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,536
Now that's Georgetown in Washington DC

51
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,096
I went down there and went to talk to descendants

52
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,424
My very first stop was what you heard at the beginning of the show

53
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,496
The driveway of berneil pools little Brick House

54
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,568
I was surprised by how certain he was

55
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
But he doesn't want anything

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,480
Why not money is important right and your ancestors not even ancestors your

57
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
It would have been your great

58
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,088
Your great-grandfather

59
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
Who was enslaved

60
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
And was sold

61
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,072
Yeah you don't want them to pay then argued money over there and every time I spend out on Messi

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,144
I'm spinning my dead people money

63
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,384
I'm Noel King and today on planet

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,176
Money we're going to talk to descendants

65
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
About what they think they're old

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
About what they accept

67
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,320
I'm going to talk to people who spent their careers

68
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
Trying to figure out

69
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,672
Would eat meaningful Financial commitment might look like

70
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,464
In the face of a moral debt that

71
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
It cannot be repaid

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,072
We're going to talk about reparations

73
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,656

My guide on American was a woman named Deborah till

83
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,752
LG's Mr Poole's daughter

84
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,336
It is a pleasure to meet you to miss Noel

85
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,920
I am excited we met outside her office in Baton Rouge

86
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,016
30 miles west America

87
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
Debra's in her mid-50s

88
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
T-shirt

89
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,368
She's wearing a bracelet that says

90
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
Any spunky little earrings

91
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
With skulls on them

92
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,280
Deborah and I had talked on the phone before I came down so I knew a couple

93
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
First

94
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,911
People in this little town don't all agree on what if anything Georgetown

95
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,495
Second they've been getting a lot of attention from Outsiders

96
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
And 3rd

97
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:33,151
Deborah is trying to have a sense of humor about all this so it's all I've known

98
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,943
We were a Slave

99
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,295
Now I got somebody telling me now I got to start using the term insulin

100
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Well

101
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,903
Slave and slave didn't make the work no easy

102
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
Just like a whipping or whooping

103
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,743
It don't make a difference it still hurts

104
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
Okay

105
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,351
Difference of kind of person who likes making fun of a certain kind

106
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Political correct

107
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,215
She wanted to take me to Marin Gardens monthly town hall meeting

108
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,007
So people would know why I was hanging around

109
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,335
You're a little late getting in so we stood in the back

110
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Overalls

111
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
Emma meeting was typical

112
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
Water

113
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
Sewerage overgrown grass

114
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,807
The chief of police of irritated that people call him at home

115
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,367
Instead of calling the station when they have a problem

116
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:19,231
The mayor brings up that Maryland could really use an adult

117
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255
Literacy Center

118
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
Endeavor starts typing something on her phone

119
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
And she pulls me in

120
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
And she shows it too

121
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
She Wrote

122
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,471
Maybe that's something that Georgetown

123
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
Count to pay for

124
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,847
This is a perfect illustration of how weird this whole thing is

125
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:41,503
A year ago there was no talk of Georgetown University paying for things and little maringouin Louisiana

126
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
People weren't hiring lawyers order

127
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,831
Discussing payment

128
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
They are now

129
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,695
Deborah says she doesn't want anything for herself

130
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,023
But she does want Georgetown to invest in Maryland

131
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
Even though she knows

132
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327
There are no guarantees

133
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
All I can do is ask

134
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
And all I can do is say either yes or no

135
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
If you notice in at town hall meeting

136
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,799
The mayor and everybody around that Council

137
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,383
They all know about Georgetown didn't know about the money

138
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
The Mulino

139
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,759
The Town Council could easily writable a resolution or proposal

140
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,111
And submit it because most of those people that were sitting on their are descendants

141
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:22,463
At this point geologists have identified more than 4000 descendants

142
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,023
Some of them still live in manguin some have left

143
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
Many have never met

144
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
Debra told me that she has fam

145
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
Who disagree with her

146
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
They think she's letting Georgetown off the hook

147
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
So I asked her who

148
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,311
And she said I have a cousin out Nash

149
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
And she gave me a phone number

150
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Hi there can you hear me

151
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
Yes we can hear you

152
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
That is Kathleen Payne will

153
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
Deborah's first cousin

154
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,063
She was expecting my call but

155
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,367
She asked me if I would talk to her mom first

156
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
Her mom grew up in Marin

157
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
So I said sure

158
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,255
Miss Teresa would you just say your name for me please

159
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
My name is

160
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
Teresa a

161
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
Poo

162
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Pain

163
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,239
Theresa a pool pain is 84 years old

164
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,567
Imbiss Teresa can you tell me a little bit about

165
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,151
What life was like in Maryland when you were little girl

166
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
S60 $4,000 chords

167
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,135
Who influenced Chris Young

168
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,951
Get in Marin going

169
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
All I can remember is

170
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,559
We were

171
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,167
I pick cotton when I was a young girl

172
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
I cut

173
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,287
Sugarcane for a few dollars

174
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,591
Because that's all they paid us

175
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
My parents were poor

176
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
Yeah very poor

177
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
My dad

178
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783
Never went to school

179
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,623
I asked her about Georgetown and the first she says

180
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
They don't owe me anything

181
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
Because I got out of Marin

182
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,511
That was not going to stay there

183
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
I don't care if the Kennedys

184
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
Wouldn't live there

185
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
But then again

186
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
She starts thinking back to those cotton

187
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
I can tell you one thing

188
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
Even now

189
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
I look at my legs

190
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
I have

191
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Scratches

192
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
And now

193
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
Wart on my leg

194
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
I could get my daughter

195
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,111
Look at my legs right now

196
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
Until you

197
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183
What kind of marks

198
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,231
I had on my leg

199
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
And I know

200
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,815
That was from working in the field

201
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,143
So careful what you look at my legs

202
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
Is that alright

203
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,615
Maurice's the panther

204
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,943
Didn't know you were doing this so you have on some

205
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
Haider pants

206
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
But

207
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Yeah

208
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
Can you see those marks

209
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,879
Yassi

210
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
And then she says

211
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
Maybe they do owe me

212
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Naomi

213
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
What they didn't pay me

214
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
And what they didn't pay my parents

215
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
Am I Daddy

216
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
Should not have had to work

217
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,775
Inside is he did

218
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,311
To send his

219
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
Children

220
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871
Coco you know

221
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,223
And after that Theresa got tired and her daughter Kathleen got on the phone

222
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,807
Kathleen move back to Nashville recently to look after her mom

223
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
But before that she was a life insurance

224
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
She work for New York Life

225
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Which

226
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:38,815
I don't know maybe that's why Kathleen is not that shy about talking about money

227
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
My mother

228
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
Pick cotton

229
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Okay

230
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
How much is your mother

231
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
For my mother

232
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
I was saying

233
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
Give her a million dollars

234
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
$1000000

235
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
Give her a million dollar

236
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Why a million by a million

237
00:09:54,431 --> 00:10:00,063
You know it's just the easy number to deal with the million dollars by the time any type of taxes

238
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:06,207
If anything like that comes out it'll probably be 500,000 okay to be fair to Kathleen

239
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,255
She is pulling numbers out of thin air

240
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,095
It's not everyday that a strange woman calls your home asks you questions

241
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,167
Then demands that you do the math on what you're owed for slavery

242
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,495
Kathleen actually did this kind of math for a living

243
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,079
But it's different when you're talking about your own family

244
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
She has a daughter Anaya

245
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Musicology

246
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,943
I would say

247
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,783
I would say for Nia

248
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
You could maybe bet on

249
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
1011

250
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
Million-dollar

251
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
You could maybe bet on that

252
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,071
Where'd you get that number from y 10 or 11 million us a lot of money

253
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:49,471
I know it's it's a lot of money and you know I'm our ancestors kept Georgetown for being bankrupt

254
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,055
Georgetown with cease to have existed

255
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,127
If it weren't for those 272 people

256
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,455
Is it you could come to think of it as

257
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
Generational interest

258
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
Think of it that way

259
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
Generational entry

260
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,927
Actually people who do the math on this

261
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
See it in very similar terms

262
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:17,375
Well I was working on the story lots of people told me I needed to talk to a guy named Richard America

263
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
Richard America jr.

264
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,055
Richard America Jr is a retired Professor who taught economic development at Georgetown Business School

265
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
But people didn't send me his way because of George

266
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
Richard America is kind of a legend

267
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,295
In 1990 he edited a book called The Wealth of race

268
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,111
People I talked to kept citing this book

269
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,951
It's a collection of essays where a bunch of Economist and thinkers

270
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,767
Look at how to calculate the debts of slavery

271
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
For the whole country

272
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,351
And how to pay that national debt

273
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,959
The interesting thing about Richard is that unlike everyone else I spoke to

274
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
He does not get emotional talking about reparations

275
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,847
It's not an emotional issue for me it's a technical issue

276
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
It's about

277
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:05,247
How we manage the economy a black man in America why isn't it emotional

278
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,551
Can you teach an institution

279
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,719
What's not about that and that's one reason why the discussion has been kind of off in my opinion for the last three

280
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
50 years what do you mean

281
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
It's not

282
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
It's an accounting problem

283
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
It's a technocratic problem

284
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
It's

285
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
It's not about

286
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
Feelings

287
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
One way or the other

288
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,383
It's it's show me the money that's

289
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
That's all

290
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,687
I read Richard's book

291
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
Or at least I skimmed it

292
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
It's a very technical work

293
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
It's an economic text

294
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,855
It's full of charts and graphs and equations

295
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
It's about data not emotions

296
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,255
Richard didn't especially want to talk about the gu272

297
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,327
He said their descendants are a relatively small group

298
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
And this is a national issue

299
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
Affecting millions of people

300
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
This

301
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
Was part of a system

302
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,543
This is not some isolated incident

303
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,895
This is about 400 years and this is not just about slavery this is about

304
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
The gym Pro.

305
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,039
From the end of the Civil War up to 1965 roughly a hundred years

306
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,855
And the. Since that up to this moment

307
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
He's talking about a moment that includes

308
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,791
Wage discrimination housing discrimination vast differences in school funding

309
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
This is not 1838

310
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
This is 2017

311
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
But I was still really interested in 1838 any of those 272 people and in their descent

312
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
So I went to someone else

313
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,735
Did Thomas Kramer a professor in the department of public policy at the University of Connecticut

314
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
Thomas who spent some years trying

315
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,343
Calculate reparations for slavery

316
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
He's lived in the US for 17 years

317
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,279
But he's from a place that had to deal with its own great evil and paid its own reparation

318
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:59,935
Based on my German Heritage and our own experience with with reparations

319
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,031
I just got naturally interested in the topic

320
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:10,431
A few years after the end of World War II the German government paid around $820

321
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
In reparations to Israel

322
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,063
And at the time some of the fiercest opposition to those reparations

323
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
Came from inside is real

324
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
And from juice

325
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:25,535
They felt it was cheapening the memory of their of their loved ones

326
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,095
I saw a similar Dynamic among many of the

327
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,423
People in rural Louisiana who I spoke to where they said to me

328
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,007
You can't put a price on my ancestors life

329
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
And so I don't want anyting

330
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,151
He says if you are going to put a number on this stuff

331
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
You have to acknowledge that numbers are cold

332
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,783
They are not human they cannot replace a life

333
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
Or dignity

334
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
They don't make up for supper

335
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,671
So in this case he thinks of numbers not as lives

336
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
But as labor

337
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
Slavery was legal

338
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
That was stolen from

339
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
So he showed me quickly

340
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
How he do the math

341
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,935
And it is uncomfortable and it feels inhumane

342
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
And here is how you do it

343
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:11,871
The average age of the Georgetown slaves when they were sold in 1838 was 24

344
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Thomas got that from the bill of sale

345
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,247
That means they were on average born in 1814

346
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
You assume they worked twenty-four hours a day that is the definition of enslavement you don't pick your hours according to my

347
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,487
My records here in 1814 the hourly

348
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,047
Average wage was $0.05

349
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,607
So he multiplies $0.05

350
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
X 24 hours a day

351
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
X 365 days a year

352
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,335
For that year 1814 I get $121,304.28

353
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,919
Biscuitville 272 people would have learned about

354
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,503
$120,000 that year it even paid for their

355
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
Okay

356
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
Where do we go from there

357
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
And then I

358
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:59,231
Repeat this for 18 15 18 16 18 17 18 19 and so on until

359
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,583
38 38 when these men women and children were sold

360
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,911
And each time I'm compounding

361
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:12,543
What was not paid so that's always the previous year years amount

362
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:18,687
A+ the current Year's amount and by 1838 I I'm at

363
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
Let me read this

364
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,807
3000923

365
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,391
$1,383 + 72

366
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:33,023
3923380 $3.72

367
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
That is the amount of

368
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:39,935
Labor that is the amount of money this group of 272 would have learned

369
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:45,567
Between 1814 when on average they were born and 1838 when they were so

370
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
4 million dollars

371
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
In 1838 dollars that these people weren't pay

372
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,295
Let's just for the years that they worked for the Maryland Jesuits and for George

373
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,951
And Thomas has baked in a 1.8% interest rate to reflect the rate of inflation over the country test

374
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:08,607
And then from there I'm basically just compounding it up at the same interest rate all the way to two

375
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
2017

376
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,983
For this entire group of 2in

377
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:19,871
We're sitting there and Thomas is fiddling around with boxes on his Excel spreadsheet and it's an awful feeling

378
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:26,783
But we set out to find a number and he has come up with a number

379
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
89 million

380
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
30

381
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,391
4000

382
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
$13

383
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
+ 47

384
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,071
Okay 99034000 $13.40

385
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,655
Is the amount that these 272 people

386
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,447
Would have earned

387
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
If they had been paid for their

388
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,823
Right if it was paid today

389
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,127
Does 99 million dollars

390
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,711
99 million dollars just about does that strike you as Fair

391
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,015
Well let's let's

392
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,367
Calculated to the individual descendant nondividing that amount by

393
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,439
3800 individuals that have so far being

394
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,511
Identified and I arrive at

395
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:13,119
$26,061.58

396
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Descendants

397
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:18,495
But then he changes the interest rate just slightly to 3%

398
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
Let's see

399
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,055
Now I get

400
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
And

401
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,407
Estimated dead in 2017

402
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
That is

403
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:33,087
914051344.

404
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
Hours and 49 cents

405
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,695
900 did we go from

406
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Yes wow

407
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:45,375
Winchester from 99 million to 940 million

408
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
Is all theoretical math

409
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
And you could say

410
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,007
And some of you will then it's wrong to do this kind of math

411
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,591
Be doing this kind of cold calculation on people's lives

412
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
Was what got us in trouble in the first

413
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,967
But Thomas has consider what these numbers mean

414
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,527
That's a billion dollars in today's money

415
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,087
Not paid to these 272 pill

416
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,927
A billion dollars not passed down through their families over time

417
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
A billion dollars of inheritance

418
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
It was never inherited

419
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
They couldn't go to pay for homes

420
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
Or for school fees or for doctors

421
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,215
If you were to take that billion and divided Among The Descendants

422
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,031
You be about $250,000 at

423
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
But

424
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,383
More descendants are being identified all the time

425
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:35,039
As a country we've been talking about reparations for slavery since the end of slavery

426
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:40,671
Carlton Waterhouse is a professor at Indiana University law school he is also a lawyer

427
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:46,815
He's working with a team of six other lawyers to represent some of the descendants of the 272

428
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
They're working pro bono

429
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
And he specializes in reparation

430
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,055
My work on reparations relates mostly to scholarship I wrote my dissertation about it for my PhD degree

431
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,127
And then I've also written a number of articles about it as well

432
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,943
He says his clients aren't making money a priority

433
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,271
They're interested in things like memorials to their ancestor

434
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,319
And Museum exhibits in their honor

435
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,183
As a legal case reparations for slavery are really hard

436
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,487
If you want to sue you have to have stand

437
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,279
You have to prove you've been harm

438
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,863
And the people were talking about have been dead for a very long time

439
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,727
Carlton told me a story about how we dealt with reparations in the past

440
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
I mean

441
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,823
This is going to sound a little strange but you have to have to go with

442
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
After slavery end

443
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,967
After slavery ended there were plenty of people alive who been enslaved

444
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,295
In the 1890s there was a woman in Nashville

445
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,111
A very determined freed slave name

446
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Cali house

447
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,183
Okay so Cali house

448
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,743
Begins to organize for slave pension

449
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,815
Which is basically to provide a pension

450
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,375
For all the people who were enslaved

451
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
And worked

452
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
And now

453
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
You know I live in LA

454
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
People sleep

455
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
People still alive after slavery

456
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
Yeah yeah yeah this is right after slavery

457
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,127
Kelly hausbarn storms across the South

458
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,431
Visiting black churches and lodges

459
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
Drumming up support

460
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:13,087
Keep on singing national ex-slave Mutual relief Bounty and pension Association

461
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
And within a couple of years

462
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,928
She has hundreds of thousands of members

463
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,768
And Kelly has his movement had some unexpected supporters

464
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,632
The idea of slave pension scheme from a white legislator in Nebraska

465
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,216
Because the South's economy was in Ruins no one had any money

466
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:34,080
And he figured you give freed slaves pensions you help the whole southern economy

467
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,944
Kelly stayed in touch with her members through mail through the US Postal Service

468
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
And the way this all ended

469
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Not

470
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Inventions

471
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
She was arrest

472
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,416
For engaging in mail fraud

473
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:53,280
For suggesting that they could in anyway pot that could anyway it ever possibly

474
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,352
How did they get her on mail fraud

475
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,936
Because she sent out a basically a flyer

476
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:04,544
Two people saying come with us campaign to help you know

477
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
Get this

478
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
Slave pension fund

479
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:12,736
Here's what happened her Association charged a small dues fee to support their push for pension

480
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,528
The Postal Service said

481
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
Those pensions are never going to happen

482
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,160
And by promising people they will and collecting dues

483
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
You're defrauding

484
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,232
She spent a year in prison

485
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,048
It is as though as a country

486
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,352
We've always treated reparations

487
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
Like a fairy

488
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
But it dangerous

489
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,960
Some descendants told me

490
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,008
They don't even like to use the word

491
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,824
I had more than one conversation where someone started

492
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
But then stopped

493
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,688
But that doesn't mean they're not thinking about

494
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
Hi I'm Joe Stewart

495
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,784
I live in the Battle Cry

496
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
Creek Michigan

497
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
How old are you

498
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
I'm 74

499
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
And where are you from

500
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,720
I'm from maringouin Louisiana

501
00:22:54,976 --> 00:23:01,120
You might remember Joe from our last episode he's the gentleman who got up and Stood Beside georgetown's president at this big

502
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
Informal meeting

503
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,704
And told him the descendants don't feel listened to

504
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,264
You got to hear from us

505
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,824
If reconciliation is going to take

506
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
Play says it

507
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
And it has

508
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,408
It needs to start

509
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
At home and you don't

510
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,224
Start reconciling bael

511
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
Jill has gotten idea

512
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,088
Did nothing to do with individual payouts

513
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,208
A foundation of foundation that has the potential

514
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,328
Just been stained for generations to come in look like

515
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,168
The foundation would be based on a truck

516
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,472
The billion dollars

517
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,264
Initial trust fund

518
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,568
What wait hold on hold on

519
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
A billion dollars

520
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,128
A billion dollars

521
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,688
About that billion dollars

522
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
You might hear that and think as I did

523
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
What

524
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,344
Well Joe Stewart from Maryland Louisiana

525
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
Knows of which he speaks

526
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,488
For 14 years he was a trustee of the nine billion dollar Kellogg Foundation

527
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:05,120
During his tenure that Foundation doled out hundreds of millions of dollars in Grants every year

528
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,680
Jose met with just about every president dating back

529
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
Carter through Kellogg

530
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
He was in South Africa in the 80s

531
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,056
Helping to negotiate the end of Apartheid

532
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,152
And probably because of all that experienced many of The Descendants

533
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
Have signed on with Joe

534
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,248
They're pushing for that billion dollars of seed money

535
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,064
Enough money to sustain educational initiative

536
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,112
Send business initiatives for The Descendants

537
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,672
So where will the money come from

538
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
Joseph

539
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
At least 700 million of it

540
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
Will come from George

541
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
But

542
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Not

543
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
Just George

544
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,424
Because Joe pointed out something that I think a lot of people

545
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Keep forgetting

546
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:45,056
Those 272 people were sold to save Georgetown from dead yes

547
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
But they were owned

548
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
By the Jesuits

549
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,920
An order within the Catholic Church

550
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,456
Angela mentioned

551
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,016
The Catholic Church makes Georgetown look

552
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
Puny

553
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
I've been cap

554
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
All my life I think

555
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
One of the richest

556
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,696
Religions are institutions on the face of the Earth

557
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Ha

558
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,072
You know my question is simple

559
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,680
Do you understand the damage that was done in 1838

560
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,472
When you considered

561
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
People

562
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Chattel

563
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,080
And so Joe plans to negotiate

564
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
Not just with Georgetown but with the Jesuit

565
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
This isn't going to die

566
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
And go away

567
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
And I say

568
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
Georgetown

569
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,040
I think the Judge

570
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,832
And I think the Catholic Church

571
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
Understand

572
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
That this is

573
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
It's not going away

574
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,976
And they eventually going to have to

575
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
How to deal with it

576
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,328
I asked the Maryland Jesuits and they said yes

577
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,144
They are talking to Joe and representatives of

578
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
His group

579
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,960
They wouldn't say much more except that

580
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
It's early

581
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,592
At the end of all this I called Deborah Tilson in Louisiana back

582
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
I'd spent so much time with her

583
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,688
And I wanted to ask her how we gone

584
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,760
From a little adult Literacy Center in Marin Gwynn

585
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,552
To a billion-dollar ask

586
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,880
I wanted to know why talking about money makes her

587
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,904
So ambivalent

588
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
But it doesn't for others

589
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
Who live so far away

590
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
And ever said to me

591
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
I want you to think about what happened

592
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
If Georgetown

593
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,656
Here I am

594
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
I'm getting along

595
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:21,056
With some of the same people that own on my family and stuff

596
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,336
With some people that owns your face

597
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,408
Yeah and then now you know Georgetown

598
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,200
Is giving me this

599
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,784
Check you know cuz they want to make amends and all of that

600
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
But then

601
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
What about

602
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
The ones who

603
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Purchase me

604
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
You know

605
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
I would be

606
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,024
Sitting there like saying what okay I'll let Georgetown office

607
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,096
Uniform it would be like without but

608
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
What about

609
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,680
You know they had your family

610
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,752
And they will beat them and doing everything

611
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
So

612
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,872
Now do I go over and I asked him to hey look Georgetown page

613
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:59,456
But what about you owning me

614
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,040
And these wouldn't be people far away in Washington DC

615
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
She says

616
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,160
American black people and white people live with their past everyday

617
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,744
They shop together they eat together to go to church together

618
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
Deborah says

619
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,560
It's fine not

620
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
Saying something

621
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,632
By not asking for something

622
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,448
If they can continue to live side-by-side

623
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,288
And it is also by not saying something

624
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
That we allow this massive debt

625
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,872
To keep accruing exponential

626
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,968
After 3 days in Marin

627
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
I'm really had trouble leaving

628
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
All I need you to do

629
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,368
Just get on the highway and go back East toward Baton Rouge

630
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,184
We're going around in a town like Marin

631
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
You can really see

632
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,024
How history stretches into the present

633
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,632
And there was a thing that I'd heard from people who study reparations for slavery

634
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,192
They say the hard part about all of this

635
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,752
Isn't that history is so far away

636
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,080
The hard part is that history is just so

637
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:04,480

If you think you might be a descendant get in touch with them there at Georgetown memory project.org and ignore

653
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:21,792
Warmest thanks to all of The Descendants both in and outside of Maryland who spent time with me for these two episodes

654
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,632
