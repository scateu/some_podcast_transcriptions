1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,328
Just a quick warning there is some bad language

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,352
Which in Today Show

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,400
A couple years ago

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,472
Alice Wu was an undergraduate at UC

5
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,240
The Berkeley

6
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,264
Studying economics

7
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,824
Monday at some of her friends told her hey

8
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,872
You should check out this thing we just found

9
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,432
It's called the economics job market rumors

10
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,480
Then you like I wanted to

11
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,016
To do a PhD in comics

12
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,832
I thought you told me they were half joking like

13
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:28,416
Future call eggs and stuff dolls with lecture fine

14
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,696
What's the website

15
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,232
Click through a few threads

16
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:35,328
I was just surprised or like really in shock when I saw those

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
Commons

18
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
Just kind of

19
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,960
Pointed directly to a very hostile environment

20
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:44,032
This forum had originally started as a place

21
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:48,128
Or PhD students to swap information about the job market

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
Who got an interview who got fired

23
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,736
People started using it to like

24
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
Argue about nerdy econ research things you know like coase's theorem is highly overrated

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,744
It's an anonymous online forum

26
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,816
Meaning but soon it became pretty much the worst

27
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,376
At least parts of it did

28
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
End

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Alice

30
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,728
Stumbled into some of that stuff locker room talk

31
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,264
Of something

32
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,568
Or like a boys club

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
I like that

34
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,640
Took out very

35
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,920
Disgusting

36
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,200
Very quickly

37
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
No

38
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,248
Numbers-wise

39
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,552
Economics is a boys club

40
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
There's this

41
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,368
Stark gender gap in the profession

42
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:36,512
For example in the US in 2018 just 17% of full professors economics for women

43
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,608
At the undergrad level only about a third of all econ Majors for women

44
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,680
Even though more than half of undergraduates overall wear women

45
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,984
So far all is all of that is

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
Kind of just part of

47
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,592
And this nasty stuff she's reading on the Forum

48
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
Children really dwell on it

49
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
She gets out of the Forum pretty fast

50
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,760
Sounds like maybe this is one of the dark secret professions I didn't really think so

51
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
Too much about it

52
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Until

53
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,320
A couple months later

54
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,904
She was in a meeting with her advisor else was in my office.

55
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
Chat a little bit about ideas for

56
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
Senior Theses this is David

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
Card he's a big-shot labor economist

58
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,120
First met Alice when she was a student in his advanced economies

59
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,704
So they're sitting there in his office Battleground ideas for her

60
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
FS1

61
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
The phone rang

62
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,520
David picked up

63
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,104
It was an old friend of mine whose it was actually the chairman at the

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
Princeton economics Department

65
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
Jack Curry

66
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
And

67
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
Janet was quite upset

68
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
Italian upset because

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
She had been reading that same forum

70
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
She was familiar with the place

71
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
And she was fed up with it

72
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Because

73
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:44,096
There seems to be a very persistent pattern of basically there's a lot of negative stuff being said about female economist

74
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:49,984
She hung up the phone after I got off the phone I kind of mentioned this to Allison I said this is what we were just talking about

75
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,104
I've been sitting there a code you know about the akan job market rumors for him

76
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
Isaiah heard about it

77
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,456
I wouldn't have thought you would know about it it turns out I guess

78
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
People know more stuff than you

79
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
You think if they know

80
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
I was told me she thinks

81
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,648
Pretty much everyone in economics has been on this forum at one point or another

82
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,488
So she and David start talking about it just looks like a little

83
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
Pretty terrible situation

84
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
And I

85
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,096
I'm not exactly sure how we got to

86
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:21,216
To this point I think you say maybe could just write a small report really a 10-page report

87
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,032
What's going with the forearm is like

88
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,872
See just exactly what was the pattern was there any really

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,712
Difference in how people were talking about female versus male economist

90
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,272
This is the place where I think economist

91
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
Diverge from normal people

92
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
The most people here is How The Story Goes

93
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,952
Yule log on to an anonymous online forum

94
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
See a bunch of sexist garbage and say

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
It looks like people on this former being sexist

96
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Case closed

97
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
But

98
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
A lot of economist

99
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
Don't see the world this way

100
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,056
They have in the words of one Economist I talk to a bias

101
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
Against bias

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,480
This deep-seated belief that often things that look a lot like discrimination

103
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
Can be explained in other ways

104
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
So what else will you set out to do

105
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,136
What do you use the tools of economic

106
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,208
How to test for bias on econjobrumors.

107
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Because

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
As an economist

109
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
She couldn't be sure it was there until she wrote a rigorous replicable statistically sound quantitative economics

110
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,983
Teen debit card

111
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
Their data people it would be

112
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
Probably important

113
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
Just to establish the facts

114
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431
It did turn out to be important

115
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,783
Alice Wu ended up writing her undergraduate senior thesis about this for him

116
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
And the paper

117
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,927
Which proved something so obvious that Alice herself almost blew it off

118
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,279
That paper became one of the most talked-about economic papers of the year

119
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
The New York Times wrote about it

120
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,423
One Economist called Alice the most important Economist for 2017

121
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,751
And some of the most famous people in the profession

122
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,311
Women who have been a condiments for decades

123
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,199
Say Alex is work is helping them to finally talk about big problems in economic

124
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
Hello and welcome to Planet Money

125
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
I'm finally home

126
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
Today on the show

127
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
A young economist

128
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,159
Holds a mirror up to the field

129
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
And her colleagues don't like what they see

Look up a child swim in a minute

143
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
But first

144
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,839
This idea in economics that sings

145
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,167
That look like discrimination might not actually be discrimination

146
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
Where does that come from

147
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,031
Can you hear me can you hear me

148
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,847
Yes I called up Beatrice Cherry a

149
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
She's a historian of economics

150
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
And

151
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,711
She told me that there was this one

152
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,783
Theory of discrimination that emerged in the 1950s

153
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,903
In later decades it became a dominant Theory and a lot of people are still into

154
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
It was applied to racial discrimination and

155
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,303
An Economist who believed this model

156
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,351
Think about discrimination in the labor market

157
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
Basically this way

158
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
In a perfectly competitive world

159
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
Discrimination is

160
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
Terrible form

161
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,103
You're a sexist manager you just don't like women

162
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Some Economist would call this

163
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
MSU of animist

164
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
So you'll hire a less

165
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,807
Competent man rather than a more competent women

166
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Gun

167
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
You'll fall behind your competitors

168
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,231
If your business you'll make less money has Department your reputation will suffer

169
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
Discrimination is an efficient

170
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
So because it's inefficient

171
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,911
A market dynamics are going to push these people who have a taste

172
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,727
Spoken for discrimination out of the market

173
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,543
So basically it's going to get competition to weigh

174
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:13,151
Yeah exactly so you don't need to do anything about discrimination

175
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
Because it's going to disappear

176
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,783
And it's say gender disparities don't disappear

177
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
Maybe that's okay

178
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623
Maybe women don't want to enter the war

179
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,671
Women stay at home

180
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
Because it's irrational calculus its

181
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
Specialization within the house

182
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
So

183
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,887
Horizon from their preference

184
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
Did you know it's their choice

185
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
Back in the 1970s

186
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
A group of female economist

187
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
Sad

188
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
Our preference is to be economist

189
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,687
Reason for not getting the opportunities we should

190
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,783
Econ departments should actively encourage women grad students

191
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087
Whether or not they're married or half

192
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
Some Economist didn't want to do that

193
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,279
Beatriz told me there are letters from this time we're Milton Friedman

194
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,839
One of the most famous economist in America

195
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
Was arguing against it

196
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,191
Is explicitly applying is

197
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,519
Thinking about the labor market how the labor market work

198
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
To the problem women in the comic

199
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,871
But around the same time the 1970

200
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,455
Economist are developing a new theory of discrimination

201
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,527
And this new theory is sort of about

202
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
Pizza connoisseur like

203
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
Maybe it's not

204
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Animus

205
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
Maybe discrimination happens

206
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,255
Because employers are making bad assumptions

207
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
Based on imperfect information

208
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
So they look at the world

209
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,215
See that men are publishing more economics papers than women say

210
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:46,335
And then when they're hiring an economics professor they look at their job candidates and they're like

211
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,687
I guess I should hire a man because on average men published more

212
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
It's called

213
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
Statistical discrimination

214
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
Discrimination based

215
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
Not on cannabis

216
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
But on statistic

217
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,023
Economist can spend hours on the philosophy of how those two things are different I personally don't get it but I'm almost ready to retire

218
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:11,423
Everybody's talked about that forever so this is David card again the big shot labor Economist who was Alice Woo's advisor

219
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
You told me that

220
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,239
Both these models have a lot of cloud

221
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
And he has an affair

222
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
One reason economist

223
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
Care about the difference

224
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,199
Is because it might affect what you do about discrimination

225
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,039
Like in this statistical discrimination model

226
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,367
Maybe you can solve the problem by giving employers

227
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
More information

228
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
About how women are actually great

229
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,791
And if they don't have animus in their hearts

230
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,631
That information might convince them not to discriminate

231
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,935
Maybe we can do something about this

232
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
And yet

233
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
I was just

234
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,335
Surprise or like really in shock when I saw those

235
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Commons

236
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,687
There are also places like econjobrumors. Com

237
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
In fact

238
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,271
Anyone who's ever been on the internet might think

239
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Anime

240
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
Seems to be out there

241
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Now

242
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,671
David card is part of a big group of Labor economist

243
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,463
Who say basically

244
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,791
We don't need to keep endlessly arguing about why

245
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
Discrimination is happen

246
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
Go out into the world and get data

247
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
Documents

248
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
Annapolis student Alice Wu

249
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
Set out to try

250
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
Remember she wanted to know if there was a difference

251
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:27,199
It's in the way men and women were being talked about on this forum a difference she could prove

252
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:33,599
Her first step was basically to write a computer program that would download the post

253
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,623
From The Forum

254
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,207
2217000

255
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
And 46 of them

256
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,607
So after scraping data is kind of just in very messy form so he's all like

257
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
Post after post

258
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,751
Now she has to figure out how to sort these posts into buck

259
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,823
1 bucket is post about men

260
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
1 bucket is post about women

261
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,503
And to sort of her first step is to pick out words that clearly refer to them

262
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,831
Most rare follower wise are pronouns like she or he

263
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Her

264
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,647
That was so other general ones

265
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,183
Like female now women

266
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:14,047
Man I think I remember from your paper there was also bro and bruit

267
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Is that right

268
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Yes

269
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,935
Chelsea picked out names classified as those as male or female

270
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,495
And once you have this initial list of words

271
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Some of the posts

272
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
Are super easy to classify

273
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,919
Like if a bird he appears 20 times in a post in the word she doesn't appear at all

274
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,711
It's probably a post talking about men

275
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
Echoes in the mailbox

276
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Agitate

277
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Those pills

278
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,391
The ones that are obviously talking about men or obviously talking about women

279
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
And she analyzes.

280
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
Using machine learning

281
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
12

282
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
And that's a list of

283
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Other word

284
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
Words that come up

285
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
Disproportionately in post

286
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
About women or post

287
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
About men

288
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
Alice brother that list

289
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
My first impression was obviously the

290
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,335
Bad but if you

291
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,407
Are familiar with a forearm and look at those poses with him

292
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Surprising

293
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,247
She went to an advising meeting with David card and

294
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,087
At some point she offhandedly showed him the list

295
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,183
I just showed him like oh hey this is a list of words and he was like

296
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,231
Can you show it to me

297
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,303
Do you have card immediately knew that this list

298
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
It wasn't just

299
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,423
Like preliminary data it was a finding in itself

300
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
Because

301
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
When Alice showed him this list

302
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,079
He didn't even want to read the words out loud while Alice

303
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
Student was sitting there in his office

304
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
You could imagine

305
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,247
A situation where a male older male Professor physics

306
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
Showing a list

307
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
Of words like that

308
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Two younger female

309
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Student and

310
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
I could lose my job

311
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
I wasn't that worried about it but

312
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,303
I was aware that you know

313
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
We're not going to say those words out loud

314
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
In my office

315
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
I pulled up the latest version of Elsa

316
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
The paper while we were talking

317
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,239
Can we look at the words

318
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
Oh yeah

319
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
Wow okay

320
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,151
Would you mind reading them to me

321
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,527
You don't have to if you don't want to that's okay but

322
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Will you

323
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
Actually wood and Watson

324
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,207
So I read some of them pretty terrible let me see

325
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
Blonde

326
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Unattractive

327
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
Gorgeous

328
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
Assaulted

329
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
There's also naked

330
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Horror

331
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
Wow

332
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
Raped

333
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Vagina

334
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Ugly

335
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,871
I'm less offensive but still not great ones like pregnant and Mary

336
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,735
To be fair there are some disturbing words on the mail list

337
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
2

338
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,087
The top word most disproportionately associated with post about men is

339
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Homo

340
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
The second is testosterone

341
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,743
Along the way there were also some words that were just confusing

342
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
Why is salmon one of the most malware

343
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
I don't ever talk about food

344
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
Why is mountains on there

345
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:04,031
I have no idea how Tallis the main distinction has to do with which of the words are professional

346
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
And which words are

347
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
Personal

348
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,455
Notably none of the words that were disproportionately associated with women have to

349
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
To do with economics

350
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,599
But words disproportionately associated with men included things like

351
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
Macroeconomics

352
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Keynesian

353
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
Advisor

354
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
Nobel

355
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,071
This west end up becoming a big part of Alice's senior piece

356
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,935
And it's the part that people in the economics profession have really

357
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
Grabbed onto

358
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,823
No I should say that this study is narrow it has limitations

359
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,895
For one thing the posters are anonymous

360
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
So we don't know who is saying all this nasty

361
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,271
Stop or how many people are saying it

362
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,927
Remember this is about how it disproportionately these words come up in post about men and post about women

363
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,231
Not how frequently they come up

364
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
So

365
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,351
For example out of 400,000 post that Alice analyzed

366
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
The word ugly comes up

367
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,471
1046 X in posts about women

368
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,775
And 404 times in post

369
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Batman

370
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
Did card has study discrimination

371
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
4 years

372
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
He says

373
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
One reason why Alice is paper is important is

374
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
Because it identified

375
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Animus

376
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Animus

377
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
So not

378
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,647
People just need a little more information and then they'll do the right thing

379
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Dammit

380
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
Hostility

381
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Meanest

382
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
This

383
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:31,583
Demonstration on econjobrumors says it is really something to adamhs

384
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,887
It's not that everybody has a pure mind

385
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
That is just

386
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,727
I really wish I could hire women but you know there's

387
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Is not that good

388
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,079
This is like oh my God these guys are going out of their way to trash

389
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
Of course

390
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:48,479
Alice's paper does not prove that their hiring discrimination happening in economic

391
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,087
These posters could just be a tiny slice of Trolli PhD Bros who

392
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
Don't have any real cloud

393
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
End

394
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
It might have become just

395
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,023
A really good senior thesis that helped Alice Wu get into grad school

396
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
But that's not what happened

397
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
After the break

398
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
Alice's paper blows up

399
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
This message comes from NPR spawn

Na

411
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
So Alice

412
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
Finish your senior year of college

413
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:30,719
Second semester her thesis is done to sign into Harvard for grad school she can relax a little

414
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Ashley

415
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,863
Discover my interest in beer

416
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,399
He says when the prize

417
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,215
And over the summer she gets an email

418
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:46,079
Economist Justin wolfers wants to write about her paper in the New York Times

419
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
Ultimately says okay

420
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
You know

421
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
She's nervous

422
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
It was real

423
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,783
Like a lot of pressure

424
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
First

425
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111
Economics paper at Rio like

426
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
I don't know

427
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
But she agreed to do it

428
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,047
When the New York Times piece came out the reaction was

429
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Huge

430
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
Economist spoke out

431
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,679
Online at conferences is an email to Alice

432
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,519
They were sharing personal experiences with sexism in the field

433
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,335
It will start talking about those you no more

434
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:24,479
I'm so I think that the form is definitely problematic but it reflects something much

435
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,319
Larger than the Forum itself is just basically reflect

436
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623
The gender issues in

437
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:36,767
The profession one place where Alice's paper was big news was at this annual meeting of economist

438
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,839
The meeting of the American economic Association

439
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,655
Fate is a big deal

440
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,263
One thing this conference is where grad students interview for faculty jobs

441
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,079
It's where fancy new papers got presented

442
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,663
Alice spoke on a panel at the AAA conference in 2018

443
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,223
And around that time

444
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,783
She did something that made her a little anxious

445
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
She searched

446
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
Her own name

447
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Anaphora

448
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:07,743
One thing you like I'll be presenting at this session there were just some really

449
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,303
Like we are common they're like oh we are going

450
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
Stalkers

451
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
Something that was really scary

452
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,191
It didn't turn out to be that way at all

453
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:21,055
Alice presented her paper alongside several other female Economist who studied women in the field

454
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:27,455
Are entangled Betsy Stephenson and Tatiana a Bulova when the New York Times word about this panel their head line began

455
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
Wielding data

456
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,295
Women force a reckoning over bias

457
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
And it seems like data

458
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,159
Has really convinced a lot of economist

459
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
Did they have a problem

460
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:44,095
Play I actually did a big survey this past year to get more and more comprehensive data about the culture in Act

461
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Comics

462
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,215
Not about sexism they also asked about racism and about sexual harassment

463
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
And

464
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,847
The survey showed that racism and sexism and harassment are problem in the field

465
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Predictably

466
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,431
It also showed that not all economist

467
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
See the problem in the same way

468
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:04,831
For example 52% of men who took the survey agreed that women are respected in the field

469
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,391
Only 16% of women agree

470
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:12,255
I wanted to talk to someone from The Forum who would read Allison paper and

471
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
See if it change their mind

472
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
So

473
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,887
I made an account on econjobrumors. Com

474
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
I searched Alice Wu

475
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,239
And I posted on one of the preds about the paper

476
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
Hey

477
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,871
I'm a reporter I told people to get in touch if they're willing to talk

478
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
When I hit this button

479
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,943
Suncoast

480
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,015
I didn't specify my gender by the way because I was nervous

481
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
Oh my God

482
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
We'll see what happens

483
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,487
Pretty soon I got the first response

484
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
It starts

485
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,047
Ball yeah right

486
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
The person didn't believe I was a real journalist

487
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
They went on to say

488
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Let's face it

489
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
Lysol better than the truth

490
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,775
And even if by some miracle this person

491
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
Academy

492
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Was concerned about the truth

493
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
We all know that this person Lacks

494
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,711
The technical knowledge to understand any of our explanations

495
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
Why the paper is wrong

496
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,831
There were a few other responses to some of the nicer but

497
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,903
Basically I was a paper didn't convince everyone

498
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,511
I crawled this idea that competition should help get rid of animus

499
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
Discrimination so

500
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
May we don't have to worry about it

501
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,143
What idea has been around a long time

502
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
Life of economist

503
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
Still believe it

504
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,287
At the big annual meeting of the AA this past year

505
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,079
People were confronting this head-on

506
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,407
Okay welcome everyone thank you for coming

507
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Coming out

508
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,271
This is Betsy Stephenson an economist at the University of Michigan

509
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,087
She sitting on stage with a bunch of famous economist

510
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
All women

511
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Economist

512
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,975
Swear to come to the field with a prior that there's no

513
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,559
Discrimination and they're only going to move their prior

514
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,351
When confronted with some sort of

515
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Compelling evidence

516
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
My question to the panel is

517
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
How can we best

518
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,823
Address those who are the most skeptical that there's any kind of problem with discrimination

519
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,151
One of the economist on stage is Susan Athey

520
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
Stanford professor

521
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,479
People have this habit of making me statements

522
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
To me seems somewhat

523
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
Ridiculous like

524
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:14,367
Oh you know this can't be an issue to get some Peter to etcetera

525
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,928
And you know I don't really want to get in that argue

526
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
I might

527
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
I might get emotional I might lose my

528
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:25,888
My temper I might never think about that person the same way and so it's it's really very risky I feel

529
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
Still

530
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
Start these

531
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Conversation

532
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:34,592
And since I want to make sure that when I answer I'm going to be answering in the economic way

533
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Evidence

534
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,432
Data so thank you everyone who's giving me

535
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
Data

536
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
Uniqlo

537
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
It's very hard to tell so on stage

538
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,040
Janet Yellen

539
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,856
The only woman ever to chair the Federal Reserve

540
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,440
Which is arguably the most powerful Economic Policy job in the world

541
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,000
You know you uas busy

542
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,328
Why it's so difficult to convince man I think they

543
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:00,448
Regard themselves as rational in the field is being highly meritocratic

544
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
And it does

545
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Requires some evidence

546
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
You know what evidence yellin was

547
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,104
Particularly impressed by

548
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,944
I think we got that evidence in the atlas wallpaper I think that was

549
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,016
A remarkably convincing

550
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:19,136
Appalling finding I haven't heard any mansao that's all

551
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,928
Finding it shows our field

552
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
Is functioning

553
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
Well when properly

554
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,072
Janet Yellen will take over as head of the AA next year

555
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
And

556
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,144
The ETA has started making some changes

557
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,728
