1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,072
Not too long ago the Public Zoo

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,376
Up in Calgary Alberta

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,656
Beast a unique Pro

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,472
They have these lovely Asian elephants

5
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,240
Sri Lanka

6
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,288
Animal display for almost 40 years

7
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,568
Swarna is

8
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,616
Kind of the odd one out she's Beyonce

9
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:22,272
And and then there's a biological pair Kamala and Ronnie the mother and daughter

10
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,576
Is a reporter for NPR who first told us about the

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,696
And she said the problem was one that will be familiar to anyone who has traveled

12
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,464
Canada

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488
In the winter

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,024
The weather sucks

15
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,584
Especially if you are from Sri Lanka

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,192
Calgary's up in Alberta so it is chilly most of the year it's

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,776
Snowing it's slushy is gross outside

18
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:46,080
For years the zoo officials in Calgary

19
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,616
Had been making the best

20
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
Of this elephant Scituate

21
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,712
We've made Snowmen for them and

22
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,760
What do they do with the Snowman

23
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
Push it over

24
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,320
And then even

25
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,368
Colin Baird is the elephant curator

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,976
NFL Canadian I can say that it is always tough to accept

27
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,000
The perhaps

28
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,328
Not every creature should live in the true north strong and free

29
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,888
But calling says eventually they had to face reality

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
They had to find a new home

31
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
For the elephants

32
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,080
They needed to go somewhere where they could be outdoors all year round and have a whole herd of elephants

33
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
Around them

34
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,384
You know guys to play with

35
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,200
Now normally when you have something that you don't want anymore

36
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,992
You put up for sale right

37
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,528
He put an ad on Craigslist

38
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,576
Three elephants good condition

39
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,624
No reasonable offer refused

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,648
Check the Move Yourself

41
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,952
But zoo animals are different from most

42
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,976
Possessions because

43
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,536
Zoos have this fundamental Prince

44
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
You cannot

45
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Cell

46
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
Garanimals

47
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,656
You can't buy animals either

48
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,936
It is unethical

49
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,960
Illegal even

50
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,008
To put a price tag on an elephant's head

51
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
I can say my name first and you say

52
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,480
Hello looking to Planet Money on Robert Smith Gabrielle I've been reporting for NPR's National.

Korean show

54
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,368
Why did zoos and Aquariums give up one of the most useful tools a business have

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
Ability to buy and sell their assets

56
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
What do you do

57
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
In a world

58
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280

69
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
Thanks on Earth

70
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:58,944
Because it makes everything so easy money let you know who wants what

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,248
And let you know how badly they want it

72
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,064
Money lets you get rid of things you don't need

73
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,112
And get things that you do need

74
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
And for hundreds of years zoos were like

75
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Any other

76
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,744
They did buy and sell ads

77
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Openly

78
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,584
Larry Brown is a historian at Boston College who studies

79
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,168
Supersprings on a competition to have Prestige animal

80
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Get

81
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
The animals really going to

82
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
To draw

83
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
The publican

84
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,104
The crowds the crowd

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
And they're willing to spend big money

86
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
To get them

87
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
To understand

88
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,528
Why zoos eventually got out of the buying and selling business

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
We're too quick historic

90
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
Local stories

91
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,392
The first one happened about 150 years ago

92
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,488
Brown said back then zoos would basically go to explorers

93
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
And give them a checklist

94
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,328
For when the next went to Africa or Asia

95
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
We want one of those gorillas

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
Maybe I'm up here of those giraffes

97
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
And we are willing to pay

98
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,032
Zoll epitomized is a German man named Carl Hagen bag

99
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,616
He's a businessman who buys and sells wild animal

100
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,176
He really Built This Global Empire

101
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,736
Hagen back could get you anything you want

102
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
Polar bears

103
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,576
Can a pot of my wild Mongolian horses

104
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,648
I prided himself as being this honest

105
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Above board business

106
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
He would price the animals based on size and bite

107
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
Vitality

108
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,815
Even at a money back guarantee

109
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
If your animal

110
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
Sick

111
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
Was not quite the color you wanted

112
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
He would refund the price

113
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,751
If the animal was slightly smaller than he promised

114
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
DD discount

115
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,359
But even back then you could see the problem

116
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,407
With putting a price on an animal's head

117
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,479
The way Carl Hagen that got his animals was

118
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
Pretty horrifying

119
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:43,135
He got a request in from a zoo in your author America and then go out on the expedition

120
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:48,511
And he find the family maybe an elephant family and actually

121
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
Kill the parents

122
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
And then take the Young

123
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
Bring them back to the zoos

124
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,167
Call Hagen back talks about this openly in

125
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
In his memoirs

126
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,239
He recounts bloody scenes in the jungle

127
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
And

128
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
The story

129
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
In addition to going out and collecting wild beast

130
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
He would also

131
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
Bring back human

132
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
Does he bring back

133
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:13,599
Eskimos Samoans people from Sudan and he exhibit them in Europe

134
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,695
He put whole family's on display with a little domestic scene

135
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,487
And he call it anthropology

136
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
Clearly this did not give Zeus

137
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
The best record

138
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
Any news

139
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,679
They slowly tried to distance themselves from poachers

140
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
And they're pretty horrible Tech

141
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
This is not an easy thing to

142
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
Because you can say you are going to buy from the back

143
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,943
But if there's a price any price on an animal's head

144
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
People will

145
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
Hunt those animal people will trap those animal

146
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
That's the incentive

147
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
And you don't always know what happened

148
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
Adam jungle

149
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,927
So getting ready completely out of the zoo business

150
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,207
Took a second

151
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Disturbing event

152
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
This one more recent

153
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
Let me set the scene

154
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
The 1960s

155
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
70

156
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,655
Countries in Asia and Africa have been pushing back

157
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
Alex Ikea

158
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
The guys in pith helmet

159
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Could just

160
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
Walton and Dragway animals

161
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
For some City Zoo

162
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
And then at the same time

163
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
The conservation movement is in full swing

164
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
Thanks Rachel Carson's the Silent Spring where everyone's beginning to reassess how humans and nature

165
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
Wild animals all in Iraq

166
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,391
In 1973 there was as big conf

167
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
88

168
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
Trying to figure out how to stop the Wild and

169
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
Animal trade

170
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
How to implement new conservation rules

171
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,143
And they're having trouble as these conferences do agreeing on anything

172
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
While they were in session

173
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,751
There is this surprise

174
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
News copper

175
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:41,151
One of the assistant Secretary of the Interior Nathaniel Reed stands up and says

176
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,455
Federal agents in New York

177
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
Have discovered this huge

178
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
Smuggling ring

179
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
There was a damaged crate

180
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
At JFK Airport

181
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,183
An Airline employee looked inside and saw something suspicious

182
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
Animal skin

183
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
A lot

184
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Of animal skin

185
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,303
And he called federal agent

186
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,863
And it turns out they're all these

187
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
Furs and pelts in there

188
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
100

189
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,983
Thousand illegal pelt

190
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,543
And they're literally from all over the world

191
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,847
South America Eastern Asia

192
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
South Asia

193
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,967
And it's leopard skins Jaguars Pumas cheetahs

194
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
The officials look at this

195
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,831
They sit down and do the calculations and they figure

196
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,879
That one tenth of the world

197
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
Cheetah population

198
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Is there

199
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Impel

200
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
110

201
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,279
Representatives at the conference were horrified

202
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,351
This is what happens when you can buy and sell animals

203
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:37,215
Not long after they signed a global set of restrictions on the trade of endangered species

204
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,031
And US The Endangered Species Act passes

205
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
The same year

206
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
Now even though this was prompted by trade in pelts

207
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Custom skins and Ivory

208
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,503
But the zoo Community this meant they had to change the way they did business

209
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,575
As you buy and sell endangered species

210
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,391
You need a permit and you have to prove

211
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,231
The buying and selling these animals is somehow going to benefit

212
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,535
Population that's out in the wild

213
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
Now that is really hard to prove

214
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
But there's a loophole

215
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
And that is that if you don't

216
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,543
Buy or sell them if you don't get money involved in this equation

217
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
Then you don't need a permit

218
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
This was specific

219
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,383
2 endangered species

220
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,967
Mizzou started to adopt these principles for most all of them

221
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Aquariums to

222
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,807
Let's just take money out of the equation

223
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,391
The rule became the animals should not be commodities

224
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Should not have a price

225
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Should not be paid

226
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
How

227
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
Do you get animal

228
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,119
Fill up all of these lovely zoos and Aquarium

229
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,471
Well there is one way to distribute resources without money

230
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
It's what we did before we had money

231
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
The oldest trick in the book

232
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Bartering

233
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,663
Gabriella and I went to an aquarium where they have

234
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,247
New England Aquarium is out on the waterfront

235
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
Boston and the centerpiece of the place

236
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,391
Is this amazing multi-storey

237
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,791
Yeah it's incredibly colorful it's a Caribbean coral reef and my favorite part was there.

238
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Giant turtle Myrtle the Turtle

239
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,655
It's just huge and it's been there for four decades

240
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Since the aquarium open

241
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,495
What are the advantages that aquariums have

242
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,799
Is that most of their animals that are not

243
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
So they can often go out of

244
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
Collect species

245
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,663
Make an occasional use money but

246
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
Aquarius try to trade and barter

247
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
For most of what you see on display

248
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,087
Are usually starts with something small

249
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
In the case of the New England Aquarium here in Boston

250
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
The basic unit of trade

251
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
Is the jelly

252
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,047
The New England Aquarium breed and barters

253
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
Hundreds of the little guy

254
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
Traders take us back to the vault

255
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,847
And the place looks like Jacques cousteau's living room there's tanks everywhere the sound of water pumps

256
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Roaring

257
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,687
And hundreds of beautiful translucent

258
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Jellyfish

259
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
Hanging out

260
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
Jellyfish

261
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Are your classic

262
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,623
Jelly designs a pulsating

263
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,927
Medusa with extremely long

264
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,791
Very diaphanous tentacles mouthparts that look like freely

265
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,095
Petticoats or

266
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
Unmentionables

267
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,959
Steve Bailey is a curator of fishes at the New England Aquarium

268
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
Every aquarium once a jelly

269
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
Evergreen with a lot of jellyfish

270
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
And Steve.

271
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,383
Which makes him I guess

272
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:29,759
The pretty rich man in the aquarium Fighter game

273
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,063
But it is a very inconvenient

274
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Form of my

275
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Here's how

276
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
Recently the curators had their eye

277
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
On this beautiful

278
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Oh they wanted

279
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
It is known as

280
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
The look down

281
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,983
It's a silvery schooling fish with a very unusual physiognomy it's

282
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Forehead is radically slow

283
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,895
And in their eyes are perched right at the edge of that plane and

284
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,455
They look like they're looking down

285
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
Grumpy dinner

286
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
If you can picture that

287
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,367
Now in aquarium in North Carolina

288
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
Had beef

289
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,231
But North Carolina wanted more than jellyfish

290
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
North Carolina

291
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
Wanted

292
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,119
So Boston had to go find the snipe fish

293
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
Which came to us

294
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
From Japan

295
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,287
That were the result of a trade for lumpfish

296
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,359
Boston Bruins and Grunts and in the end

297
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
We got lookdowns

298
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
Plain head files

299
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
Sombrero fish

300
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:40,415
Tarantulas look down

301
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
Samir grunts

302
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:48,351
By the time the truck rolls off the plaza there's probably been weeks and weeks if not months and months of disgust

303
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
If you wanted to see

304
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,959
What the world was like before money was invented

305
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
You should go to an aquarium

306
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
Bartering takes forever

307
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
But Steve says

308
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
This is what makes

309
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
It's so satisfying when you pull it off

310
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,967
What aquarium guys hang out at the bar at their meeting

311
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,271
They tell these incredible stories

312
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
Barter success

313
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
And Butterfield

314
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,391
We asked Steve what was his favorite trade

315
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,695
What was the trade he was most proud of

316
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,559
I would say that trading a school of mackerel for a flock of puffins

317
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,631
Was one of the best phrase that we

318
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,215
That we New England Aquarium lights LED

319
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,031
It managed to do

320
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
Dan do you remember how many puffins we got

321
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
Yeah it was at least a dozen

322
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
And how many Mac Williamson

323
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
800

324
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,527
When you did this trade and everyone knew

325
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
The puffin

326
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
The macro ratio

327
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
In the United States does that like set some sort of

328
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:50,047
Standard did everybody go out then and know like that is the official exchange rate from Michael puffins to the matter

329
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,375
No I think it's each institution could

330
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:59,007
Be considered a country in you operate with your own currency in the exchange rate is

331
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
Based on

332
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,591
The institution with whom you're dealing

333
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
I have to say

334
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,199
There is an easier way to do all this

335
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,991
Which is you could have just said

336
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,087
You know 600 macro are worth a thousand bucks

337
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,671
And the puffins are worth a thousand bucks and you could have just like done this through a bank

338
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Like

339
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,743
Well money your

340
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,303
Is money worth more to us than the animal

341
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
Bet you can't go out and buy puffins

342
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
So

343
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,191
We could have been sitting on a pile of

344
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,727
$100,000

345
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
And we still would have been puffing

346
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,615
You said school kids do not come to an aquarium to see a big pile of money

347
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
They come to see the

348
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
The look down

349
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
The jellyfish

350
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
And that's the beauty of this system

351
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
The collection of an aquarium

352
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,111
Is an asset that can be traded in loan

353
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
But it's also.

354
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,695
It's also how they make their real money

355
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
I should say the Sue's do things a little

356
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,815
They're a little more strict about their Adam

357
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
Yeah so they don't like the bartering cyst

358
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,983
They don't want to set this precedent that a panda is worth a thousand Turtles

359
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
Or whatever

360
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,407
Instead The Association of zoos and Aquariums has set up something that's kind of like a private Craigslist

361
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
It's called the animal likes

362
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
And it's a place

363
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Will you miss

364
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
What animals do you need and then you also list

365
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,855
Whatever animals you're trying to unload

366
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,463
Yeah you don't get money or even some sort of abstract credit when you give up an animal

367
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
You get basically

368
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Good Karma

369
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,583
You get a good relationship with another Zoo

370
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,911
Who might do you a favor might give you an animal down the line

371
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,983
It's like one of those take a penny leave a penny bowls

372
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
But without

373
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Speed elephant

374
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Gabriella

375
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Why don't you

376
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,639
Bring us up-to-date on what happened with those elephants

377
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:45,503
Canada Calgary decided it was time to give up their elephants and focus Alpha

378
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
Belize elephants

379
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
They needed a new home

380
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,159
So they call that the ACA the association of zoos and aquariums

381
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,255
And they drew up a list of possible zoos that might want these out

382
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
And then they took a road trip

383
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,679
They went and they visited all these issues they're different campuses they looked at the homes the dorms

384
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,263
And together the Aza and Calgary Zoo

385
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Picked a new home

386
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
And the winner

387
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
The National Zoo

388
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
In Washington DC

389
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,943
They build this big new elephant complex

390
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Wading pool

391
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
Sandbox

392
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,319
Their $2 donation to ship the elephants across the

393
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
The country home

394
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
Convoy

395
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Veterinarians the works

396
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
And of course

397
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
All that money spent

398
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
The price for the elephants

399
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
What's 0

400
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,839
I went to visit them here in DC

401
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
See in their new home

402
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
And the elephants they look pretty good

403
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:41,311
They're comfortable and actually kind of wrestling with one another figuring out the social dynamics

404
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,639
And the crowds were pretty happy to

405
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
S4 Calgary

406
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
On the balance sheet they were the losers

407
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
In this deal

408
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
Play Chris got no money for the elephant

409
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
But the karma system

410
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Did seem to work

411
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
Tell me that major respect

412
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
For putting the welfare of their elephants

413
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
For sending it to a better place

414
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
And lo and behold

415
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Other zoos

416
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,423
