12
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,200
Who was the president

13
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:26,368
1879 and 1879 the president was somebody that we've all heard about and nobody really knows y&r

14
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,904
Rutherford B Hayes

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,440
Rutherford B Hayes

16
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,488
Is is he the one with the

17
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,536
Long bushy sideburns

18
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,840
Or the long pointy beard

19
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:36,864
I'm trying to take

20
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:43,520
Can you really tell the difference between all those guys really what kind of stands out is James Garfield was a big player in this.

21
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,824
Because he has absolutely

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,104
Piercing blue eyes

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,896
Ice chip blue eyes

24
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
But the rest of them

25
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,712
Heather Cox Richard

32
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,952
And she said she was all the old presidents like she knows

33
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:02,976
Hudson's

34
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,536
I really know the old guys

35
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,584
Really well cuz I just live with

36
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
Who is your favorite President

37
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Abraham Lake

38
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,192
I have enough to ask

39
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,520
Okay but back to Rutherford

40
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
Heather says he's actually a surprise

41
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,664
Appraisingly important forgettable president because of

42
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
How he be

43
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
Became president

44
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,248
His election was super cat

45
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,040
This other guy sandals

46
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,064
Tilden had won the

47
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,928
Popular vote by a pretty big margin but people are saying Tilden only one because

48
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,000
Three Southern States weren't letting black voters vote

49
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
Even though this was against

50
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,072
It's the law black people at this point

51
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
We're supposed to be like today

52
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
But the Southern States

53
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,960
It's very intimidating and terrorizing black voters at

54
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
At the polls

55
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
Like by holding

56
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
Target practice

57
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Nearby

58
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Holy sites

59
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
South

60
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,896
Technically they're not

61
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,224
Stopping Black voting but you know if they're holding rifle practice

62
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,272
Chanel most people are going to show up

63
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,576
So government officials go down today

64
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856
Estates to figure out

65
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
Can we even trust these

66
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
And the Democrats

67
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Republicans

68
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,744
Are trying to work things out among themselves

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,816
Rutherford make some promises to them like he says

70
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,864
Kill point someone from their party to be

71
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,168
Postmaster General apparently that's

72
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,240
Really important back then you make some other promises but that is

73
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,568
Basically how he wins The Electoral College ultimately says

74
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
Yes Rutherford

75
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
You are now the

76
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:30,016
A lot of people already or calling him Rother fraud behaves because he's been elected by fraud

77
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,576
His accidency they called him

78
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:37,440
A Rutherford B Hayes Road accident see they called him his accidency yes I did

79
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
Name-calling

80
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
Impala

81
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
We've come so far

82
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,584
Okay so there are a ton of furious

83
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Democrats

84
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
Two thought they should have had

85
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
This election

86
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,496
And they're like we cannot let this happen again they set their eyes on the neck

87
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Presidential alert

88
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
And this time

89
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,104
They start zeroing in

90
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
On

91
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Soldier

92
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,688
You see there was a law on the books

93
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
What's that said if

94
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Enough black

95
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040
People complained about intimidation at polling

96
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
Places

97
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
The government would send

98
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
Soldiers to protect

99
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
At the time black voters tended

100
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
To vote Republican so Democrats hate this Soldier law there like if we didn't have federal soup

101
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Supervision

102
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
We could control

103
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
The outcomes

104
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Of our election

105
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
The South

106
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
And they come up with this idea

107
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
Something that has never been tried

108
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,104
Simply starve the government until they did what we wanted

109
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
By holding a gun to the head of the treasury

110
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
Democrats decide

111
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Stop funding

112
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
Unless

113
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,576
The country makes it up

114
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
Rhyme for the military to

115
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,648
Protect black voters

116
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
Kohl's

117
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,488
What did they call it back then did they call it a shutdown

118
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
No they called it the the rider Fighter the appropriation

119
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
Some people called it the writer

120
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
Horse and Rider is basically just

121
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
A provision that

122
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,288
Is tacked onto an Appropriations Bill headlines that said

123
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,640
This is the name of this particular event what there were we're headline saying

124
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
The Confederates have taken over our government

125
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:07,040
Because it really appeared to most people to be a continuation of the Civil War

126
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,952

129
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
To the first shutdown

130
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,287
When a bunch of Southerners tried to Ram through

131
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
Congress

132
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
They couldn't get done

Government shutdown

153
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
Ever we really need to take

154
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:13,599
In 1861 almost all of the southerners who were in Congress

155
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
Surrendered their seat

156
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,439
To go fight in the Civil War as Confederate

157
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
It's on the battlefield

158
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
To support slavery

159
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
And join their new government

160
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
Confederate States

161
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
America

162
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
Then Democrats were little

163
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,727
Different and Republicans were leading the charge for black rights

164
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:36,127
The Republicans are the ones who said we need to end the enslavement of other human beings and ultimately we need to

165
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,967
To guarantee that African-American men have the right to vote

166
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Civil War

167
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
They're totally powerless

168
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
They had

169
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
Left Congress

170
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
But the

171
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
You slowly start weaning there

172
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
Fourteen years after the war

173
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,559
They gained control of both Chambers

174
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:59,679
And just picture this we're talking about actual Confederate officers who

175
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
Who fought against the Union

176
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,543
So astonishing because really they've been fighting on the battlefield

177
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:09,919
For four years and this is not a little war just you know we're talking for years I just

178
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
Destroyed country

179
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,527
You know hundreds of thousands of dead billions lost

180
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
And

181
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:20,415
And these guys have literally been on the field shooting

182
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
At the same people that they're going to be sitting Within

183
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,815
In Congress we like actually shooting at people who were other congressmen

184
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,887
These are literally the same guys this is not like it mean

185
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,983
They weren't necessarily on the exact same battlefield but yes

186
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,335
These in Congress are people who wore the uniform for the United

187
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
What States government

188
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,663
Or for the Confederate States of America

189
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
And tried to kill each other

190
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
And with these Democrats

191
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
Couldn't do on the battlefield

192
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
They decide

193
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
They're going to do in Congress

194
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
Stop

195
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
Black rice

196
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
Only this time not

197
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
With air rifle

198
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
With their

199
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Per stream

200
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
Democrats

201
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
Hey president

202
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
Surfride we will fund the army

203
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,959
But only if it becomes illegal for the Army to print

204
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Tech black voters

205
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
At the polls

206
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,055
We will fund the courts

207
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,407
But only if it becomes illegal for the Army to protect black voters

208
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:20,319
Their number of cartoons in the newspapers about how the Confederates have taken back over Washington and how they are

209
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
Liberty starving the United States

210
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,927
Treasury the same way that they starved Union prisoner

211
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
Annies images

212
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:32,351
Prisoners as skeleton sing boy this feels awfully familiar what are Democrats saying at the time are they like

213
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,655
Really proud of this where they bragging about

214
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
Starving the government as a Setter shutting the government down

215
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
Absolutely

216
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,847
Southerners absolutely there like we are back in town

217
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,943
And we one of them literally gives interview to a newspaper and what she says

218
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:52,063
We were crazy to leave during the Civil War we should have just stayed in Congress and got in our way by not funding the government

219
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,623
But there is one member of Congress introduced

220
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
Angular who is Kelly Rutherford

221
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Be this

222
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,767
Is total intimidation you cannot cave

223
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
To the Democrats

224
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,679
James A Garfield from Ohio Civil War veteran is Garfield the one with the nice blue eyes that you

225
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
You keep mentioning

226
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
Exactly

227
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
Oh I can see the eyes

228
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,151
See what he looks like

229
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
Okay look at this

230
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
Okay but like if you had to

231
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,087
To cheer the cute president from the late 19th century I don't I don't think you would be the

232
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
James A Garfield

233
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:33,535
Timmy takes the 19th century cake but whatever he was the minority leader of the House of Representatives are Republican

234
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
And he says

235
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,423
This is completely outrageous Democrats can't get what they want through the normal process

236
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
So they are just

237
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Destroying

238
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
The government

239
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,847
Hayes and Garfield look at what they're doing and they say this is Revolution

240
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
And this is revolutionary

241
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:55,295
And this is a complete perversion of the way the American government is supposed to work you affection cannot shut down

242
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Down the government

243
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
Cannot

244
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
Starve the United States government to death

245
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
To get its way

246
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,535
Once you have admitted that as a legitimate tactic of governance

247
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
You've destroyed our America

248
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
Constitution CB is

249
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Condense

250
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
He needs to

251
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Dig Inn

252
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
No compra

253
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Rather be

254
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,871
We feel very bad that rather fraud has take all these years so we're rebranding are rather friend

255
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,431
Notorious rbh writes in his diary

256
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
This will be a severe

257
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
Perhaps a long

258
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
I do not fear it

259
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,087
I do not

260
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
Even Reddit

261
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,927
Damn yeah

262
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,255
Now every time the Democrats try to sneak in this

263
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
Ryder this

264
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
No more

265
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
Protection for black voters at the

266
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,143
Kohl's recipe comes in with a v

267
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
He vetoes five

268
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,775
Bill's Democrats eventually give in and end up funding all but

269
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
One small part of the

270
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,687
It's basically a very many shut down and Rutherford B Hayes to Claire's

271
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
Victory says the Democrats didn't want to fund

272
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,831
The Army the executive and legislative branches

273
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
And Republicans

274
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Stop that

275
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
Heather says it's

276
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,719
It's hard to track down the precise

277
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
Date this shutdown end

278
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,047
And it but she doesn't really doesn't matter

279
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,655
A couple hundred Court workers weren't paid but they basically just build the government later

280
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
This was not a fight about

281
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
This was a fight

282
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
About principles

283
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,823
Taking the government hostage felt

284
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
So radical

285
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,175
So over-the-top and ultimately so pointless that

286
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,783
No one tries this tactic again for almost a hundred

287
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
People recognize that

288
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,623
You could not governed by extremism

289
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:40,255
And that system of government really didn't happen again until the modern era because there was a

290
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
The premium on

291
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:47,167
Abiding by our constitutional norms and by working things out between the different parties that wanted different things

292
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
But apparently

293
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
A hundred years

294
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
Is just long enough

295
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
To forget the lessons of History

296
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Budget rules change in the night

297
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
1970s and shutdown start to

298
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Wheat back in

299
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Bit by bit

300
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
There are

301
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
A few small shut down

302
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
70s

303
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:07,135
80s but it was house Speaker Newt Gingrich who returned the shutdown

304
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,695
To it's fully weaponized status in the 90

305
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
He use the tactic

306
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,047
Weiss and at one point close the government

307
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
For 21 days

308
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,887
That set the record for the longest shutdown

309
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Ever

310
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Until

311
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Now

312
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Shut down

313
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
Are back

314
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
And what's significant about the rise of the

315
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:30,431
Tactic of shutting down the government the present is it once again it's being Advanced by absolute

316
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,223
Spike's dream is to say

317
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,295
We don't want to compromise we want things our way

318
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,879
And that is not part of our American system which

319
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
Has checks and balances that has rules

320
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,231
Heather posted an 11 parts

321
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
Thread on Twitter

322
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
About the similarities

323
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,863
Between the current government shutdown over border wall

324
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
And the very first shut down

325
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Black voter

326
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
She says

327
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,007
This is what Hayes and Garfield

328
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
Do it again

329
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,103
People who had convinced themselves that what they wanted

330
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,663
Was worth making everyone suffer

331
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,967
The idea that a few people

332
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,063
Few men a few white men should control American society

333
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
Is not at all unlike

334
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,207
The ideologies of the people currently in charge of the Republican Party

335
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,559
And that argument that in fact they are the ones who should

336
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Say what is right

337
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
For America despite what the rest of us think

338
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
Is not

339
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
At all unlike with the Confederates were doing in 1879

340
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,663
Always should say that Heather describes herself as a Lincoln Republican and she says she gets hate mail

341
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Dolphin boats

342
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
But Tesla

343
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
Criticizing the current government

344
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
Shutdown is not about her purse

345
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
This is just a terrible.

346
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
Tactic it never works

347
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:50,559
And what it does is it backfires on the faction that does it

348
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,887
So the people who are backing the shutdown

349
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Essentially

350
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Have to opt

351
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,263
They either have to be assuming that they're going to be able to

352
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,383
To control government entirely that is take over the government and never let anybody else in it

353
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
Which is a terrifying thought

354
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,271
Or they have to assume that their faction is going to go down in flames be

355
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Because

356
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,599
There has never been a case where

357
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:18,207
Shutdown has ultimately ended in making that faction look better than

358
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
And it did before

359
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,839
The former Confederate Democrats who orchestrated the very first shut down

360
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:29,215
They didn't get what they wanted out of it they didn't stop soldiers from protecting black voters at polls

361
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,615
Of course yes they did later get what they wanted by making it so hard for African Americans to even register

362
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
What about

363
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
But

364
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
Didn't get that

365
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Through the shutdown

366
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
Of 18/7

367
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
By the way we did try to find out

368
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:55,327
The exact moment that the first shutdown ended because of the center for legislative archives

369
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
Unfortunately we are closed

370
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Normal operation

371
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
Due to a lack of appropriation

372
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
I'm shut down

373
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Support for NPR

374
