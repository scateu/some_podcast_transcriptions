1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,816
John Grant grew up in Seattle

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:03,840
Loved his hometown

3
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,120
We have

4
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,656
Mountains we have

5
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,680
Beautiful bodies

6
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,960
Water

7
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,752
Also knew the city had flaws

8
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,568
When I was growing up walking the streets of Seattle

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,872
It also had this enormous homeless

10
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
Population

11
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,944
Seattle has been struggling with housing

12
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,504
And this became John's key issue

13
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,296
He did community outreach

14
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,576
For the homeless he worked

15
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:29,952
For the tenants Union in 2015 John decided to take his first stab at local politics

16
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,512
He decided to run for City Council

17
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,792
So we sat down

18
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,816
And figure it out

19
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,584
How to find

20
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,888
You make a list of everybody you know

21
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
That could potentially

22
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,728
Donate the maximum amount which

23
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,776
Back then was $700

24
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,056
And

25
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,616
You go to that list pretty quick

26
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,408
It was Dawning on John that

27
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,456
Working with the Homeless was not

28
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,272
The kind of job that connected him with a lot of Rich donors

29
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,064
He managed to get

30
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
Mostly small donation

31
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,904
1015-25 $50

32
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,184
Small grass

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,488
Donations and John was facing the

34
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,072
Classic well-funded incumbent who is pulling in donations

35
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:12,960
Tech giants like Amazon Insurance in pharmaceutical companies from Real Estate Developers

36
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
In the end

37
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,824
John Grant managed to scrape together $75,000

38
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,128
His opponent

39
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,408
Raise 5

40
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
X out of

41
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,760
If we just had the resources to get our message out to more voters

42
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,344
It's pretty clear to me at least that we would have won that race

43
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,648
Yeah John did not win the race

44
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,536
And of course this is what happened it is one of the most depressing things about American politics

45
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
The people

46
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
John wanted to represent

47
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,400
They were people who didn't have money to donate

48
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
Buy business interest

49
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,240
They can donate all day long and

50
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,312
Unfortunately that is just the way the cyst

51
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
That is

52
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,896
Until Seattle decided

53
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
To break

54
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
The system

55
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Kenny Malone and today I am joined by Sarah Kliff

56
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
Most of vox's the impact podcast and herself a Seattle in Seattle

57
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Seattle light

58
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:17,472
We are joining forces with the impact because they just launched a new season and are here to tell the story

59
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,520
What happens when Seattle lights

60
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,616
Try to solve one of the most fundamental problems in American politics

61
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
Less money you have

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
The less people

63
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:32,064
In the wave Seattle decided to deal with this wasn't to take big money out of politics

64
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,392
It was too flooded their elections with small money

65
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,304
Today on the show The Seattle experiment it's a story that test everything you thought you knew about the way

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
Way our political system

67
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,936
And also there will be talking dogs

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Support for this podcast

69
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,896
In the following message come from the Annie E Casey

70
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Sea Foundation

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
Developing Solutions

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
It support strong families and community

73
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,320
To help ensure a brighter future for America's shield

74
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,904
More information is available at aecf. Org

75
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,256
So of course if you are going to introduce a

76
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,096
Crazy new program the only way to teach people about it

77
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Is with us

78
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
Super Ernest

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
Public service

80
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,032
The city of Seattle is giving eligible Seattle residence

81
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,848
$100 in democracy vouchers

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
They can use to

83
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Support

84
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,736
Oh my God why is it always like terrible acoustic music

85
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:39,136
I don't understand why so many good bands Nirvana Pearl Jam Pearl Jam could have made a PSA

86
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
Anyway

87
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
Here is what that PSA is

88
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
In 2050

89
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
Seattle residents agreed to raise property

90
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,656
So that the city couldn't send money

91
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,216
Every single Seattle light

92
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,520
Half a million seattleites

93
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
Right everyone will get

94
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,384
For $25 vouchers that they could donate to candidates

95
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
And Seattle called these things

96
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Democracy

97
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
So you're the man

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
The voucher program fellow

99
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,648
Yes Wayne Burnett is the executive director of the

100
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
The Seattle at

101
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
10 elections,

102
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,976
He was told

103
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
It is your job

104
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
To somehow make this

105
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Democracy voucher

106
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Your program work

107
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,679
I was excited on one level because it is very an Innovative program

108
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
But at the same time it was

109
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
Kind of terrifying

110
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
Because it is

111
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Innovative program

112
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
One of the first things waynehead

113
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
To do was just like

114
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,687
Think through what are the goals of this program

115
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,223
And there were a lot

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
Increasing small donations

117
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Changing who donates

118
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:44,159
Giving candidates a financial incentive to actually go out and meet voters

119
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
So when his team get

120
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Designing

121
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,535
Voucher the envelopes are going to come in

122
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
And pretty quickly they realized

123
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
Even tiny decisions

124
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Are

125
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,679
There's been a big

126
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
Debate here about weather

127
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
They're not that made sense

128
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,031
Postage paid envelope

129
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
Paid postage envelope

130
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
Seems totally trivia

131
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:08,223
But if you're trying to get more people to donate money why would you make it harder

132
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
For people to use their vouchers than its

133
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Great

134
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
It definitely makes sense

135
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
To have returned post

136
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,183
The counter that is we should be encouraging

137
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
Contact

138
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
Between

139
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Candidates

140
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
And the public

141
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,095
Write another one of the program's goals was to get

142
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Candidates to act

143
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
Actually go out and talk to voters

144
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,471
To tell him about issues and then ask for donations

145
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,543
That might not happen if people can just mail their donations in

146
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
Eventually they decided okay fine better to in

147
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Include the stamp butt

148
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,967
The point is Wayne and his team we're redesigning Seattle

149
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
Entire campaign Finance system

150
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
And that is not easy

151
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,855
Alright so this is the

152
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,159
This isn't that the envelope that included the voucher

153
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,951
When should be the final product

154
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
It's an envelope with vouchers in it in it

155
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
It says $100

156
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,351
Seattle voters were going to receive for blue and white

157
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Pieces of paper

158
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
They look kind of like checks

159
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
Essentially work like

160
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,007
You write the name of the candidate you want to donate

161
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,335
And then you sign your democracy voucher over to that key

162
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,199
The first week of 2017 Wayne Burnett steam put these vouchers in the mail

163
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
And this was unprecedented

164
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
No one in the country had tried anything like this

165
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,111
Seattle with flooding it's mailboxes

166
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
With millions of dollars

167
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
Worth of fake money

168
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
They could magically turn into real money

169
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
Four candidates

170
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
Here we go

171
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,631
City council position 8 and we have the two candidates

172
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
And we will start off

173
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Sabbatical

174
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
Alright the alphabetical advantage

175
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
Remember John Graham

176
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,055
That advocate for the homeless

177
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Ran for the city

178
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
Council and lost

179
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:44,735
Well-funded opponent well after Seattle launched this radical funding

180
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,807
John Grant decided to get back in the game

181
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
This is him from

182
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
A candidate forum

183
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:55,999
I put forward a proposal requiring 25% of all new development to be affordable to working-class people

184
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
I have also put

185
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
This time around

186
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,863
John wasn't running against a well-funded in

187
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
You got a different kind

188
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Thank Jah

189
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,031
So one of the things that I'm calling for is

190
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,847
Real solutions Teresa Moscato

191
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
A first-time candidate

192
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,783
I'm calling for us to take every parcel of developable available land and turn it into a four

193
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,647
Affordable housing now thing about Visionary Civic programs to empower underdogs

194
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:29,535
Sure they help out underdogs like John Grant but they also bring out brand-new underdogs

195
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
Looks like

196
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Teresa Moscato

197
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
I'm a woman

198
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
I'm a person of color

199
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
I'm a renter I still pay student loans

200
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
I'm 37

201
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
That someone like me wasn't going to be a

202
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
Expected to sell

203
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
Finance a campaign

204
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
Really was a green light

205
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,479
Lego arguably the Democracy vouchers were already working

206
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,295
The two candidates vying for this City Council seat

207
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,855
Both would have had trouble raising money in the pack

208
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
But now

209
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,719
John Grant and Teresa Mosqueda just needed to get out there

210
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
To knock on doors

211
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,559
And convince voters to hand over their voucher

212
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:08,191
Do you remember the first door you knocked on and asked for the voucher who really do remember that door

213
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,007
John Grant says there was a newspaper reporter

214
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
Tagging along

215
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
Watching this historic moment

216
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,663
One of the first times anyone ever has asked for democracy

217
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,991
Jonathan this rapidly gentrifying neighbor

218
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
And

219
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:28,415
Sweet we knock on the door and this this guy hit a mustache I don't know why I remember that but I do

220
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,975
Just a gentleman with a mustache

221
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,791
Looks at me and I gave him my my picture about

222
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
Are housing crisis center

223
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,143
Eventually John turns the conversation to

224
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
The Democracy vouchers

225
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
May I ask for you know $100 in democracy vouchers

226
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
Because I looked at me and he also looked at the reporter and

227
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
Was like sure

228
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,479
And he gave me one hit me one $25 voucher

229
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
And

230
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,319
Close this door I knock

231
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,391
The rest of the block and that was the only voucher that I got that today

232
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:04,511
Answer the reporter was like is that it and I'm like that's it

233
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,839
To be fair John's luck got better over the next

234
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,935
Few weeks meanwhile Teresa Mosqueda is also out there knocking on doors

235
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,495
She remembers voters being genuinely sad

236
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
Surprised that a real candidate

237
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,311
Would show up in purse

238
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,663
It's really you on this flyer you're here at my door and I was like yeah as a migrant

239
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Disney myself

240
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
And there's a hold on I'll be right back

241
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,319
Find the Democracy vouchers in a pile on their table of mail

242
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
And they come back and they

243
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,367
Fill it out there right at the

244
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,671
Edwin door-knocking went like this

245
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,463
The program was great

246
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
But

247
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,047
Has these candidates for canvassing

248
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
It started to become clear

249
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
The voucher program

250
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
Had a pretty big problem

251
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,495
Imagine if you will knocking on the apartment door of the

252
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
Ross in Dallas

253
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,407
Hi Ross analysis

254
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
Are young they're politically engaged

255
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
They are the exact

256
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
Kind of Voters that John Grant

257
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,063
Teresa mosquito would love

258
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
To win over

259
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
And yet

260
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,671
If John or Teresa had shown up to their house

261
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
And asked about

262
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
The vouchers I don't want to say

263
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,839
You definitely threw them away

264
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,423
I know I definitely remember getting it in the mail because

265
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
It said it looks yeah

266
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
It seemed a lot of Seattle lights

267
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
We're like Alice

268
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
They're getting these vouchers

269
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
Mistaking them for junk mail

270
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
And then throwing the

271
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
What candy was Seattle they were

272
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Recycling

273
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,271
Remember the program has never been attempted

274
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,111
From lot of people the idea of cutting $100

275
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
In the mail

276
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,695
From their government to reform campaign Finance

277
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Was

278
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
Too good to be true

279
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
But it wasn't just

280
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,815
Regular old photos getting

281
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,655
Frankly I thought it was news about recycling so I recycled it

282
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
That's right

283
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,543
Even city council candidate Teresa Moscato recycled her vouchers

284
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
And home

285
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151
Later did I think to myself

286
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,223
I think that might be the vouchers and I went back and pulled it out

287
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
And I think here it would help

288
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
To talk about the

289
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,831
The design of the envelope that these

290
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
Came in eye

291
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:12,511
Have a copy in the studio with us right now it's like as long as a normal envelope little taller a little bit fatter to be on

292
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,815
Honest it kind of looks like a thing you get from

293
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,631
Publishers Clearing House there is an official

294
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,215
Seattle City logo appear and then also it says

295
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,263
Your democracy vouchers are here

296
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:29,919
We look at it with wind burn at the guy in charge of deciding the envelope the program the whole thing

297
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
It has an opening envelope

298
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,039
And then a circle with the number $100 in

299
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,087
Brett I'm going to be honest Wayne

300
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
I think I would throw this away

301
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
Will you did a lot of other people

302
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975
That might be an undersea

303
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
Statement win estimates that about

304
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,815
75% of

305
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,631
Seattleites either Thruway or misplaced

306
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Their democracy

307
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
You could have written on this

308
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Don't throw this away

309
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
Are usually

310
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
At first I didn't know they were ski

311
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Cancel work like one

312
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,455
But you could have tried something like that did anybody float that I don't think so

313
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
Just brainstorming okay

314
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Spitballing

315
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
Spitballing

316
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
The trash problem was a huge prop

317
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
But it was not always fault

318
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,487
The way this program was written up required that these vouchers go out in January

319
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
2017

320
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,559
That was 10 months

321
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Before the actual election

322
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
But as reports started to come in that

323
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
Maybe this is a bigger problem than you thought

324
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
When is office

325
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,567
Okay we're going to run a campaign to remind

326
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,127
People there is a way to replace lost out

327
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,199
They printed up a bunch of posters that looks like

328
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Somebody had lost

329
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
A dog except

330
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
Instead of a dog there was a picture of

331
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,367
Democracy vouchers and then a pro democracy voucher group

332
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
Also made some ads about lost voucher

333
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,743
That's my human she's looking for democracy vouchers

334
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
This had with also dog

335
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,119
Featured a talking French bulldog in a red vest

336
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,447
Bitstamp around explaining how to replace your lost democra

337
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
Mercy doctors

338
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,775
By the dog's owner digs through the couch cushions

339
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
For her loss.

340
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,639
But she's not going to find them because I ate them

341
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,247
But it's not a big deal all she has to do is called 2:06

342
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:15,903
It's so good what is up with all the dog heads in Seattle though I don't understand

343
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,951
It took a lot of work but

344
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Seattle

345
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,999
Eventually

346
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
Dealt with the Lost voucher

347
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
The advertisements

348
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,167
Of course but they also gave John and Teresa away

349
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Need to show up at people's doors

350
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
Send help them replace lost voucher

351
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
On the spot

352
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
And that man

353
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
John and Teresa were collecting serious money

354
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,895
Remember the first time John ran

355
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
Before democracy vouchers

356
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,991
He only raised about $75,000

357
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,807
That entire year I

358
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
I didn't have a staff

359
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
It was just me

360
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,159
But in 2017

361
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
John raised

362
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
$300,000

363
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
In democracy

364
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,839
I had a campaign manager at a field director

365
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:01,215
Field organizers and you know we knocked on $50,000 and that's a lot of one-on-one conversations

366
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
What's realtor

367
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
And John's opponent

368
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,663
Teresa Mesquita remember she was a first-time candidate you still paying off your student loans brand new to this stuff

369
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,967
And itchy also managed to raise

370
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
$300,000

371
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Democracy voucher

372
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
So if you actually I can show you

373
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
Chart that shows

374
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
How much money came in

375
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,231
And she showed me the chart so I could see how little of her own money

376
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
She had to put into the campaign

377
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
It's 361.

378
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
So that is B

379
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,911
Because I spent $250 of my own

380
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Text myself

381
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,775
I use a hundred of my democracy.

382
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,079
And then there was an $11 face

383
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,919
So that's worth 306

384
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
$51

385
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,039
Is what I paid and after 10 months of democracy voucher problems

386
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
And solutions

387
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
Election day finally came and

388
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
The campaigns were

389
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Teresa Moscato

390
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
She remembers being at our watch party

391
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
Looking up at the TV

392
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,839
And it showed us at that night at 62% of the vote

393
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,447
And people were just jumping with joy screaming hugging each other

394
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
And then we had a mariachi band

395
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,127
It was amazing oh hell yeah

396
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
Teresa ended up beating John Grant

397
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
But honestly either of these candidates was a win for

398
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
For democracy.

399
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
Neither was an established

400
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Politician

401
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,135
Neither could rely on a long list of

402
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Rich donors

403
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,231
The bandar campaigns they actually knocked on Doors

404
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
And met voters

405
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,583
Changing who runs for office getting candidates out into

406
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
The community

407
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,191
These were goals of the program but arguably the most important matter

408
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Patrick was

409
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,287
Did people actually use these vouchers

410
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
Were there more people donating

411
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,383
Two campaigns what is different

412
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:49,503
About the number of people donating in Seattle now that you guys have democracy vouchers

413
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,879
Well bottom line is a dramatically increase the number of campaign country contributors

414
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,183
Again Wayne Barnett the guy in charge

415
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,119
Triple we had roughly eighteen thousand people who contributed and sure that's a lot of people

416
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
But

417
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
As Sarah pointed out to Wayne

418
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Seattle

419
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
500000 residue

420
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
So I know it is

421
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,615
True Wayne that increase the number of contributors

422
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,967
What's also true that 97% of people didn't use their democracy

423
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Christie vouchers

424
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
You know it is if the glass half-full glass

425
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Half-empty thing

426
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,391
Classic on the one hand we had more contributors than ever

427
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,695
On the other hand we still did not have

428
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,535
Participation at the levels that the framers of the program had hoped

429
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
But I am a glass-half-full

430
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,655
I just want to drink the empty half of

431
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
What is class though because like

432
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,263
Everyone got free money to give away

433
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
And basically nobody did it like

434
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
The vast majority

435
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
That makes me feel worse

436
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,015
Like I said we increased our number of contributors

437
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Dramatically

438
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
To me that is

439
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
Success

440
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
I will

441
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Readily

442
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
Admit if it is

443
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
In the third or fourth

444
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,023
Cycle of the program if we are not seeing

445
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,815
More participation

446
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Maps

447
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
I think that might actually

448
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
Cut the other way

449
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
All that being said

450
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,263
When will admit there is a pretty reasonable

451
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Critique of the pro

452
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,079
It is not a cheap

453
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
Program to run

454
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,663
If there are a lot of costs associated with

455
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,223
Printing mailing and processing these vouchers

456
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,551
Which hopefully we can reduce once we get

457
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,855
Electronic system in place but

458
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
I would

459
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
Tell you that it is not too cheap for

460
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
In 2017

461
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
Seattle lights

462
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,047
Gave candidates about $1000000 in

463
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
In democracy

464
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
The administration of the whole program

465
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
What's also about $1000000

466
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,543
That means half of the Democracy voucher money went to administrate

467
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,639
And those are taxpayer dollars that could fund other things like

468
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
Schools are roads are

469
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
Affordable housing

470
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,551
Oswin said they are moving to an electronic system for the next election

471
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
Stomach cut out

472
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
Printing and mailing costs

473
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,951
The first they have to build the electronic

474
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
Excess demand that cost

475
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
Even more money

476
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,791
So when admits there

477
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Are definitely

478
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
Bleach write-offs

479
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Yeah

480
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
But I mean I think

481
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,727
The question is your municipality are they willing to

482
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,567
To pay 2 to get more people involved in the political process

483
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,639
Seattle made the decision that were willing to

484
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Pay for that

485
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Good

486
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,223
I think that's every music

487
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,039
Right exactly

488
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,367
Seattle appears to have weighed the pros and cons for itself

489
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
And has decided

490
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
Democracy vouchers

491
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
Are worth it

492
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,743
There'll be some tweaks for the city

493
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
Is going to continue with

494
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
One final quick

495
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,143
Story about why Seattle might have decided this

496
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
Was a success

497
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,983
It is true that not as many people use the vouchers

498
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
Set the city hope

499
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,823
But a lot of people who did use the vouchers

500
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,407
There's the kind of people who don't have a lot of power in American

501
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,759
They were able to exercise their voice in a totally new way

502
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
There was this one woman I met in

503
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,111
In Seattle who really drove this point home for me

504
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
Her name is Gina Owens

505
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
And I'm

506
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
60

507
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
Years Young

508
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
Gina have been politically active

509
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
4 years

510
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,399
She worked on housing and Healthcare issues

511
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,751
But before 2017 Gina has never donated to a campaign

512
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
She's on disability

513
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,335
Takes care of her 3 grandkids

514
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,175
So right now my finances are under $2,000 a month

515
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:34,015
Then raising three kids know that was no way I was going to find that huh

516
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
The dollar

517
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,135
It would not go to a candidate

518
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,927
When Gina got her democracy

519
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
She took them to a candidate for us

520
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
She wanted to give them to John Grant

521
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
Actually

522
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,399
I kind of made a big deal out of it

523
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,703
She waited until the Forum was over

524
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
Locked up

525
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,287
To the podium where they were all sitting and

526
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
David

527
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
Two vouchers

528
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,431
So how did it make you feel to have the opportunity to do that for the first time

529
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,015
Bill Gates

530
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:17,279

Seattle South Carolina Vermont that have

538

558
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,104
One of the interesting things about the actual design of these

559
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
Is

560
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,480
But there's a little bit of language that is like a subtle reminder

561
