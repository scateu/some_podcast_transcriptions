00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,456
In 2002

8
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,736
Tim Damaris noticed that

9
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,504
Sales at his

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,272
Company

11
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,040
We're slipping

12
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,576
And he couldn't figure out why

13
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,368
Tim was working for

14
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,672
Small company in Indiana called

15
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,952
They make things

16
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:35,072
That handy people keep in their garage epoxy glue spark plugs

17
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,352
Engine degreaser

18
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:40,960
And Tim's job was to travel the world going anywhere he could sell a broke

19
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,056
I was allowed to go as long as I could as long as we brought back business and

20
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,128
We felt like Buccaneers going to these Emerging Markets

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,664
Congo in the

22
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,200
And then in Russian

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
Ghana Cameroon

24
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,784
Maybe you've never heard of a bro

25
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,064
I certainly hadn't

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088
That's because

27
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,112
None of the stuff that makes

28
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,904
Actually get sold in the US

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
But it's really popular

30
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,464
And a lot of other play

31
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,024
Places where made in America

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,304
Carrie's extra cash

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,400
Today when you refer to a roll of masking tape in Pakistan

34
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,960
They simply asked can you get me a roll of a bro

35
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,264
Big deal in Pakistan

36
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
Anyways

37
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,592
Tim couldn't figure this out

38
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,384
Why were his sales

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,152
Slipping

40
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
And then

41
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,504
He heard from a customer who had seen some counterfeit Abra Prada

42
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
China

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,832
Tim gets on a plane to investigate

44
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
Its first.

45
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,672
Is this trade show that everyone in his business ghost

46
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,512
Canton Trade Fair is one of the largest trade fairs in the world

47
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,096
His first day there Tim's walking around this massive exhibition

48
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
Hunting for Clues

49
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168
And then suddenly

50
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,752
Freezes I peered around the corner hiding really behind a booth

51
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,080
And I looked around and I was literally

52
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,896
Shocked to see what I was in front of me

53
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,200
In front of Tim is a booth that

54
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
Looks to be

55
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
Inoperable

56
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
The thing is Hatboro never

57
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,344
G4 booth at this Fair

58
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,440
It's a same logo same colors and products same everything

59
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
Only

60
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
No one inside the booth

61
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
Actually

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
Worked at Abra

63
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
They were passing out a burl business cards

64
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,448
Abril catalogs with all our products in it

65
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:22,336
To my arrow customers that were visiting so it was total confusion oh my God they were telling people they were the

66
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
Abro subsidiary in

67
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,200
China Tim knows Arrow doesn't have a subsidiary in

68
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
So we go

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
Straight to the show officials

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,904
He provides documents showing a bro has a real trademark registration for a bro in China

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
The officials confirmed this with authorities in Beijing

72
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,000
And then boom

73
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
Favorite

74
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
They will raid

75
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Get the fake aerobus

76
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
We had police Personnel

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,776
There were military personnel because the military guys in this Entourage strain

78
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,360
Absolutely absolutely because the military is part of

79
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,408
These trade shows in China because they

80
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
I want some of the companies

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
So I'm

82
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,784
Marching I've been leading my Army a men

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,648
I feel like a gentle going to battle I mean it was kind of scary but it's kind of exciting Tim gets to the booth

84
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:11,744
And get right up in the face of the man who seems to be in charge of the operation

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
I said

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,816
The party's over Mister Avril

87
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,888
Is here then the Chinese guy turns to him and says

88
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
Is very calmly

89
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
No

90
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Your

91
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,544
He reaches into a briefcase and pulls out a set of documents

92
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
He says shows

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
She is the one

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
Who owns the Avro trademark

95
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Mark in China

96
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
Everyone just sort of

97
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
Looks around at each other

98
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
Stunt

99
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,600
And the show official start backing off they don't know who to believe he

100
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
But Tim

101
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
To know something they don't know

102
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
He points to a four foot tall poster inside the booth it's a blown-up photograph of a woman who appears on every page

103
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
Package of a burl epoxy glue

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,936
I said the older who is that woman you have the photo

105
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,496
He said that just Western model

106
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,032
Have that phone

107
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
I lost

108
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
I just lost

109
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,920
I said that is not a western model that is my wife

110
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,528
And that time I just ripped out my wallet I pull out a picture

111
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,088
Tell my wife I be careful last 3 years

112
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,416
It's throw it on the table in front of the owner of the company

113
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,488
I said first you steal our corporate identity

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
I know you're stealing my wife

115
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,887
Elsa I've been playing this moment over and over in my head

116
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
It's like that moment

117
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
In Good Will Hunting where Matt Damon

118
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Goes up to the guy and he's like

119
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,567
Yeah well I got her number how do you like them apples

120
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
The next day the

121
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
Fake eyebrow Booth is empty

122
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
With a sad piece of tarp

123
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
Flow rate over

124
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
So

125
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
Was that the end of the story

126
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,695
I wish it was but that was only the beginning of the story

127
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
Hello and welcome to Planet Money

128
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
I'm Nick. And I know

129
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
There's a story that's taken hold

130
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
About China

131
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
Little something like this

132
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,935
China is

133
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,007
Garbage at protecting intellectual property

134
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
But eyebrows story is

135
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
Yeah the reason I even know about

136
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,735
Because last year when the Trump Administration was collecting horror stories about American companies screwed over by

137
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
China

138
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,295
Abro raises hand

139
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Instead

140
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
China is doing a great job

141
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
We were like

142
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
What

143
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
We want to hear that story

144
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143

Capital One na

154
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
So Tim gets back to the US and he's telling anyone who will listen about how he took down his chai

155
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Chinese counterfeiters

156
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
With a picture of his wife

157
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Yeah

158
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
About that

159
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511
Few months later Tim is in Saudi Arabia

160
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,071
Walking through Market when he see something that looks

161
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
Like AB Rosa Parks

162
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,423
But you notice is there something different about the packaging

163
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,215
Right where that picture of his wife

164
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
Usually appears

165
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
The woman had an Asian face

166
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:09,151
They kept the same outfit my wife is wearing but just cut her head off and put the Asian face in there

167
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:14,271
Wait till it was your wife's body on the bottom with an a

168
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,319
At the jogger fit waist body

169
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
Asian face

170
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
Brake lever

171
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
It's just so petty

172
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
Fake eyebrow took Tim's

173
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
How do you like them apples moment

174
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,815
It said how do you like them apples right back

175
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
And that right there

176
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
Is the moment that Tim daoust

177
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Himself

178
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
You guys down

179
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,263
My wife's picture is the face that launched a thousand lawsuits

180
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,823
But the for a broken bring any lawsuit

181
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Against fake abro

182
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,407

Magic

187
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
The person at the top of Hunan Magic

00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
Is a man named un homework

189
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
Tim realizes

190
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
He's actually method

191
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
He's the one Tim confronted

192
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:03,679
Inside the booth in China you're going to be hearing a lot about you and homeway and Hunan match

193
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,495
Taking this story and we wanted you to hear their side

194
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,359
But after a long back and forth they decided they didn't want to talk to us so

195
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
According to Tim

196
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
The next thing that happens

197
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
Is Avril filed a lawsuit

198
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
In Chinese court against

199
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Hunan Magic

200
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
But it's slow going

201
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
In the whole time

202
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
The Apple brand

203
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
All around the world

204
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Is taking a beating

205
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,439
Emily came out with circle

206
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,999
Other parks that we'd even have like a rat poison

207
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,791
They call it a burl rat poison

208
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
They were doing all kinds of wild

209
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,959
He said the product Hunan magic is selling Under The Apple brand they're horrible

210
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,751
Apple glue for example

211
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
Normally

212
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,823
Has a shelf life of one year minimum

213
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,103
Hunan Magic

214
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,943
Counterfeit glue would get hard in the tube within days

215
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
Whoever decides

216
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
It needs another

217
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
Rose Hunan magic could end up killing their business

218
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,367
It was time to bring in the

219
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Professionals

220
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
Easy Pulp Fiction

221
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
Yeah

222
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,279
Okay so when they got the two dead bodies in the back of the car you call in the wall

223
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
We were kind of like that portrayed by

224
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,703
Bill Mansfield is a former private investigator who helps people with

225
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
Special trademark

226
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
When a lawsuit just isn't enough

227
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
He used to go undercover as

228
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
The counterfeiters

229
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
Usually a Russian for

230
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
For whatever reason

231
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
To collect Intel on badly behaving com

232
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,015
Bill will be the first to tell you though

233
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,831
He does not look the part of a typical badass

234
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,159
I'm perfectly round I'm A Perfect Circle if you saw me

235
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
You mean your

236
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
Your rotund

237
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
I am I am

238
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
I am a

239
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
Sphere

240
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
With legs and arms

241
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
And we'll head on

242
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,679
Wake mr. happy you know the book character

243
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
Yes okay yes

244
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
What is work though

245
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
She is not so mister

246
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
He tells a bro

247
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
The surest way to get these guys to stop

248
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
You got to make it hard

249
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
You got to make counterfeiting

250
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,319
So costly so painful that the counterfeiters will have no choice but the backup

251
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
And so far

252
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
That's just not happening in China Seville says

253
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,719
I didn't bring these guys on to home turf

254
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:07,071
He digs around and finds an obscure law in Louisiana

255
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
Which is incredibly harsh when it comes to

256
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Counterfeiters

257
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
Like down there

258
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
You can get sentenced to

259
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
The hard labor

260
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
Counterfeit

261
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,359
Okay so you were looking at that and you're thinking I could get you in home way

262
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
On a chain gang

263
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
That is my goal

264
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
Yes

265
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,015
Because because the system

266
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
He was in

267
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,391
It wasn't tutoring him in any way but Tennille you at home way on this counterfeiting laws

268
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,463
Bill needs to get him on Louisiana soil

269
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
So the police can arrest him

270
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
Bill hatches a plan to set up a

271
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,631
Fake company in Livingston Parish that starts doing business

272
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:47,263
Suicune and magic and is fake company orders shipping containers full of counterfeit glue from Hunan Manor

273
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,591
Which will become the evidence they need for an arrest

274
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,175
The relationship going great and at one point and undercover guy at the

275
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
Fake Louisiana

276
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,991
Tells Hunan Magic

277
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
You should come over to Livingston Parish sometime for a visit

278
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,623
Teach us how to grow our business as your distributor

279
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
And they accept the invite

280
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,975
Bill has just two weeks to set up a

281
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
A sting operation

282
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
The plan is to give you and homeway

283
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,863
A tour of the fake company which bill needs to build

284
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,191
From scratch it had to look lived-in had to look real

285
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,239
It had to be so that you dug into it

286
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,567
You would find things I liked that didn't make you suspicious

287
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,383
But they confirm that this was a real living breathe

288
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,247
And that people walked out of it Friday at 5 p.m. and they walked back in

289
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
Monday at 8 a.m.

290
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,831
And there were things going on in the we had to

291
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
Fake storyline

292
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Built into it

293
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
Like what the people

294
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
Do the people in the office were having an affair

295
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,023
And if you if you'd wish group

296
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:47,167
Well if you look through the trash you find crumpled-up little love notes between them

297
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,983
The day of the visit rules around Representatives

298
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
Magic

299
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Show up

300
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
But not

301
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
Un homework

302
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
He's the one a brownie.

303
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
The one they wanted to arrest

304
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
So dummy

305
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
Peanuts farted

306
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
Bill sting operation was a bust

307
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
But then

308
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
Couple months later

309
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
Coonomagic

310
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
Unexpectedly calls of a bro

311
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
And makes acid

312
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
Surprising

313
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Hi res space

314
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
What coonomagic

315
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
Become one of your manufacturers

316
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,655
We are making a bunch of your stuff already anyway

317
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
I was listening to this

318
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Yes and thinking

319
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
Wait a minute

320
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
There is still an arrest warrant out

321
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
4 yuan hongwei in Louisiana

322
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
All we have to do

323
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
Is get him on us soil and he

324
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
He's finished

325
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
We love this idea y'all should come to Indiana

326
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
What's me

327
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,855
Ian Holloway is also not an idiot and said no I don't think so but

328
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
I will be in London in three way

329
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Let's read

330
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
And that is when Bill Mansfield

331
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
Call from abroad

332
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:51,167
Your mission should you choose to accept it is to get you and hongwei arrested in London and then extradited to the US

333
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
Our chance to finally falling over

334
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,031
But it was very soon and it was

335
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
In another country

336
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:02,175
And it was my job to figure it out make it happen or to some extent all this might have been

337
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,527
Bill Spence three Sleepless weeks trying to organize the arrest

338
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
Chinese City

339
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
In London

340
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
Based on a warrant from Louisiana

341
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,231
And by the time he touched down in London at Heathrow Airport

342
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
His plane taxied left instead of right

343
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Came to a stop

344
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
Please came on took him off in car

345
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Jen homeway

346
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
Is behind bars for a while

347
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,263
And then right before his extradition hearing

348
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
He post bail

349
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Annie's release

350
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
What he's told

351
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
You have to remain in

352
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
But instead

353
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
He disappears

354
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:46,463
After the break Abril finally figures out how to shut this whole thing

355
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,863
It does not include catching you and hug way that's just never going to happen

356

Wasn't doing anything

368
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
How to protect a bro

369
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
They had a guy in Beijing working the case

His name is Mark

371
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:28,703
Cohen when the state department created a new position at the embassy to deal with counterfeiting in China

372
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,751
Mark was the one who got the job

373
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
He was the

374
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,311
Perfect person for the gig

375
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
Not only was he an IP lawyer

376
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
He has this

377
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,431
Deep understanding of Chinese culture

378
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
Is Mandarin puts mine to shame

379
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
So

380
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Could you recite

381
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
Say a Tang Dynasty poem for me right now Andre

382
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:55,327
You know that's the most famous part of the problem

383
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
Albert was having with Hunan match

384
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,215
Any words that a bro isn't the only company you at home ways knocking off

385
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Mark Slade

386
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
I want to talk to this guy

387
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
Guy see if I can reason with him

388
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
But you went away

389
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
Is really hard to get in

390
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,431
He's a type of Conifer that we used to call

391
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,015
In Chinese record of Shanghai Mountain stronghold County

392
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
These guys who operate

393
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,135
Been kind of more remote harder to enforce places

394
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,463
Saumur travels down to Hunan Province himself

395
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
To see if he can meet face-to-face with you and homeway

396
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
But before he confronts MP decide

397
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
I better go talk to the local officials first

398
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,679
Sometimes they can be helpful in this matter

399
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
But when you get to their office

400
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,519
He sees something that makes him really nervous

401
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
I saw a

402
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
Window display

403
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,407
With a bunch of awards given to Hunan match

404
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
What were the awards for

405
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,015
Famous brands

406
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
Innovative company

407
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
High-tech company

408
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:55,487
And you could see the way you could see these awards today if you go to the one on Magic website

409
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,535
Under Chinese word says award

410
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,119
They're still bragging about these awful bright and the dates you will notice

411
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
R2000 to mm

412
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
3 mm

413
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,287
When they're counterfeiting products a little typical game you know

414
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,127
Pretend to be the most honorable company in the world to your own

415
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Countryman

416
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Knock off

417
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
Right then and there are two sides

418
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
It's just not worth it

419
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
Because all these Awards

420
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
Local officials

421
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
I probably going to pray

422
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
Protect Hunan

423
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
I decided it was

424
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
It would be unsafe

425
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
For me

426
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
To try to meet with local government officials

427
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,095
Azan physically

428
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
You at home way may have been pressed local

429
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
But they weren't there to protect him in London set in motion a series of events that make out

430
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,335
Counterfeiting

431
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Chest

432
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
Painful and nausea

433
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
Conway

434
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,247
He was threatened with hard labor in Louisiana had to spend

435
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
Weeks in a year

436
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
4 in jail cell

437
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,343
And then had to secretly sleep

438
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
The China

439
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,159
Not the usual cost of doing business

440
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,951
For making knock-off clue

441
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,279
Even though Bill had lost you and homeway in London

442
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
Bill

443
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
Actually one

444
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
Because after London

445
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Jen home

446
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
Stopped

447
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
Counterfeiting eyebrow products

448
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
The bills problems

449
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,287
With a burro counterfeiters

450
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
Didn't quite end there

451
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,383
Reading jinan Magic beating this major counterfeit

452
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
It was similar to how when we beat the Soviet Union

453
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
What do you mean

454
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Well

455
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:26,367
After the Soviet Union fell there was a part of us that said a we won the Cold War

456
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
We don't have any more problems

457
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,463
What we just had were smaller and differ

458
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
Here's what was happening

459
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,815
Even though Hunan magic was out of the picture

460
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:40,191
It's temporary success at ripping off a bro had spawned copycat counterfeiters

461
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Elsewhere

462
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
In

463
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
Gola Ecuador

464
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
And of course other places in China

465
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
What you meant ever had

466
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
A bigger and more complex problem

467
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
You couldn't just hire Bill

468
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
Go around the world planning

469
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,015
Expensive sting operations

470
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
An extradition

471
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,855
What do we do we have to stop the counterfeiters

472
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
But now we've got a bunch of them

473
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,767
And we have to do it in a way that still leaves a business profitable or what's the point right

474
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,071
But when it came to China bill

475
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,631
Remember loves and elaborate sting up

476
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
Operation discovered over time that the solution

477
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
What's an old EX

478
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Complicated

479
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
More expensive

480
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,335
Instead it involve drinking a lot

481
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
Of teeth

482
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,919
It's very good what kind of end

483
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
Government T I'm not real clear

484
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,527
I'm not I don't have I have what's known as a

485
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,343
The gutter palette still has found that in China

486
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,415
Local authorities have a ton of power

487
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,487
So what he does now is set up lots of meetings

488
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,047
Meetings with the people who can launch investigate

489
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
These counterfeit products

490
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
An arrest counterfeit

491
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
I always prefer criminal a

492
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
An arrest is always what I'm looking

493
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
A tot

494
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Sometime in jail

495
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,359
Is never worth selling counterfeit glue

496
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
If you ask Bill

497
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
This is how to stop

498
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
In China and Elsa

499
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
Lots and lots of meetings

500
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
He's been at it 11 years

501
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
He says

502
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,927
He traveled to 55 countries gotten at least a dozen

503
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,743
Convicted and millions of dollars of counterfeit go

504
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Has destroyed

505
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,583
How do you reward these local authorities after a raid.

506
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
To take me out to dinner

507
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:19,007
I wore them with the the key currency all bureaucrats love

508
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
Which is

509
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Thank you

510
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,359
And often a small plaque

511
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
A small Factory can put in their office

512
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:31,551
Is there a Sephora in black and it says you know that you helped us and I like to give him

513
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:36,415
I make sure they know who they help that they see pictures of people that way

514
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,487
Hang up in their office that's really why they're helping you

515
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
The people I'm working with you

516
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,863
The date they want to be people want to be appreciated for their work

517
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,959
You know I thought a lot of the time never bribed

518
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
PPL bill

519
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
No never

520
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,079
We ask Bill about bribery several more times

521
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,871
Anytime he swore

522
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
It never have

523
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,479
But I have to admit you symbol to me

524
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:05,087
The idea that the solution to protecting intellectual property in China is

525
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,159
Justice with local officials

526
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
How typical

527
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
Is eyebrow

528
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,583
We keep hearing stories about how the Chinese don't respect intellectual

529
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
Stories about trade secret theft

530
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,447
Patent infringement forced

531
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
Technology transfers

532
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,311
How can I beat that the solution to all that

533
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,871
Is just a sit-down with a lot of bureaucrats

534
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
Drink a lot of tea

535
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,943
And give out a lot of plaque

536
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,503
I went back and I talked to Mark Cohen about

537
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
And he was like

538
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,831
Publix Sumter

539
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Pictures of what you got

540
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,463
China does protect some for an IP

541
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,023
He pointed me to cases involving vacuum

542
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
Water heater

543
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,631
What he said was important to look at

544
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
Is what China isn't

545
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,703
I believe

546
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
Based on the data.

547
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
NKC

548
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Is that

549
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,127
In general if it's an area that's important to China

550
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
What's a Salmon Canned

551
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
Let's say the it sector

552
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
What's a farmer

553
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,087
That your chances of getting a fair Shake

554
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,391
I'm not nearly as

555
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
As

556
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
Something that is

557
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,975
Of less

558
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,535
Critical importance to China's Industrial

559
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Like

560
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Glue

561
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
Like Glue

562
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:25,983
So you think maybe that's why in the end I wrote found a way to make the system in China work for the company

563
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:32,383
Because they're just selling glue they're not selling semiconductor technology has not as far as I know have a five-year

564
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:38,783
