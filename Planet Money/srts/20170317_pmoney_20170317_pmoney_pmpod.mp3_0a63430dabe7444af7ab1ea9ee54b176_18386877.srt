00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:03,328
Support for NPR and the following message come from State Farm

00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:08,960
When it comes to home and auto insurance they're here through the ups and downs go to statefarm.com

00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:13,824

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,592
State Farm

00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,872
Here to help life

6
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,640
Go right

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,944
There's a hard and fast

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,480
Rule in radio

9
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,248
And maybe

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,272
Noticed this

11
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,296
The rule is

12
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,832
Don't use

13
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
Numbers

14
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,952
Don't use very many numbers because the idea is you're listening to this and actually probably

15
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,720
We doing something

16
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,256
Walking somewhere

17
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,792
Working out doing the dishes

18
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:37,120
It gets confusing if I say 956

19
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,144
6 to 1

20
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,168
Four five

21
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
2

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,472
Because

23
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,008
You have no idea what I

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,568
So that's the rule

25
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,872
Today I'm going to review.

26
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,920
I actually love

27
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
To hear

28
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
Numbers

29
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
On the radio

30
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,760
It's a sort of like

31
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,600
Rhythm poetry thing like I could listen to numbers and I do

32
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
4 hours

33
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,696
In fact sometimes in the morning I will listen to

34
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,232
Bloomberg Business Radio

35
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,256
My family nuts

36
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,560
But I just let the numbers washer

37
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:13,728
Let's check in and how the markets are trading the Dow

38
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:18,592
Is down by 65 points as to be lower by 0.4% the NASDAQ is Trading

39
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,384
Down by one tenth of 1

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,760
10% in the bond markets you're seeing somebody going on and treasuries that you'll come eat at about 3 basis points

41
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,040
2.72

42
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,088
Percent is where the yield is on the 10

43
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,648
And yeah afterwards I do not

44
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,928
Remember any of those

45
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,464
But you know I can

46
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
Feel

47
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,816
The numbers and it makes me feel like someone has measured

48
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,584
Something

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
Calculated sum

50
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
Take a note

51
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,424
Of a particular moment

52
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
Every number

53
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Has a story

54
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:50,080
And so today the show we're going to break the radio rules and just take a Shir

55
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Delight

56
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Numbers

57
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
Three numbers

58
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
In

59
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
3 price tag

60
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Give me the big sad

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
A trillion dollars

62
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
10 million dollars

63
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,488
And $4

64
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
+ 66

65
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,352
The trillion dollars represents the dream for America

66
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,680
10 million dollars is the price of a single punctuation mark

67
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,728
And $4.66

68
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,032
That number involves a magical fairy

69
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,568
If it's in the middle of the night

70
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
Robert Smith

71
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,664
This is fun

72
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,784

00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504
On the show we're going to talk about

81
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
What different things

82
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
Caught starting with

83
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,368
The very small and cheap

84
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,928
To the inconceivably expensive

85
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
So let's just start with

86
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
A handful change

87
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,912
This right here around a dollar in change was what I

88
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
Used to get when I was a child

89
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
For a tooth

90
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
Place underneath my pillow at night

91
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
From the tooth fairy

92
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,128
Now I didn't think much about how much I got just

93
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
I wanted a lot of coins

94
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,712
But now that I'm a father like this has

95
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Actually been added

96
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
Discussion I had played

97
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
Into the Night

98
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
How much should a child get

99
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
For a single tooth

100
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
From

101
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
The tooth fairy

102
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:47,328
And the more you think about the more you realize this is and overlooked economic indicator so

103
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
We brought it reporter Katie Malone

104
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
The palace

105
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
One tooth

106
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
One child

107
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
How much is it worth

108
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
I have an answer

109
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
$4.66

110
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
Cathay pacific boom

111
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,176
66f and we know this how we know this because there is

112
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
Strikingly good data

113
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,344
On what people giving their kids for teeth

114
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
What's call it bigtooth

115
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,184
Every year for just about the last 20 years

116
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
Delta Dental Insurance company has been conducting

117
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
The Tooth Fairy poll

118
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
A nationally representative

119
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Survey

120
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
And currently a tooth is busy

121
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
Pulling in $4.66

122
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
So $4

123
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
$0.66

124
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,335
On average which is then I got as a kid

125
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,223
Did Robert the more I looked into this the more I realized that there is something very strange going on

126
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
With the tooth fairy right now

127
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,367
This sounds a little silly but I can give you an example of just how serious this can get

128
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
Set a scene for you

129
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
It's your mama White House

130
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,487
Members of the economic

131
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Either

132
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,559
In The West Wing sitting around a table

133
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
Brilliant economist

134
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,119
Including Betsey Stevenson

135
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,423
A member of the Council of economic advisers

136
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:00,543
We are sitting around the table waiting for Jack Luther

137
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,383
Treasury secretary to walk over and honestly can't even tell you

138
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,759
What the meeting was about you know what it became about don't we

139
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
She's laughing because what it became about

140
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:18,207
What's a sort of National Economic consensus on what the Tooth Fairy should pay Betsy Stevenson's daughter for

141
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
For a tooth

142
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
I'm guessing first trial

143
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
First kid first tooth

144
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
And I think she had lost it that morning

145
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
It was

146
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
Crisis

147
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
So she turns the room and she says does anyone know

148
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
What the Tooth Fairy is

149
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Paying these days

150
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
It's in the room lights up

151
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
Even people without kids

152
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
Start jumping in with their ideas

153
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
Betsey Stevenson her approaches

154
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,943
What is the tooth fairy give me as a kid

155
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
50 Cent

156
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,783
Gem testing mid-seventies or so

157
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
50 Cent's doesn't buy what it

158
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
You still

159
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
So the question is

160
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,159
Can we adjust that for inflation

161
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
This is a room full of Art

162
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
Nation's top Economist say can do it

163
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
Betsy just figured it out

164
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,839
What is $0.50 from the 70s worth

165
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,703
Now an inflation-adjusted number might put you something closer to $3 a tooth

166
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,055
$3 a tooth that's the inflated number but she asked the other Economist what are your kids act

167
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,847
Truly getting and they say

168
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,663
Poop 5 to $20

169
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,551
Some kid got $20 for a tooth there's General consensus that probably the Tooth Fairy didn't have any change on that

170
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
That does happen

171
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,903
In all seriousness though I mean

172
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
A serious

173
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
The story can get

174
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
I'm looking at that study

175
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
Did you gave me about

176
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
The average 2

177
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
Tooth Fairy gif

178
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
End

179
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,983
It is going up faster than inflation faster than you might think it would end this Robert this is the

180
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,775
Mystery over the last 10 years

181
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
According to that.

182
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
The price of a tooth

183
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Skyrock

184
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
Dental inflation

185
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
What's call it

186
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,759
Has averaged over 10%

187
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
Per year

188
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Which

189
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
Never got anywhere

190
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
Inflation xidan insane number

191
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
And so I

192
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
I figured we needed an expert

193
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
To the bottom of this

194
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:00,607
Yep this is Alan Blinder professor of Economics at Princeton University

195
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,703
The Outlanders not just some Economist in the 1990s he was

196
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,007
Vice chair of the Federal Reserve board

197
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
As you know Robert one of the

198
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Most important jobs

199
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
The FED is to monitor

200
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,639
Inflation and keep it low

201
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
Keep it low and explain to him

202
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
The teeth

203
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,527
Have been going up at this crazy right around 10%

204
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
Premier

205
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,087
Tcsa

206
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
I can't think of anything that's gone up at 10%

207
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:29,535
And 4 comparison he said actual inflation over the last decade must be right around 2%

208
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,863
2% so I mean I get the obvious question is

209
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
What is so special about a tooth

210
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
That makes it go up so Robin

211
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
That was a question that I had and I thought

212
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
Maybe we could find an answer

213
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
In the way we calculate

214
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,639
The 2% number that's inflation for

215
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,431
Everything everything from

216
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
Fuel two bananas to a house

217
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,575
That's what's up kid by they only care about a tiny little section of

218
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
That's okay

219
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
1 Siri I had was

220
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
What if we

221
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Ask kids

222
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
What do you actually care

223
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Care about

224
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,815
And maybe that stuff maybe that stuff has gotten more expensive at a really high rate

225
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Broad Strokes

226
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
Somebody's kids around New York City

227
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
Toys Electronics

228
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:13,055
Candy Nerf gun ice cream rock and roll guitar Pokemon card Max

229
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
Alan Blinder said actually

230
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
A lot of that stuff

231
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,431
Has gotten cheaper over the last decade

232
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,247
Sherpas toys are manufactured overseas

233
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
In China

234
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
Electronics are way more powerful UK

235
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
And anything and

236
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Stop

237
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
By economic logic

238
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
Maybe the Tooth Fairy should actually be bringing less

239
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Pentadecagon

240
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,863
Yeah I think the kids are making out like Bandits here

241
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,447
Do you think an intervention is necessary from your

242
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,007
I will Connecticut government intervention

243
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,847
The mystery deepens like kids are getting more money for more stuff

244
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Then

245
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,735
What explains that $20 bill that I took to do my final economist

246
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,015
Justin wolfers who's

247
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
The professor theme

248
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:00,927
If you want to divorce me, talking into this economist talk about something called the income elasticity of demand

249
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,999
We do want to work Sunday, Target

250
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
The income

251
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Elasticity of demand

252
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,095
Gout

253
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
10%

254
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,167
If all of a sudden you started making

255
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
10% more

256
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
It doesn't mean that you're going to suddenly spend 10% more on

257
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
On every single part of your life

258
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,615
You're not going to spend 10% more necessarily on

259
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
What are the categories of things

260
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
That we might spend

261
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
More than 10%

262
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Now that we have the money

263
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
Wofford suspect

264
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
What's the children

265
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
Are one of those things we like to splurge

266
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:37,023
Into it doesn't surprise me to hear that the Tooth Fairy is outpaced inflation because the two trees one of those Vehicles which which

267
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
We give more to a kids

268
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
One more thing about Justin wolfers

269
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
Remember at the beginning of this we talked about

270
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
White House

271
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Tooth Fairy Summit

272
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
Betsy Stephenson

273
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
Justin wolfers is her partner

274
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
That kid who lost her tooth

275
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
That's just

276
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
Sting's daughter so together they figured it out

277
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:58,271
We're family we taking data the median seems to be a great place to be and that's exactly where

278
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,575
$5

279
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
$5

280
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,439
Feel like my kids have never gotten five.

281
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,743
The rabbit that is the going rate man

282
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
I just can't do it

283
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
Does it make you a bad father

284
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,119
I'm sorry I can't help it I think of it as as

285
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,727
Pocketful of change I think it was changed to but this particular argument always ends up with being

286
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,775
Back in my day

287
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
WhatsApp help

288
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
Three ways to get my tooth fairy

289
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,407
I just feel like you can't talk about this about to sound like a super old

290
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,223
Alright $5 that is $5

291
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:33,599
Kenny Malone one of the correspondents for Planet Money thank you sir thank you

292
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
We think of anything we do you're welcome you're welcome

293
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:46,655
Are the huge leap from pocket change to our next number

294
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,239
10 million dollars that is the voice of Noel King

295
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,799
Who has the story of a very

296
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
Unusual court case

297
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Yes

298
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:00,991
It is a group of dairy truck drivers up in Maine who are suing their bosses for unpaid over

299
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,807
These guys were working long days 12 16 hours

300
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
The bosses were only paying them for 8

301
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Today you are with a bunch of money

302
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
So far during normal case

303
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
Yes this court case hinges on a, that isn't a statute or actually it's a comment that is not

304
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
Gina Statute in Maine state law

305
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,727
The 10 million dollar, Oxford, okay

306
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
Do you know what an Oxford comma

307
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
It's right yes

308
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,359
I'm a firm believer in the extra, if you have a list

309
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
Like you say I like

310
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Dessert

311
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
Soup

312
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
And oranges

313
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
You put a,

314
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,319
After the soup in before the amp

315
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,159
It's that, in a list of items the last, in a list of items but

316
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,999
There's a fierce debate over this some people think the Oxford comma is

317
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
Totally unnecessary

318
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Which brings us back

319
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Viskase in me

320
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,143
I'm going to give you a little

321
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
Primer on what main lost

322
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:57,823
Maine law says everybody gets overtime except for certain people there are there groups that just don't get paid.

323
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
Those people include

324
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
People who work

325
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
Who handle or ship

326
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
Perishable food

327
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Stay don't

328
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
For some reason makeover

329
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,855
What's the statute spells it out really clearly it says the fall

330
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,183
Any worker who is involved in quote

331
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
Canning

332
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:19,327
Processing preserving freezing marketing storing

333
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
Packing for shipment or distribution of

334
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
Perishable foods

335
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
And there are commas

336
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
Between all the work on that list except

337
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,335
Packing for shipment or distribution

338
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
So there's no Oxford, no laugh

339
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
Comma between Shipman

340
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
And Disturbed

341
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
So that

342
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Raise the question

343
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
Does it refer to

344
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
To packing for

345
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
Shipment of distribution

346
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
Or packing for shipment

347
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Or distribution

348
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
That was a very hard thing to say but yet

349
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
That's exactly it

350
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,655
And with the workers lawyer said is

351
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
Because there's no

352
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
Oxford,

353
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
It is

354
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
Packing for shipment or distribution

355
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
Meaning

356
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,127
Distribution at self-driving the milk to stores in

357
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Creating it

358
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
That

359
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
Is not

360
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
An exempt

361
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Professor

362
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
You get overtime

363
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,111
And so did this court case go before an 8th grade

364
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Teacher who decided

365
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,535
Actually everyone kept referencing your 10th grade teachers Wichita

366
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,583
Case went before three different judges

367
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,911
Five different times and here is where it has landed

368
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,495
A judge in the First Circuit Court of Appeals said

369
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
Because there is no Oxford comma

370
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
The wording is too ambiguous

371
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
For him to come down on the side

372
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
Of the company

373
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:44,319
The judge is essentially saying if the state wanted to make it clear that distribution is one of the things for which you don't

374
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Makeover time

375
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,415
The probably should have put an Oxford comma in that list

376
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,487
So for want of a, the

377
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Court case

378
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
This was what

379
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,119
The court case actually has not been one just yet what the judge said is that it

380
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
Thank you.

381
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,751
We are now going to ratchet this up 5

382
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
Five decimal places up to a trillion dollars at The Brick support and the following

383
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
Message come from ishares because the best preparation for tomorrow is building for your future

384
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:22,207
Today ishares by BlackRock inspired to build

385
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
Our final number today

386
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
Is 1

387
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
Trillian

388
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
Dollar

389
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,935
I kinda wanna do a Dr Evil One million

390
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Dollars

391
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,287
That laughter comes from Elsa

392
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,359
Check who until very recently was NPR

393
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:45,759
Senate correspondent now a new member of Planet Money welcome and one trillion dollars is

394
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:52,159
In the news right now because because President Trump has said that he wants to spend a trillion dollars

395
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
Where's to build infrastructure

396
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
All across the United States

397
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
You probably picked this number because it sounds amazing

398
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
Between dogs but we had the question

399
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,447
If not a lot of money when it comes to infrastructure

400
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
Seems like a lot of mud

401
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
But there's a lot of different ways to look at this

402
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,615
It is a lot of money if you think about what we're already spending on it for

403
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
Struxureware spending

404
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
Two and a half trillion over the knee

405
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
10 years

406
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,783
Switch William on top of that more is a 40% jump

407
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
Which I put up there with the sort of

408
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Historic level

409
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
Of of spending infrastructure

410
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,695
Country singer

411
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
President Eisenhower

412
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
Power spent roughly that scale

413
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Of money

414
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
We started the interstate highways

415
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
And if you wanted to

416
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
Rebuild the entire interstate highways

417
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
Today you actually take

418
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Paw Patrol

419
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
How to transfer

420
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Infrastructure budget

421
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,103
But they did not say he wanted to spend a trillion dollars

422
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
On Road

423
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
He said he wanted to

424
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,527
Do everything everywhere we will rebuild our road

425
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
Al Bridge

426
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
Star tunnel

427
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
Highways airports

428
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
School

429
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
Hosp

430
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
You get a sewer system

431
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
You get a highway

432
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,071
You know what you want new elevators in your Municipal Building you got it

433
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,607
Exactly

434
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:09,471
You start to think Will trump want to do everything everywhere

435
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,519
How far does a trillion dollars

436
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Actually

437
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
What is an actually bio

438
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Yuan realtor

439
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,151
And that's what I said to find out

440
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
Just bobbing around New York

441
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
Yeah obviously the most expensive

442
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
Absolutely

443
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
But

444
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,855
The money doesn't go very far

445
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,791
Alright I'm Ready the Second Avenue subway right now okay so this is the new subway line on the east side of Manhattan

446
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,375
It cost 4 and 1/2 billion dollars just add three subway stop

447
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,215
I just rode the subway one

448
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,799
Stop which means I just burned through a billion and a half dollars

449
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
It took about

450
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
73 seconds

451
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,919
Or go down to the newly-built

452
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
Down by the world

453
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,735
Kobe

454
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Oculus

455
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,295
It is a gorgeous

456
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Gorgeous

457
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
I'm standing in basically a giant

458
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,951
Hallway right now it's like the lobby for a train station

459
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
4 billion dollars

460
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,327
It is basically just the entrance to a train

461
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Right

462
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,679
You look at a list of plan projects for New York

463
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
Weekly this money can

464
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Depleted

465
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,847
Another 10 billion would be needed to rebuild a Port Authority Bus

466
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,687
Turn on another 20 billion would be needed to build a Amtrak train

467
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
Tunnel under the Hudson River

468
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:28,063
If you want more community centers you want to rebuild housing hospitals water mains and sewers

469
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,391
All that money quickly as up you can get it 100 billion in a blanket

470
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
And that's just one city in the entire country

471
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,999
Yeah the biggest city but just one city

472
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
And I should say this when Donald Trump says

473
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
One trillion dollars

474
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
You need to keep in mind to caveat

475
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
First of all were talking about a trillion dollars

476
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
10 years

477
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
So that's a hundred billion

478
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
Per year for the entire

479
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Country

480
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,383
Most of his money

481
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,943
The ideas is going to come from

482
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
Private investor

483
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,063
Yeah this was the fine print on the infrastructure plan which was the government was going to offer

484
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Tax break

485
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,903
Or Private Industry to build a lot of

486
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:10,559
And a concerned about that is that maybe private investors be incentivized to invest in projects that would provide

487
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
Big revenue streams

488
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,447
Big shiny things they can brag about or things like toll roads I can make money

489
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
Exactly instead of say

490
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
Building sewer size

491
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,823
Dunellen wants to a ribbon-cutting in a sewer
