1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,792
Hey it's

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Sally Helm here

3
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:06,656
The Republicans are about to take control in Washington

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:12,544
And this week we are replaying an episode about what happened when a republican Governor cut

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,568
Taxes in

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:19,968
The show originally ran in October of 2014 and will have an update for you at the end

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,272
For now here is Robert Smith

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,040
And Zoe

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,392
This is the story of a politician who took a chance

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,440
And is now fighting for his political

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,744
The man is Sam Brownback

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,536
He's a republican governor of Kansas

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:37,120
Let me start off by saying that I am bullish

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,144
On Kansas

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,728
This guy expected to be re-elected

16
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,288
Sam Brownback won by a landslide

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,056
4 years

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,872
And when he was elected the Senate six years before that

19
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,640
Awesome Lance

20
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:52,224
And 6 years before that everyone loves Sam Brownback

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,552
But things are really upside down in Kansas right now

22
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,856
In fact last week I was in a library

23
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,880
In Topeka KS

24
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:03,232
Kansas and I'm talking to this former budget director for the state of Kansas

25
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,512
And he says

26
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,816
You will not believe what is happening next

27
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,864
Next door

28
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:13,216
About 500 Republicans are going to endorse

29
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,008
The Democratic ticket for governor

30
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,056
In about an hour

31
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,872
It seems weird is that weird

32
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,944
Oh yeah that's really unusual for Kansas

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
Yeah

34
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,552
I go take a look and there all these white haired guys in suits

35
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
Thank you all for being here Republicans are

36
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
Former politicians guys who presumably voted for Sam Brownback they're lined up at a small pool

37
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
To endorse

38
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
Paul Davis

39
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,936
Who is the Democratic

40
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,544
We're here today point out the worsening results

41
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,128
Sam brownback's failed experiment on Kansas

42
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
This whole story comes down

43
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,712
To this big

44
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Experiment

45
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
And economics.

46
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Brownback

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,136
Tried something that should have landed him in the Republican Hall of Fame

48
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
If that exists

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,768
Something that I would have thought would have cemented his support

50
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,096
As very Republican governor in a very Republic

51
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,960
Sam Brownback is close to losing his bid for re-election

52
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,520
Because Sam Brownback cut

53
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Taxes

54
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,760
Cheese today Republican Governor lives the dream

55
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,856
Because taxes dramatically in his state where state in transition

56
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
From a high tax state

57
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
Tupelo tax date

58
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,280
He promises Good Times ahead and the good times do not

59
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,608
And people even the Republicans get really mad

60
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:51,520

Sogo

70
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
I went to Kansas

71
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
And I drove all over

72
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
And everyone was either talking about

73
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016

Deep economic questions

76
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,136
Basically about Brown Bags

77
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
The experiment

78
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
Here's how the whole thing.

79
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
Raquan Brown Bag guidance office a few years ago

80
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,096
He decided to do this pretty flashy

81
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
Indus fiscally conservative

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
Barry non-flashy

83
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,592
We'll have a real live experiment we're right next to some other states that haven't lowered taxes by

84
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
We'll see how it works

85
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
Republicans

86
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
Love to talk about lowering taxes

87
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,528
Brown Bag decided he was going to be the guy who would go

88
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Big

89
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
The question was

90
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,416
What would happen if Kansas had the lowest taxes in the Midwest

91
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
His big idea was that

92
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,256
People and businesses would be like yes

93
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
I am going to go to

94
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,095
To Kansas that is where I'm going to do business now

95
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
The business is already in Kansas

96
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
They would use the money to expand

97
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,799
So you really get your acceleration this like shooting adrenaline Into the Heart

98
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
I'm growing the economy

99
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
I taken at tax office

100
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,663
A small business were most your job creation

101
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,247
Brownback went back and forth with the legislature

102
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,903
And in the end the bill that they came up with was the tax cut plan that was way bigger than what they thought

103
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
Was even possible in the

104
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
Taxes on small businesses would go to

105
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
0

106
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,071
So they stopped paying anything

107
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:57,471
And personal income taxes went down by a lot also like the highest income bracket went down by

108
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
25

109
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
8% about

110
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
We've the big question which is

111
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,383
After this big tax cut

112
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
Where is Kansas going to get all the money that it needs to

113
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
To run the state

114
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,319
To pay for education and Healthcare in the stuff that comes out of the state

115
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
Budget this was the Crux of the

116
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,391
Experiment

117
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:20,255
There is this Venus theory behind this idea and conservative circles

118
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,119
That tax cut is done correctly will eventually bring more money into a CD

119
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,471
Mysterious pushed by this one Economist that you may have heard of

120
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
He works for Ronald

121
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,407
Reagan talk to me dr. Laffer yes can you hear me I am enjoying the conversation with you it's very much fun

122
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
Arthur Laffer

123
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
And Brownback wanted the regen guys help

124
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
He called me

125
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,903
Around the time he was proposing his tax and tax changes in Kansas

126
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,231
And asked me to come down and spend some time with him and talk

127
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:56,607
With the legislature Arthur Laffer is famous for something and economically called the Laffer

128
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
And it is really more of

129
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
Thought experiment then like

130
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
A mathematics

131
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
Formula

132
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
And I want to spend a minute or so

133
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Here really

134
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:11,711
Explaining it because it is actually the theoretical underpinning of what Brownback did

135
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,271
Which is fascinating and weird in an oven

136
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
Robert come back for second in

137
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Let's watch

138
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Okay so

139
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
It is really all about tax

140
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
In which tax rate brings in the most

141
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
Let's start

142
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Play Swift

143
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
A 100% tax rate

144
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,239
Basically the government takes every dime

145
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
You make

146
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
You work all day long

147
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
And you get nothing the government

148
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
Takes everything out of your paycheck

149
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
Obviously no one would work

150
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,991
With that kill everyone who quit their job so

151
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,063
In this imaginary places 1% tax rate

152
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
The government would get

153
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
No rap

154
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Nobody

155
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,487
Okay so the government's like we're getting $0 at 100%

156
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
What if we lowered

157
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
To 90% rate

158
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,143
Which is still an incredibly High rate but

159
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,471
Some people would go back to work to get that money

160
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
Just for that 10% of your income

161
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
It would give the rest of the 90%

162
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
To the government

163
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,943
So this is laffer's big inside the Laffer Curve which

164
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
The way The Story Goes

165
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
He drew on a napkin

166
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Somewhere in

167
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
Everything is laid out of

168
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Always on an app

169
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,719
This napkin showed or so he said that the government can lower taxes

170
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
And

171
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
Get more Revenue

172
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:34,655
Is because going from 100 to 90 would yields more Revenue that doesn't mean it is always

173
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
True

174
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,239
Government might find if they lowered the rate from say

175
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:44,639
40% to 30% did actually just get less Revenue because it wouldn't necessarily incentivize

176
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
Why so many

177
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
People to go back to work

178
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
Revenue with just drop

179
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527
This is what the Brownback experiment

180
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
What happened

181
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
At lower tax rate

182
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,183
Specifically what happens if you lower the tax rate for small businesses

183
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
From an already low percentage in Kansas

184
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
2-0

185
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
Will Kansas

186
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,631
Skip more businesses suddenly will those businesses create more jobs

187
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,935
Will eventually there be more people working and work

188
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,263
People paying other kinds of taxes that weren't lowered like sales tax

189
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
In other words

190
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
On the Laffer Curve

191
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
Will the government of Kansas make

192
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
More money by cutting

193
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
That is the bet that brown bag

194
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
It's making

195
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
And that is what I asked

196
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Laugh about

197
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:29,183
Do you say I'm going to run one of the greatest experiments on the Laffer Curve that state tax policy has ever seen

198
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,743
I don't know if he actually said that or not

199
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
But he sure as heck has done that

200
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
Arthur Laffer says he

201
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
He did not design the tax cut plan himself but

202
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
You did a great job

203
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Laughter is

204
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,007
Certain he is for sure

205
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,823
The underground bags experiment Kansas will

206
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,895
Wellmore employment more output more production

207
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,199
More sales taxes because these people have

208
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,015
Higher incomes they moved from Missouri to Kansas

209
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
Care more jobs

210
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,599
Creative in Kansas they'll be more payroll taxes

211
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
Into Republicans in Kansas that sounded

212
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Great

213
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,023
Les Donovan was Republican state senator at the time

214
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
I'm he remembers it

215
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
He helped push this plan through

216
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,655
Do cut the tax out on

217
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,959
Do certain types of income business income

218
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,519
It's an incentive for people to

219
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,311
Are more people

220
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,919
Not pay the taxes to the state of Kansas but they're going to hire people

221
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
Give them jobs and they're going to pay taxes to

222
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
That's the way they're supposed to work

223
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,831
This is officially known as supply-side

224
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Economics

225
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Although

226
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
People who are not

227
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,439
Favorite often called trickle down economics

228
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
Whatever the name

229
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
Kansas was all in

230
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
The law was passed

231
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Experiment was underway

232
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:44,447
I'm going to zero is a really big change I wanted to see what it was like for these

233
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,751
Much vaunted small businesses

234
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,103
So everywhere I went in Kansas I would go into places and ask them about it

235
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
Take the sky Alex

236
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,223
Harp Kansas small business person of the year

237
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
He's just starting up his second business in Wichita

238
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Restaurants

239
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,903
It's a it's set beef and chicken shawarmas Falafel sandwiches how much

240
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,719
Salads we have the Mediterranean salad fattoush salad

241
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:13,119
You know enough reserve it there's no fat and that it's healthy and discretion is delicious and inexpensive

242
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
And it's fast

243
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,775
Alex Harvey move to Wichita from Lebanon 14 years ago

244
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,591
He already runs a computer retail and service shop

245
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,407
A Golden Corral franchise in Missouri

246
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
And now he runs

247
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Meddys

248
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,271
Isn't the first of his many plants warmest spots

249
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,623
You made me order all the Shawarma that were available beef chicken and falafel

250
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
Hey Jason

251
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
Where is JC

252
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,559
He said he didn't even know he was going to get this Big Tex

253
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:47,423
You know I honestly didn't really believe it so I called my accountant his name is David Guevara

254
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
He's an awesome guy

255
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,775
He said yeah you not going to have any taxes pay any taxes

256
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
You know

257
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,871
Next year so great

258
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Awesome

259
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,479
Alex's first move with exactly what brown bag head

260
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
I dreamed that it would be

261
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Alex

262
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
Took his tax cut money

263
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
And he invested into his business

264
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
His computer business

265
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Ribbit

266
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,511
We added more iPads into a RM in 30 without money

267
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
Got a bunch of iPads

268
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,911
We didn't really focus on selling iPads at Ribbit Computers

269
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
So

270
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
You know

271
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
We have more iPhone

272
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,055
So this is the first step in the Brown Bag experiment

273
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
The reinvestment

274
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
Across town the same thing happen

275
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,503
Gary Mason is the CEO of this company is I Environmental

276
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
Bee clean up things like

277
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,855
Graffiti he says or toxic

278
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,903
Weast and he knew that

279
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
Tax-cut was coming and he knew what he was supposed to do with it would free up some more money to allows to go buy more quick

280
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,143
Which in turn if we leverage that can hire more people

281
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
So kind of snowballs on itself

282
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
Gary Mason bought

283
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
Power washer

284
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
Very powerful power washer

285
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
$80,000

286
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
Cut through concrete

287
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
It's very very high pressure

288
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
Matter fact we got contacted by

289
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,807
A party yesterday to go

290
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Cut something off a bridge tomorrow

291
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,951
This was all working theoretically as it should

292
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:19,327
Businesses are reinvesting and with that investment they will do more business

293
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
And then also theoretically higher

294
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,191
Mason says he's going to hire

295
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,751
Theoretically that new guy could go down

296
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,847
To Alex's store and buy an iPad with his new fancy salary

297
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
That generates

298
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,199
New revenue for the state that they wouldn't have gotten otherwise

299
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,991
And that is what

300
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Economic growth

301
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
Increase spending increase

302
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
Hiring

303
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
And it's not really happening

304
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,951
At least at the Shawarma level of the economy

305
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
Did you hire anybody

306
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
Melanie

307
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:55,167
Not really because you hide People based on that based on how much money you have based on your business it didn't really have in Media

308
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,239
Help on the business I didn't really notice any

309
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,823
More business purchasing you know around here so

310
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Literally

311
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,919
Drinking anything for hire more employees

312
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:12,063
Yeah Alex is not the only one to notice that business hasn't really picked up yet in

313
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,647
After the tax cuts Revenue to the state budget

314
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
Starting to drop

315
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
Very dramatic

316
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:23,583
It's obvious when you think about it that if you give someone $100 tax cut

317
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
And they spend that money

318
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
The state only gets

319
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
$6 and fifty

320
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
Keen sense back

321
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Incel

322
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,359
The seat budget office they knew there would be a short fault that they started wouldn't be that bad

323
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,455
The projected revenues would fall by 300 million dollars

324
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,039
In fact State revenues fell by twice that in the

325
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:49,439
First year after the tax cut the seat was bringing in six hundred million dollars less than they had before

326
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Which is a Big Dipper

327
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,839
To balance the budget Kansas spent down its reserves and tax into the highway budget

328
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,399
The experiment was not really going

329
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
According to

330
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:04,031
Playing at least as the plant have been laid out it was not the shot of adrenaline to the Kansas

331
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,335
Economy that the governor have been talking about

332
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:11,711
And some people in Kansas started to really worry about the future of the Kansas budget

333
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
Especially people

334
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Korean School

335
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,135
We've watched us as Educators were watching The Strain run into the wall and

336
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
We're all sitting here watching it

337
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,743
Lake lots of other school superintendent

338
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,327
Glenn suitcase decided to Make Some Cuts in his district

339
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,143
And there was one really obvious thing

340
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
The whole school

341
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,799
This one school in the Tiny Town of Marquette right in the middle of Kansas

342
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,151
Last February all the schools parents met in the gym and watch the

343
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
School Board

344
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Vote on this car

345
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
There was silence

346
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Before

347
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
The motion

348
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
No one wanted to give the motion

349
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
They knew what they needed to do

350
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
They thought about it many times

351
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
For that night

352
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
That was

353
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
The worst moment

354
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,215
I believe there was another long period of

355
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,751
Uncomfortable time when

356
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
Before the 2nd

357
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
The motion

358
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
And as that happened in the boarding

359
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
The building was

360
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Officially closed

361
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
That night

362
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
I went out to Market

363
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
See the town without his

364
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
I'm in the middle of nowhere there's

365
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Grain elevator

366
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
Main Street

367
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
Restaurant

368
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
A bar

369
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,023
The very nice

370
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,327
Very empty school building

371
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,191
If you look through the window you can still see some of the instruments the band used inside

372
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,519
Xylophone in the timpani or just alone in a dark room

373
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
It's little bit creepy

374
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,127
Driving around the town it does seem like a really

375
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,967
Turned out the school had only 65 kids in it

376
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,039
Now those kids split up at a bus stop every morning

377
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,855
Take some 10 to 20 miles out of town to go to school

378
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,903
In the Tiny Town like this

379
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,999
65 people leaving it everyday is a big deal

380
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,839
I found that out of the grocery store Steve Piper is the owner

381
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,655
She was cooking pulled pork on the smoker outside

382
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,823
That looks so good I have been around

383
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,383
Decimus pork ribs too early

384
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,711
Steve's around bald guy wearing an apron

385
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,783
This is the kind of guy that was supposed to benefit from the Brownback tax

386
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
But the one school in town closing

387
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
That was a way bigger deal

388
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,743
For a business owner you better off having those teachers and those jobs here in Marquette

389
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
That they then shoppingtown help you out that way

390
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Versus

391
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Having a

392
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,167
Neon floor tax if you're not making me money service

393
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,471
Taxes mean nothing if your sales are down

394
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
Texas me nothing

395
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,567
Do yourself a percentage of a smaller amount right

396
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
Right

397
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
If you lose someone like this

398
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
You might lose the election

399
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,479
This is the guy that Brownback was eating at

400
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,551
Tax cut small business expansion

401
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,951
Not small town shriveling up and dying and businesses closing up I want to sell my stores are going to be worth anything

402
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,815
Has anyone going to want to move to Marquette and buy a Small Town Square without a school until

403
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,447
This has been a problem in rural Kansas for a long time the 1 School in town closing

404
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,751
Marquette is surrounded by Ghost Town

405
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,079
Places that wash their schools and then the town went away

406
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
This school probably would have closed it some

407
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:26,015
But because of the big experiment everyone in town is pointing to Brownback

408
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Weaning

409
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
There is a sense they can

410
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,391
Is actually falling behind

411
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Economically

412
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,719
And the statistics so far bear this out

413
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,535
After the tax cut there was not

414
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,863
A flood of new residents and businesses into cans

415
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,215
Other states that border Kansas are actually growing faster

416
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
Creating more jobs

417
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,287
Even with their higher tax

418
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,359
Sam Brownback is an interesting Stitch

419
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,711
He did what he believed in he has not backed away from his theory

420
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
He says look we are

421
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Poised

422
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
To grow and

423
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
We have created

424
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:05,183
55000 private-sector jobs in Kansas is getting jobs

425
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
Just

426
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,511
More slowly than people maybe

427
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
He thought that it would

428
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,351
Brownback says if he is re-elected he is going to

429
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,447
Stick with this plan he's going to keep cutting income taxes all the way down to

430
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,799
I asked Arthur Laffer the famous economist behind the experiment

431
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
What he makes of this stuff

432
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,383
Situation for Governor Brownback

433
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,199
Isn't the point of the policy to

434
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,015
Create more revenue and more growth

435
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,831
Yes but it's not in the first hour

436
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,671
I'm sorry it takes people a long time to adjust to a new tax code

437
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,255
It takes a long time and that's why I do all of my work over a decade

438
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
And look at what the results are

439
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,119
Over long periods of time which is what a governor should do

440
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
When he governs

441
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
So she governs a steak

442
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,751
And to expect that to occur in the first year is is is not

443
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,311
Of course new governor is elected for

444
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,151
For 10 years experiments in politics they have four years to work

445
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
For years and there's a verdict

446
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
Sam brownback's

447
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,015
Verdict has arrived

448
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
Election day is in two weeks

449
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
And right now the reason

450
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,623
Is 2 closed

451
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Call

452
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
Hey it's Allie

453
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,047
That race was in November of 2014 and

454
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
Sam Brownback

455
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
What

456
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,911
He won by a really small margin he got 49

457
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,959
Percent of the vote and the Democrat he was running against

458
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Got 40

459
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
Percent of the vote

460
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
But that was enough

461
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
He had four more years.

462
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
Keep going with it

463
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
I called up Sam's f

464
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,991
He's a reporter at kcur in Kansas City he covers politics

465
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
And educate

466
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,319
I asked him how things are going now

467
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
And he said not well

468
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,415
It's dire it's serious

469
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
People are worried

470
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:46,047
Because the seat is right now facing a billion dollar deficit

471
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,351
Over the next two fiscal years

472
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:52,191
And they've been searching couch cushions all over the state

473
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,007
Trying to find any nickels and dimes a can

474
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
To balance the state budget

475
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,871
There has been job growth in Kansas he said

476
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
But it's been slower than in neighboring state

477
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
And

478
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
Sam Brownback

479
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
Sam Brownback is the least

480
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Popular governor in a mirror

481
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,599
Brownback gave his

482
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
State of the State

483
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
Address on January

484
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,719
10th and he said he is sticking with his plan to

485
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
To cut taxes

486
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
But it seems like at least

487
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,839
Some people in Kansas are getting a little sick

488
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
That plan

489
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:24,703
At the elections in November a lot of Brownback allies in the latest

490
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Play Charlie lost

491
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,895
The legislative session began on Monday and the state legislature has already introduced a bill to end some of the brown

492
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,991
The governor has two more years to see if it's

493
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
The plan will work

494
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,367
His term ends in 2018

495
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,791
Do you know of some other plan that might have had an unintended consequences

496
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,863
Maybe something your job something that happened in your town

497
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
We want to hear about it

Today's update was produced by me I'm Sally home

Thanks for listening
