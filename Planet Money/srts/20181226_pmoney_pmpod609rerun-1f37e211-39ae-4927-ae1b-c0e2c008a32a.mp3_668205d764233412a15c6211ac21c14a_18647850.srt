It's one of the fastest-growing games in the country

118

Magic is played with elaborately Illustrated cards

119
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
A complicated set of rules

120
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,871
The I assume that this whole fat

121
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Completely

122
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
Because I hadn't heard anything

123
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,807
But then one of my producers here in the office said to me

124
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
This game is

125
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
Alive and Kicking

126
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903

And we can play

133
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,631
Cebu explain to me that

134
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,191
Basically these cards are like baseball cards

135
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
I like myself

136
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
And they have these creatures on them

MBA School statistics Reddit powerful

138
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,383
They are but unlike baseball cards you can actually

139
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Do something

140
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,431
You can actually play a game

141
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,527
Yeah it's kind of actually really funny you're like you're like a wizard

142
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,087
And each one of these cards is a spell

143
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
In your deck

144
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,927
And the trick to this game is so you have to assemble enough spells

145
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,999
In the right combination so that you can beat your opponent

146
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
It's

147
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,863
Is supremely nerdy and I mean that in the best possible way

148
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,679
It was designed by math graduate students

149
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
For people who eventually might

150
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
B math graduate students

151
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
We tried that one of the early employees

Of magic

153
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
A math and physics grad student named skaff Elias

154
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,991
And he says from the beginning they suspected that these cards

155
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
Would be added

156
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
Every game you played was different

157
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,463
You know you immediately thought about wow if I could change my deck if I could take this out or I can put that in it would play a different way

158
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
Tennis game

159
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
It would come back to bite them

160
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
And this is the economic

161
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
They sold the cards in

162
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
You pay like $3 for a pack

163
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
I could get a bunch of random

164
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
Cart

165
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,079
But occasionally there would be a rare and Powerful something in the

166
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
Dragon angel

167
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
It was like a little Lottery

168
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
So that anticipation of did I get the best

169
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
One of those hundred we are cards

170
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
Is yeah that's a super exciting for

171
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855
Steps right

172
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,671
Yo you go to the store you buy pack if your pack after pack

173
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,207
Looking for that rare card

174
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,511
And they expected this when they started

175
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,119
But what they didn't plan for was that once people got those rare cards

176
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
They would start to resell

177
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
For a lot of my

178
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
The rare dragons

179
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
Creatures and even rare flowers

180
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
Start to go for more and more money

181
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
Some of these cards that

182
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,479
Anomaly are $3 a piece cuz they're the one rare card that comes in a $3 pack

183
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
Eventually those become

184
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
$10 cards

185
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:24,927
And $15 cards and then hundred dollar cards and then $500 cards this all happened in the first year

186
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
This should start to sound familiar this is a stage

187
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
YouTube

188
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
Business perspective

189
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
It was a gold mine

190
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
Sign companies owned the magic card

191
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Come pick up Wizards of the Coast

192
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
Was literally selling

193
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
Pieces of paper

194
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
Did some people thought

195
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
Where were the fortune

196
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
Speculators would buy cards by the

197
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
Hunt trying to find

198
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Bsquare car

199
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
People at

200
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
The company a lot of them wanted to push that side of it

201
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
Produce more cars produced rare cards keep the print runs Limited

202
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
For many people the symbol of this craze

203
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
What's something called

204
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
The Blacklist

205
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
The black lotus

206
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
The black lotus

207
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
It wasn't a monster it's not a dragon

208
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
It's just a flower

209
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
But I gave you the special ability it let you have

210
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
Extra power sooner than anyone else

211
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
Which meant that if you had enough of

212
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
You could beat your opponent

213
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Really fast

214
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
And

215
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
This card ended up being worth what

216
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
It was worth

217
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Thousands of dollars

218
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
And show you how exciting

219
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
This card was

220
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,831
We're going to play a YouTube video going around of a man

221
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
Who is opening up a pack of

222
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Random Magic

223
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
Flipping through them

224
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
Andy fine

225
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
A black lotus

226
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
And then the other one is

227
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
Cooley

228
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
Oh my gosh

229
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Precisely

230
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,895
Baidu

231
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,199
Holy mackerel it's right there

232
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,271
Magic was well on its way to being the next Beanie Baby

233
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
What's gap and fellow designers

234
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
Saw a big problem

235
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,415
Because remember magic isn't just a collect

236
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,719
Nothing like a beanie baby you put on your shelf

237
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,511
It's also supposed to get game

238
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:10,143
It was me a fun game you play with your friends cheap fun game but all the sudden they were these where powerful

239
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Shuffle cards

240
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,215
That you could buy if you had enough money

241
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
It would allow you to beat

242
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Your friends

243
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,615
You know at first it doesn't sound so bad right

244
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,663
But imagine you're playing a high-stakes poker game

245
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,223
And you could go to the store and buy just

246
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
10 Aces

247
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
Nobody would play poker

248
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
Nobody would play that

249
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
This is what the magic folks

250
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
We're worried about

251
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:36,511
Sky Phantom the other math guys looked around and said you know this bubble is going to pop hard

252
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
This is going to be

253
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,071
Like Cabbage Patch Kid

254
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,887
Star Wars figurine for pods

255
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,215
Being a math guy and working with other math guy

256
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,263
They actually went out and grass

257
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,615
The life cycle of a fat that use Research into comic books and baseball cards

258
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
To figure out

259
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919
How much time am I

260
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,319
The stuff we looked at had its its height like where it was sort of white-hot would be around a two-year

261
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,671
At some point you realize why I just spent $1,000 and there's only

262
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,487
$25 worth of comics here that I actually want to read

263
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,655
And that that that hit you like a ton of bricks and as soon as enough people believe that the momentum in the mark

264
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Changes

265
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
And and then there's a big problem

266
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,543
Stop at his friends made an argument that

267
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,615
Sure you could make a lot of cash

268
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,455
In two years you can burn this whole thing out and walk away with millions of dollars

269
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
But he said perhaps

270
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
We should see if we can make

271
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Magic City

272
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Stainable

273
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,111
If we can make less money in the short-term

274
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
I keep it going for 5 years

275
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Tenure

276
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Perhaps he said we can

277
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
Wait this bubble

278
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Without popping

279
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,559
So the first thing they had to do was bring back

280
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
The price of magic cards

281
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
2 normal level so that an average person

282
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Could buy them again

283
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
Set a fire.

284
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Compresses and

285
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
Basically princes sleuth new car

286
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,151
We just printed so many cards of the new sets coming out we warned people that were going to do that

287
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,039
What that meant immediately from the get-go was even though people could still make money in the secondary Market of the older cards

288
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
The speculators would no longer touch

289
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
A new set of cards

290
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
We had a pretty neat trick

291
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
To doing this they would basically print a bunch of cards

292
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
Then it would go out to the car shops

293
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
To see what the facts were selling for

294
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
And if they were selling for more than retail price

295
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
They would print some more

296
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
And some more and some more and eventually

297
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,263
Even the most stubborn speculators gave out

298
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
They were able to

299
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
The push the price of each pack

300
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,871
Down to what they really wanted to sell them at

301
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
About 3 bucks

302
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
The collectors were not play

303
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,015
We heard from so many people that we were

304
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Throwing the game

305
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
And then 95

306
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Over and over

307
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
Like it's this is the end

308
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
You guys

309
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,975
Have screwed everything up with much more colorful language

310
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
And they had just

311
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
Start it

312
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,583
Because they had a second problem all those old cars

313
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
Remember the black lotus

314
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Black lotus

315
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
Rare dragon

316
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
They were so powerful that you couldn't

317
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,775
Just print a lot of those because that would

318
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Still ruins

319
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,103
And they're worried about pissing off fans

320
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Even more than they already work

321
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
You imagine

322
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
Kid who saved his allowance

323
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
It's for a year

324
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
Just to get a rare card

325
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,575
Didn't want to say like hahaha it's worth nothing

326
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
So we came up with another solution

327
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,975
They tried the band The Cars from play and that didn't work that didn't work at all because

328
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
Players want to play the way they learn how to

329
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
We came up with a really interesting fact

330
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Patriot

331
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Pro league

332
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Professional magic cards

333
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Yeah

334
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,567
The crowd is mug

335
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
Oh my God

336
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
And the police had an advantage

337
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
Work the company

338
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Magic because

339
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,135
Magic could set the rules for the

340
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,207
Yeah that's right so they set a rule that said

341
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
You can only play with the most

342
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Instead of card

343
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
No black lotuses

344
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
No super powerful monster car

345
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Just the last

346
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,471
And so by setting those rules they basically say two players everywhere

347
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
Sure you could use the old cards

348
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
But if you want to

349
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
Do what the pros do

350
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
You should only use the new car

351
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
That's right

352
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
And the plan

353
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Wart

354
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,967
Remember Zach Hill

355
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,039
5th grader who made $10,000 on Beanie Babies

356
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
You got into magic cards

357
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,135
As a fat but he got good at them

358
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
And he grew up to be a big name professional

359
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,255
Magic card player and eventually got offered a job at

360
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,559
Company to design magic cards and says

361
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
By the time he had gotten there

362
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
They had solved

363
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,191
All of those early problems they were not making

364
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
The same missed

365
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,519
We can't just keep printing

366
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,079
More and more and more and more powerful

367
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
Are more and more and more and more big and splashy

368
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Ecards

369
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
That's why we don't make like

370
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,527
Our market research shows that people like

371
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
Swords Angels fire dragons wings and battles on cards right so we don't make

372
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Take the like

373
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
Batwing Angel sword

374
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
Fiery Doom

375
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,607
I can see your eyes though you did that would be a pretty good card

376
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,679
I like it I'm not going to lie to you

377
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,263
Simply figured out how to keep the economy of the game stable

378
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
And talk to people involved in the game it's amazing

379
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,151
How much they talk as if they are sort of a central bank

380
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
Running economy they want

381
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
Stable prices

382
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
They want the game to grow

383
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,087
But they don't want to go too fast and I don't want to grow too slow there's this

384
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Target

385
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
For growth

386
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
They managed to make a game

387
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
What is it now

388
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,511
22 years later

389
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
22 years

390
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,839
Bowie hits. Going to play this weekend in the fact

391
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,143
He dragged me down to a card store

392
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
The other night

393
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Friday night

394
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
At midnight

395
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
What people were lined up

396
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
To get the latest data

397
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
Signed up

398
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,871
And paid for in a

399
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Dance

400
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,247
Do the back of the line and we will take care of you at the end

401
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
All right who's excited

402
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,367
Gatherer fate reforged

403
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
And I had no

404
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
Idea

405
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
This exists

406
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,255
First of all that there was a store like this called

407
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
Twenty-sided store after

408
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
The dice

409
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:03,167
But the people were basically going to play this new set of cards

410
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
All night long

411
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
They're at least 50

412
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:12,383
They're all lined up to play this new deck of cards before anybody else and they were packed in there like

413
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
Ripping up in these packs

414
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
Like slapping other cards

415
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,783
Shuffling them and you can see how the company sort of

416
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
Has mailed this line

417
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,879
Between that the sort of rare Collectibles and

418
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,951
Play because there was actually a real card in the deck

419
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
It was called

420
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
The organ

421
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,327
It kind of looks like a blue dragon can a floating in space

422
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
Nobody could really explain to me

423
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:37,727
What the heck did what you could tell when somebody in the crowd open their pack

424
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
And pulled one out

425
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,831
Google is that cool

426
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
It's pretty cool

427
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
It's like 30 bucks right now

428
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,463
Alright I'm going to sell it

429
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
Maybe

430
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
Not the 2nd not the 2nd

431
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,399
This moment right here is exactly what the makers of magic cards wanted

432
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
This guy

433
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
Just got a rare card he was super excited

434
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,359
But rather than put it in a plastic case or frame rather than run to a dealer and try and sell it

435
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,151
He decides he's going to play with it

436
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,431
He decides he's going to go with the game

437
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,759
After the break

438
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,575
How much does Bugan Dragon cards are going for now

439
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,975

449
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
And here are a couple

450
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Quick updates

451
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,815

Play by play announcers hopped up on adrenaline

453
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
Is your world champion

454
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
I know it seems like

455
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,407
The magic League are going to get even bigger just a few weeks ago

456
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
Wizards of the Coast the company behind Magic

457
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,759
Then out something called The Magic Pro League

458
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:30,111
With 32 players each getting a contract of $75,000

459
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,927
And they'll be 10 million dollars in prizes up

460
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
Big money makers

461
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
And

462
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
Guess it evident

463
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
They also had this Flash

464
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
Promo video with

465
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:47,007
Sir Mix-A-Lot the 90s rapper

466
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:53,407
Kid that Whispers feel that respect

467
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Next update

468
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
On the value of the cars themselves the economic

469
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:04,927
That you can dragon card that everybody wanted at the store when Robert and Bowie went there

470
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,231
I just look it up online here in mm

471
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,023
18 and it is

472
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
Holding its value

473
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,839
Demon going up a little bit was

474
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
$30 back then

475
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,239
And now you can find it for $50 all the way up to $150.

476
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
Depending on the addition

477
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,103
To even with all that work at Wizards of the Coast is doing to

478
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,663
To keep the cards for playing and not collecting

479
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
Not totally working

480
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
Black lotus

481
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,295
That is still super valuable

482
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,879
So valuable that this past July 1 sold on eBay for
