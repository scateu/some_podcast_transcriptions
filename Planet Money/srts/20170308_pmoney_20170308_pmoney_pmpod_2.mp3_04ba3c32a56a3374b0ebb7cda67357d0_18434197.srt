00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,048
Hey it's Robert Smith here

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,840
These days as a reporter

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,632
You can never be too careful

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:08,448
And that's why I hear Planet Money occasionally

5
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,288
We send messages using an encrypted messaging app called

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,312
Signal

7
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:17,152
That is bit of Technology promises that no one can ever intercept

8
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:17,920
Or we

9
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:18,944
Your text

10
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,248
Yesterday I got a message

11
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,552
On signal from a reporter friend

12
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,832
And the message said

13
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,368
The CIA has

14
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,392
Figured out a way

15
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,160
To read

16
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
These messages

17
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,744
Now perhaps you saw this news to

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,840
Wikileaks has released a bunch of stolen documents from the CIA

19
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,120
It is a list of

20
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,192
Did the CIA uses to spy on people

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,056
And it's not that they can't actually break the encryption on apps

22
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,104
Signal but they found a way around it

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,944
Which is the CIT basically figured out how to get inside your phone

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712
And watch

25
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,736
What you type

26
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,272
Listen to what you say

27
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,880
Effective also apparently hacked the Samsung voice activated TV

28
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,928
So the CIA can listen hit

29
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,464
When you're talking in the room

30
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,488
Or yelling back

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,512
Apple TV

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
Now the documents don't reveal how the CIA crack

33
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,608
The system

34
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,656
How they found the secret doors

35
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
In your phone

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
TV

37
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
Perhaps they have young people you know in a warehouse in Langley Virginia high on Red Bull you know and all night

38
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,384
Or

39
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,432
Perhaps the CIA

40
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,712
Online

41
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,528
Because there is a booming Marketplace

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,576
4 secret backdoor

43
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
Into technology

44
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,672
As soon as I read these news articles I thought oh

45
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,952
We did a story

46
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,048
About just this very thing about hackers for hire

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
About people who

48
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,912
Professionally their job is the hunt for Flaws in your smartphone

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,984
And sell that knowledge to the highest bidder

50
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
The story focused on a loner

51
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,104
A single hacker a tall gangly guy

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
Would never before told his story

53
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,480
I don't want to be known as somebody who talks

54
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
But I'm just saying you know

55
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:03,648
You came to an ass there's a market for this stuff absolutely there is

56
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,512
The show originally aired in 2015

57
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,816
But it literally allowed me to understand

58
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
The news that is happening right now

59
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
So I will let the original host

60
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
Take it from here

61
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,496
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Steve Hatton

64
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,040
It's a story about a million dollar deal

65
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
Friendship

66
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
Betrayal

Aarthi you were the first person to tell me about

79
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
This loner who discovered this one particular

80
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
Yes

81
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,080

Kids with Boston Terrier named Marley

100
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,935
People don't you do not fight

101
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
Don't do that

102
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,799
Jonathan grew up as one of those computer savant

103
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
Can you how to get into

104
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,847
Any system

105
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Videos

106
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,687
Thought of himself as one of these good guys he still does

107
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,759
I'd say she helps the largest companies in the world

108
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
Find bugs

109
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
Security flaws

110
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,623
But at night he would poke around on its own

111
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Ignite

112
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
He worked for himself

113
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,999
And had a hacker name an alter ego

114
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
Johnny Mnemonic

115
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,607
It's from the old science fiction story about a guy with

116
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
Computer for

117
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,983
At first When Johnny Comes flaws in major software programs

118
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Tell the company

119
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
Open fix

120
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
But he got

121
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
Frustrated

122
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
He said lots of times these companies ignored him

123
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
Didn't fix the problem

124
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,271
Or maybe just offered to make tiny token in payments

125
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Deserve

126
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
Major

127
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Companies

128
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159
Employing the best developers in the world

129
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,487
And for years we got paid zilch nothing

130
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,583
For finding these vulnerabilities in writing exploits for them so you know what

131
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Like

132
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
Get paid for your work

133
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:32,799
If you find a flaw in a piece of software there are a lot of other people who will

134
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
Hey for that information

135
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,639
Especially if no one else knows about it

136
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,711
In fact there's a specific term for this kind of information

137
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
It's called a zero Day Hack

138
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,367
0 as in it's been 0 days since the rest of the world has known

139
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
No one knows

140
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,207
Not even the guys who wrote the software

141
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,023
Johnny Mnemonic started to make extra cash

142
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
Searching for these 0 days

143
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,607
In his spare time

144
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,935
You make a few thousand dollars here or there selling this information

145
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
It's legal

146
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,775
Just point out software flaws and sell them

147
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:09,151
Even if Johnny never exactly knew for sure who the buyers were

148
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
Or how they were using the hacks

149
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,783
His million-dollar discovery of this flaw in the iPhone

150
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
Started the same way

151
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
Just like these other

152
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,415
Yeah I remember exactly where I was

153
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
I was actually in Redmond

154
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,559
Working back in those days in 2013

155
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,399
Johnny was in Redmond Washington and he was working for Microsoft

156
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
On a contract so by David clock in

157
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,775
And in the evenings he be sitting on a sofa

158
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,335
Pouring over source code for Apple

159
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,895
The stuff that powered the MacBook and the iPhone

160
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,455
Okay so in the green first

161
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,271
Register system

162
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,111
Precursor this means to store this structure pointer

163
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
Johnny's reading from a black screen

164
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,511
Just a mash of in decipherable characters letters numbers

165
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,095
It was indexing something

166
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
And Johnny would sit on his couch

167
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
In Redmond and just

168
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
Pour through this code

169
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
All night

170
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,383
It's boring work really boring work

171
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,455
Hunched over looking for Treasure it's crazy

172
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,271
And it's all about patience and persistence

173
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,087
And eventually Johnny finds his

174
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
Little gold coin

175
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:26,719
Tg3 underscore soft CCA star soft sequels get soft

176
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
See

177
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Friends

178
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,535
Johnny Lewis

179
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,631
Every piece of software even Apple's latest

180
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
Fancy stuff

181
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Is old school

182
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
Cobble together from other bits

183
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Software

184
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,543
And that like the one you just read

185
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
Believe it or not

186
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,639
Was Infamous back in the 90s for triggering

187
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,431
What was called an index in

188
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
There was

189
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,015
A vintage 1990s watch

190
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,343
Sitting in the middle of Apple's brand new iPhone

191
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,463
I wanted to see if it was what I thought it was you know you played bugs away I play 90s hip-hop

192
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Yeah

193
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,327
These operating systems are built like fortresses or jails

194
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,911
What Johnny had discovered was a secret door through just

195
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
One wall

196
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:13,311
It was an important wall a wall that separated the inner sanctum of Apple system

197
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
But

198
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
And this is also important

199
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,175
He didn't have the key to open up that

200
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
No one

201
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,039
And that's kind of why Johnny didn't realize he was holding onto gold

202
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
He sat there on the couch

203
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
Told a few friends about his

204
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Discovery

205
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:31,487
I thought that maybe somewhere down the line down the road he'd sell it for a few thousand bucks

206
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
Someone who cares

207
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
Which I didn't know

208
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,327
Was at that moment

209
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
There are a bunch of Chinese businessmen

210
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,679
Who adjust offered a vast

211
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
Sum of money

212
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,031
To the person who could find an open that door

213
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,895
Now I'm about to play you a phone call that was recorded its home around this time

214
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,223
The boys are going to hear is a broker of sore

215
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,527
This is a guy who hooks up hackers

216
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
With people who want to buy their hats

217
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
This guy's name is

218
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Hi

219
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
Crazy parties

220
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,511
When this ship pops off cuz it's going to pop off big

221
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
You already know

222
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,959
Norfolk is over here don't know I had something to do with it I'm just going to I don't know nothing

223
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,263
Tired heard about Johnny Secret Door

224
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
Because one of Johnny's on Friends

225
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Sold them out

226
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
And now that I need you

227
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,663
He approached one of the best digital lock

228
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
Pickers on the planet

229
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,247
A hacker known as go hot

230
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,551
Who's the guy on the other end of this phone call

231
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
And even if what he's saying makes no sense

232
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
Just listen free

233
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Excitement in his voice

234
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Here is the plan

235
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
Take Johnny's discovery

236
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
Basically have GL hot

237
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,775
Make some keys that unlock that secret door

238
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,591
And then sell this is a package deal to the Chinese

239
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
One-time-only

240
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,175
The secret to taking over the eye

241
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
Listen bro it'll be cool

242
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,623
We'll set it up I'll shoot over to China you shoot over there

243
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,023
Let him meet you that dale dale f****** go ain't nothing meet go hiding hey how you doing blah blah blah blah

244
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
I recorded this call for a Chinese buyer

245
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
Eventually it leaked

246
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
Out online

247
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
And we verified who was on the

248
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Call

249
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,543
The Chinese businessman one of the iPhone hack

250
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
For a very

251
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Specific reason

252
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,687
You know how the iPhone makes you go get your apps from the iPhone store

253
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,527
Apple takes a cut of everything controls everything is Apple's money

254
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
But with this hack

255
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
That changes

256
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,927
The Chinese businessman get the keys to break out of Apple's jail

257
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,975
To jailbreak so to speak

258
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
The phone

259
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:45,375
And then they set up their own app store so that customers buy directly from them

260
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,935
The Chinese businessmen get the profits

261
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Not Apple

262
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,543
In the Chinese businessmen were willing to pay a lot of money

263
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:58,431
Clear

264
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
300 Yuan 350000

265
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,135
$350,000

266
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Is just

267
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
Geo hot

268
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
That's it

269
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,327
There is no discussion of giving the money to Johnny Mnemonic or is for

270
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,887
You guys are going to keep the prize

271
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Themselves

272
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
How do you want the money sent directly

273
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,519
To you you want to send to me listen to you

274
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,895
Listen

275
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,943
We could do it like this

276
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,271
Because I do have the company I'm paying you as a developer

277
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,623
You follow me my Mercedes list 1000

278
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,695
It'll look good nice paper trail

279
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:46,303
So Thai and Gio hot already spending the money their minds and Johnny Mnemonic

280
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,351
He's back working is Corporate gig

281
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
An office room for hire

282
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
He has no idea this is going down

283
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
But remember

284
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
This is a race

285
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,079
And while these guys are joking around on tape

286
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
Another group of hackers

287
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
Guess to the Finish Line first

288
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:08,575
My name is David Wong I go by Planet being on the internet and a member of The Debaters

289
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
The Invaders

290
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
4 guys

291
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
Spread across three continents

292
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,487
Who came up with a superhero like me

293
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
The Invaders

294
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,095
They also heard about Johnny Mnemonic Secret Door

295
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,959
And they cut a deal with a different group of Chinese businessmen with their own app store

296
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,543
That deal was for $1000000

297
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,127
Is incredible life-changing amount of money

298
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
And

299
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
You know I was

300
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
Really shocked

301
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
I was

302
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
That was

303
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Flabbergast

304
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
I know

305
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,671
When it comes to hacking the iPhone David Wong is a rock

306
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
To contact in China

307
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
Flew him and his entire team

308
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
All the Invaders to China

309
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
All-expenses-paid

310
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,679
There it was it was pretty incredible for for everyone

311
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,983
The million dollar Highway

312
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,287
Here's the weird thing about the hacker world

313
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
Well the race is on everything is

314
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
Secret and opaque no one wants

315
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,455
The talk too much about money or how they get what they got

316
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
Or what color they're trying to crack

317
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
And if you talk too much

318
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
You can get burned

319
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,855
David Wong Tesla guy Johnny new

320
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
Canoe about Johnny's Secret Door

321
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Send it

322
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
To the evaders

323
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
Hoping that they all could work together

324
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
David

325
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,839
30 turned him down and then he never looked

326
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
And this is why you don't talk

327
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,983
Johnny's Discovery was now worth hundreds of thousands of dollars

328
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,543
And people were peddling it behind his back

329
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,615
In the end the evaders won this race

330
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,431
We figured out how to jailbreak the iPhone 5S

331
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Before anyone else

332
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,503
They could get around Apple's walls

333
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,807
Even use any software or any apps they wanted

334
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
On the iPhone

335
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
I remembered it struck a deal with a Chinese

336
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Company

337
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
Basically how that deal work

338
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,023
When users in China wanted to use apps that Apple doesn't

339
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Approve of

340
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
It going download this hack

341
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
Does jailbreak

342
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,959
And that meant they automatically download the software for this Chinese companies apps

343
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,543
For a whole bunch of reasons were not going to get into cuz it's complicated

344
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
Jailbreaking phones in China is in

345
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
Credibly,

346
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
So this hack

347
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,943
Was incredibly valuable

348
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,271
App Store charge Commission on every app they sell

349
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,087
Millions of people were downloading this job

350
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,903
That's why this was a million-dollar hat

351
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
Now where did this happen again

352
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
The spread on the internet and

353
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Twitter

354
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,351
And suddenly everyone knew David Wong in the Invaders were responsive

355
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,911
And that's when Johnny Mnemonic

356
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Found out

357
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
And the more he read

358
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
The matter he got

359
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
It was his secret door

360
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
Cheney Witt

361
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
He recognized it

362
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,871
Battles fought from the 90s

363
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
It was his fine

364
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
After eye surgery

365
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,503
Found out the entire story from talking to

366
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
Other people

367
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:54,207
Then I put it together in like I was kind of like I felt used

368
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
Used

369
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
Johnny Played it over in his head

370
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
He knows everything about

371
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,167
But he didn't realize just how big and Cutthroat the market

372
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
For this hack was going

373
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,775
He never thought that one of his friends

374
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Turn on

375
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Selma

376
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
And that's

377
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
Certify felons

378
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Trap here like

379
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,479
I didn't know the background of the you know a certain individuals

380
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,831
You know I was from a different scene I just didn't know these people like

381
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
You know you have to know

382
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,439
Everybody that you're working with and I just

383
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Young

384
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
What you're saying is that you trusted the wrong car

385
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,583
Yeah I've basically yeah

386
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,655
This is the problem with quasi-legal markets

387
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Like this one

388
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
There are no rules no Watch Dogs

389
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
No court system to protect

390
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
Your discovery

391
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,079
It's winner-take-all

392
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
You snooze you lose

393
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,431
It slowly changing though in ways you might not expect

394
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
Companies that make this

395
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Stop the software

396
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,319
Companies like Google and Facebook have woken up to the fact that

397
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
This Market in flaws

398
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
Exist

399
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,695
They've decided since they can't kill what they can't control it

400
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
They can't stop

401
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
They're going to join it

402
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,583
Do companies are beginning to pay real money

403
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,375
Solo hackers like Johnny

404
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,679
That way they can get these flaws

405
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
Find these holes in seal them up

406
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
Before someone turns the key

407
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
They weren't new versions of

408
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
The software release

409
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Millions of songs

410
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
Fix the bug

411
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
And then of course

412
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
That race

413
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
The break-in

414
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,271
It starts all over again

415
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:30,975
One short epilogue about that million-dollar hack the one that David Wong on his team tried to put together

416
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Well it fell apart

417
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,839
After they made the deal with the Chinese the hacker world

418
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
Loaded and anger

419
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,215
This new Chinese app store it turns out the one made possible by the Secret Door

420
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
It was spelled with

421
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,567
Pirated software and computer programmers were pissed

422
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
It was a torrent it was overwhelming

423
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
It made me feel really really terrible

424
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,527
I don't know they were just angry and yelling I didn't want to read most of it

425
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,831
So David Wang and his team cancelled

426
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Their deal

427
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
They basically tank

428
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
That Chinese app store

429
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
And Wong says

430
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Heinous team

431
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
Never collected

432
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375

435
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959

446
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,607
After the news came out this week about the cia's tools to hack iPhones

447
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
We of course

448
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Immediately thought

449
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,447
I wonder if Chinese involved

450
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,287
So we tracked him down this week to see if you're still in the zero-day business

451
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,591
And if you sold any CIA

452
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,663
He says he's working for a Fortune 100 company now

453
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
But he still does exploit

454
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
Homicide

455
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
Andy says

456
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
Maybe they ended up with the CIA or

457
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Accompany

458
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,183
Maybe a foreign government you really have no idea

459
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,719
Dealers he works with

460
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Harlem

461
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:15,679
This episode was originally produced by Jess Jiang and fee of Benin today's version was produced by Elizabeth kulas

462
