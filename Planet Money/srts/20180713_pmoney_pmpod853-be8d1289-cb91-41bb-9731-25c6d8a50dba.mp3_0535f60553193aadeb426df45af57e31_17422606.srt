00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,728
There's this rustic Little Beach town in northern Jamaica one reggae bar on the beach with a tin roof

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,848
When the tropical rain comes out of nowhere everyone runs into this bar

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,504
A self-described Rastaman is in there singing reggae calling everyone girlfriend

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,600
Very first time I bless my eyes on you girl

5
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,928
It's not the kind of Beach town that tourists watch

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,464
This is a local

7
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,024

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,048

Everyone seems to want it

25
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,256

A lot in this area

30
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,192
You can hear the truck that Knights moving

Wit's end

32
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,520
In Jamaica sand is valuable

33
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,848
So valuable that a few years ago just down the road

34
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,128
An entire

35
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,152
Beach was

36
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Stolen

37
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,712
Thieves showed up in dumb

38
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,992
Trucks and just

39
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
Check off

40
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
The whole thing

41
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:35,488
Hundreds of tons of powdery white Caribbean sand

42
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,584
It happened in 2008 and Vicente was

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
Huge and that just in Jamaica it was a warning sign to the world that Saint had become this

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
Bing worth

45
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:53,152

Sarah Gonzales today on the show

47
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,064
There's not enough sand in the world for everyone and

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
We need that

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,464
Sand is a miracle material that is used in a whole bunch of things that we can't live without

50
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
You just

51
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
Looked around right now

52
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,376
The building that you are in or the sidewalk that you're on

53
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
It is made of sand

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,008
Because sand is a main ingredient in concrete

55
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,544
Also in class

56
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568

Quiet talker

73
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,720

He's modest

78

00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,984
Eternal unprivate

80
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,288
Mr Bob Marley

81
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
Lawyer

82
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,968
You are the lawyer for the Bob Marley family

83
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Midas

84
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,856
I don't know because it's so.

85
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
Somebody has to do

86
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
Michael was running what is a

87
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,464
Essentially the justice department in

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,536
Jamaica and then he decided to go into private practice

89
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
And in 2008 he gets

90
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
Call a beach

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
Has been stolen

92
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
Taken

93
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,216
In the dead of the night

94
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
Hauled out

95
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
Inductor

96
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
So there were Witnesses who saw

97
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
Trucks in the mud

98
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Boynton

99
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,200
But who could not say where the sun was beating

100
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,760
And Michael Hilton his job was to

101
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,808
Find this missing

102
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
Band

103
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
The challenge would be

104
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Pool

105
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,720
Weird assignment who took it and who benefited from it

106
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,280
The Michael heads to the scene of the crime

107
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:22,655
Drive town of Rocky overgrown dirt road goes past herds of goats and

108
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Hebrew

109
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
A mangrove

110
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
Forest

111
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,847
There's a crumbling medieval-looking Stone Castle on a hill and peeking out

112
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,967
Through the beautiful mango trees is that aqua blue Caribbean Sea

113
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
And then

114
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,087
He sees it

115
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
There were

116
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
Chords

117
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
That were

118
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
Probably

119
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,279
10 feet deep but there were holes

120
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,839
Weight benches

121
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Deep trenches

122
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
Like if someone went down one of these

123
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Probably would not be able to see the

124
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
Digging trenches like this

125
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,823
Would require some kind of excavator type of

126
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
Equipment

127
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,919
And was there is was there any way that you can like

128
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:12,063
Fill the whole leg just kind of move it around to fill the holes or

129
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
New Sun

130
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
They took almost

131
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
All the sand with them

132
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,231
So if you were in a boat you saw water

133
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Rose of

134
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,327
Flaw doubts and trenches and then

135
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
Trees

136
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Nobi

137
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,447
The amount that was stolen was not something that you could just

138
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Hiding somewhere

139
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
It was way too much sand

140
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
So Michael thinks

141
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
There has to be at

142
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Scrooged

143
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,407
Heil of sand somewhere on this

144
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,503
Silence there looking all over Jamaica but they don't find any big

145
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
Pile of sand

146
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
So Michael thinks

147
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
Descend

148
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
It must have been

149
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
Read outs

150
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
And where would sand be

151
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:54,047
Spread out and who has the money to buy a million dollars worth of

152
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
Stand

153
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,351
Beachfront Resort

154
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,167
They become Michaels primary suspects

155
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
Give me the points that was taken

156
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,775
It would almost certainly have gone

157
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:10,175
To do Beach building onto new Beach Building

158
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
Sometimes

159
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
Sand is also used

160
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Orsat

161
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
Michael Sands one of the owners of the stolen Beach

162
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,927
Ace and scientists and a Justice of the Peace

163
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
Animation

164
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
Up on a helicopter

165
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
The justice of the peace is kind of like a notary who

166
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,655
Only job is to corroborate what happens on this helicopter and

167
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,959
Make sure no one tampers with the evidence

168
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
And this is

169
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,543
Scrappy eagle-eyed sand Squad

170
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
They noticed something

171
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
At two particular Hotel

172
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
These hotels look

173
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,711
Like they were built on beaches that had Brown

174
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
Sad

175
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
They kind of look like

176
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,343
White sand have been sprinkled over the Browns and

177
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
Vivian Ariel

178
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
We are

179
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
The sand was

180
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
Hi the brown or Spurs

181
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
And then suddenly

182
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:03,167
There was a very large stretch of new white expensive sun

183
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,703
Stolen white sand

184
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
I just need to

185
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
To prove it

186
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,079
The pilot lands the helicopter on the border of one of these

187
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Pirate Resort

188
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
The saint scientist

189
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
Runs Out

190
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
Collect some sand samples and then runs back on to that

191
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,063
And while they were flying around in Helen

192
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Copters

193
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
A guy from the United Nations

194
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
With wandering around the beaches

195
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
Hello can you hear us over there

196
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
Yes absolutely hello Sarah

197
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
This is Pascal

198
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
I'm Pascal Potosi

199
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
I'm from Switzerland

200
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,679
Pascal's with the environmental arm of the United

201
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
He happened to be in Jamaica at the time

202
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,823
Doing research for the UN talking to the locals

203
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,919
In one Village we people told us that's a some people came off of night

204
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
Yeah the guns

205
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
And trucks

206
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,295
And they stole $0.02 is sold at beachway of annoyed

207
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,623
And Pascal studies Coastal erosion so

208
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,463
Houston beaches disappearing but like over hundreds of

209
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
Years

210
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,559
And here they're telling him a beach vanished overnight

211
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
How could that happen

212
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
So he starts

213
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Studying the Sandman

214
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,239
And he discovers that this Santa Fe in Jamaica is

215
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
Is just one tiny part of a

216
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Huge and

217
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
Growing

218
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Sand

219
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,383
Shortage and

220
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,431
A ton of money is at stake

221
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
How to say businesses b****

222
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
The very minimum 250 billion dollar per year

223
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Legally

224
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
But humans are extracting sand

225
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
Faster than the Earth

226
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
Create space

227
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Because it

228
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
Takes forever to me

229
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,607
And we don't recycle sign

230
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
1 sand is

231
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:43,263
Trapped into concrete it's trapped in there forever it doesn't come back as

232
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Sad

233
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,359
This makes the sand industry a linear

234
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Economy

235
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,223
So Pascal takes all of his research and he publishes a report

236
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Closet

237
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Stand

238
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
Rarer than one thinks

239
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,647
You even think likes and he's just he's coming material that we all know we week

240
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,463
Going to beach with a very familiar with that and we think it's just

241
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
Infinite

242
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Eddie smokes

243
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,559
And where sand is running out

244
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
Things are getting

245
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Violence

246
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,959
And 5 people have been killed in Mexico a ninja and probably many other areas

247
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
Just for Fen destruction

248
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,871
There is a ton of desert sand on the planet but nobody wants

249
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
That's sad

250
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
And that's because

251
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,831
Not all sand is created equal desert sand like from the Sahara it's too smooth and silky

252
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
Need to be used for construction

253
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
So when Dubai which is

254
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
Of course I play surrounded by desert

255
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,791
Sand was trying to build the tallest building in the world

256
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
I had to import the right kind

257
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
Sand from

258
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Australia

259
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
They needed the grainy

260
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Greedy kind of sand

261
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,263
The kind that comes from either River bottoms

262
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Or Beach

263
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
That's the good

264
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,383
Stuff that's the stuff that can be used for construction

265
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
And Beach replenishment

266
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,967
And Pascal says the biggest

267
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,271
Sand importer in the world these days

268
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Singapore

269
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
They have imported

270
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,111
Hundreds of millions of

271
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
Tons of sand

272
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,231
Singapore is in terms of landmass they don't have a whole lot where do they

273
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
Put their sand

274
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,071
08 they do see the Reclamation so that they take you take

275
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,375
Spend a Toy Story by placing Sam

276
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
Into the sea

277
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,215
Singapore dumps all of this and that it buys on TV

278
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
The edges of the cut

279
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
Treat to make

280
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
Singapore

281
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Bigger

282
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
Since the 1970s Singapore has it

283
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,711
Expanded its territory by 20%

284
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
It has changed its countries

285
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
Borders you can see this

286
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
From satellite images

287
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:39,743
We can see that by satellite you use what used to be water is now temperature you is buildings on it

288
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,071
The water in some areas been replaced by buildings

289
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
And those bloody well build on sand

290
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,191
Singapore used to get all of its sand from

291
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Vietnam

292
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
Thailand and Indonesia

293
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
But then

294
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,615
Vietnam Thailand and Indonesia started

295
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Shrinking

296
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
They were literally

297
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
Selling their countries

298
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
To Singapore

299
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,063
The UN says around twenty-four Indonesian Islands

300
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Disappeared

301
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
They no longer exist

302
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,415
Because all of their sand

303
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
Went to Singapore

304
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,767
Nope Pascal he did eventually leave Jamaica

305
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
Michael

306
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,607
He would be on the trail of the missing sand

307
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
4 years

308
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
After the break

309
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
We go back

310
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447

00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,559
Okay so Michael has suspect

319
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
Beachfront Resort

320
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,655
To all inclusive luxury resorts are at

321
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
Accused of buying the

322
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
The stolen sand

323
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,031
And no one thinks that these hotels actually went

324
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
To the beach in

325
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
Took off with all the sand

326
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,639
The hotel say we bought this and

327
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
Legally from a sand Mining Company

328
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,503
Michael Michael is like

329
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,551
You guys should have known that this was stolen

330
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,599
Property you were Reckless

331
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
And so

332
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
You should have to pay for the damage

333
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
First

334
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
Michael needs to prove that the

335
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,791
White sand grains they saw from the helicopter in

336
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Snuck off with

337
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
Came from his b

338
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
Beach he hires

339
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,519
Sedimentologist and marine geologist to run forensics on these tiny white sangria

340
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
But it gets

341
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
Complicated because

342
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,663
These hotels are raking the sand in the middle of the night

343
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,991
The Rake The Sand

344
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
3 a.m. 4 a.m.

345
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
The wrecking the Stalin

346
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
Son of the beach

347
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
What does that mean like they just like

348
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
Smooth it out

349
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,975
So that it doesn't look like people walked on it

350
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:51,839
Why do they do that

351
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
Resort Hotels also

352
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,007
Yank out the grass from the bottom of the ocean so that luxury resort feet don't get grazed

353
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
To buy seagrass

354
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,919
At least her is who demand their unlocked on Sand with no grass they are messing up my

355
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
Forensic work

356
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,527
Because the old saying in the new sandroll mixing together

357
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
Send forensics

358
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
But luckily for Michael there are also

359
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
Pebble forensics

360
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
And while Michael is hanging out with

361
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Pebble expert

362
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
The hotels at

363
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
Accused of buying the stolen sand are flying in their own X

364
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
To do their own saint

365
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
And forensic

366
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,775
And Jamaican police are also on the sand forensic be

367
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,079
They're knocking on these Hotel doors like

368
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
Excuse me we have a warrant

369
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
You collect some sand samples

370
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
There was a hole

371
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Criminal

372
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,551
Who would have brought the criminal case

373
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
Crown

374
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
As in

375
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Queen Elizabeth

376
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:53,279
Cuz she's a queen of Jamaica

377
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
Jamaica is part of the

378
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
The Commonwealth the old British colonies

379
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
And Nobody messes

380
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Shoes with the monarchs

381
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,775
So this sand theft is so massive that it becomes of Interest

382
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,335
Not just to Jamaica but also to England

383
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,151
Because you don't still beaches

384
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
From parts of anybody's country

385
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:16,063
That's Mark Shields he was ahead of the national police force in Jamaica during this

386
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,135
Highspots Easter eggs in the US if you

387
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:25,279
Decided to go to the Grand Canyon and take a huge portion of the sand and rock from the Grand Canyon I think probably the Americans would have

388
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
Something to say about that

389
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
Bet you can't do that

390
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,935
It was just too much than to not have been noticed by a lot of pee

391
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
People throw

392
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
Mark is thinking

393
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,031
How many people were involved in this

394
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
End

395
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,871
How high did this crime go up

396
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
There were allegations that police

397
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,991
Were escorting these dump trucks helping them make

398
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
A clean getaway

399
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,087
Quite clearly the police would not

400
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,903
Under normal circumstances be escorting

401
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Send

402
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
From one location to another

403
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
Years into this case

404
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,583
The crown says that their main witness starts getting

405
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Death

406
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,167
Threats real and specific intimidation

407
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
And they said

408
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
The witness

409
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
No longer wants to

410
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Dubai

411
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
And the crown is forced

412
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
Drop the charge

413
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,359
It was clearly

414
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,407
Quite a conspiracy

415
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Panda

416
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,503
Some of the people to be involved in this will be quite influential

417
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,343
And on the Civil side the judge decided you know what

418
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
This would be a great time to retire

419
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,951
She retires in the middle of the

420
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,487
The case without giving a verdict

421
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
So in the end the hotels.

422
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Just settled

423
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
Without admitting

424
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
Jamaica's

425
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,703
Great Sand Heist so big the evidence

426
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,751
A scene from a helicopter

427
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
Whoever did it

428
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
Got away with it

429
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
My disappointment in this case

430
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
Ace Hotel

431
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,967
There's a part of me that would prefer to block

432
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
Then the nethercutt net worth

433
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
It's not my favorite

434
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,487
Instance that theft and the UN report the problem has just gotten worse

435
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
In India alone

436
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
The UN is aware of

437
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,863
Thousands of illegal sand mining site

438
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,703
And you know we can't live in a world without sin

439
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
And it is to import

440
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
Soap Pascal says

441
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
We just have to be

442
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
Smarter about how we

443
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Used San

444
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
He says we could just

445
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,991
Simply used less of it we could make our buildings with thinner concrete walls or

446
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
We could use

447
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
Different ingredients

448
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
What's in concrete like

449
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Sawdust

450
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
And Ashes

451
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
You can actually add chemicals

452
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,975
To desert sand to make it sturdy enough to use for construction

453
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
These are all

454
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
Real alternatives

455
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
It's

456
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,887
Just a little bit more complicated to build this way

457
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
Luxury resorts are

458
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
Probably not going to

459
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
To start dumping Sawdust

460
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
And Ashes onto there be

461
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,127
Taurus will continue to demand their powdery White

462
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Perfect fan

463
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,479
When I was in Jamaica I went to one of the Resort's that was a

464
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
Accused of buying that stolen sad

465
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,367
Pools and bars and rum

466
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Everywhere

467
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
Are catamarans and

468
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
Tiki huts on stilts

469
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
In the middle of the water

470
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
And of course

471
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
Big

472
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
Expensive

473
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
White sand

474
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,167
And everyone I spoke to for the story told me the same thing

475
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
Wherever

476
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,983
Is Hotel got that white

477
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,031
Sam from all those years ago

478
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
That sound

479
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,591
Is long gone

480
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
I was

481
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,967
Probably standing on a new batch of whites and that they brought in from some other B

482
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
The thing about Saint

483
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,927
It comes and goes with the waves sand is always on the move

484
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:40,095
