1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,048
This is Panama

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,680
There is something about

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,448
A food cup

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,728
You know like

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,264
Top Chef chopped

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
My personal favorite

7
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,568
The Great British Bake Off

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,664
That to me is Magic

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,272
And I think what it is is something that we all have to do everyday

10
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,552
A chore

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,856
And make it into a drop

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,392
We are still alive

13
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,720
I personally didn't want Jamie to have

14
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:36,864
To do a crappy dip you didn't at all your own dishes

15
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
So good

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,680
Empty the other day

17
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:44,288
I got to talk to one of the people who not only knows the tricks that these shows use

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,568
She invented some

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,408
All right before we start can you just introduce yourself

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,944
I'm done in Martinez

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,528
I'm the executive producer / showrunner of Top Chef

22
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
And what was your

23
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
First job

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,648
I was a production assistant season 1

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,184
You start at the bottom

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,952
Now you're the boss

27
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:02,976
Yeah

28
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,256
Janine and I got

29
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,024
The talking about her

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,584
Show it's now headed into its 17

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
But honestly

32
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,704
Pretty soon our conversation just turned into this like

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
Therapy /

34
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
Advice session

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,032
For producers

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
We

37
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,920
Do a lot of shows around here at Planet Money

38
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,968
Recovery economics

39
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,272
Every single day business and economics

40
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
And

41
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,064
We

42
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,136
You know it starts to be the same sort of thing

43
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
Not to say it's boring but you know what

44
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
Betrayed

45
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
Reserved

46
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
Okay and

47
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,072
What we are looking to talk

48
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Do you about today

49
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
Is how to take something that may seem mundane

50
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Like cooking

51
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216

00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
For you to teach us some of the tricks of food competition shows

54
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,200
So that we can use them to spice up our

55
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
That sound cool

56
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272

Pretty weird question

66
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,592

What are you doing here again

87
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,056
I read a newsletter

00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,872
Where can people get that sweet sweet content

89
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,712
Npr.org Planet Money newsletter that's what I can say

90
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
That's what they contain up yet

91
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,184
So what we're going to do today is

92
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
Is bringing

93
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
Of the reporter

94
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,536
They already know the listener question they're going to Aunt

95
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,096
What they do not know ahead of time

96
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Is there

97
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
Challenge

98
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,936
They do not know the tricks that I learned

99
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
From

100
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,520
Executive producer Danny norkinas

101
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Tremendous

102
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,872
First one we talked about

103
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,944
Kind of old hat for food competition shows

104
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
But it's maybe my favorite ingredient you guys use the surprise ingredient

105
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,696
We do try to do too much cuz there are a lot of shows that do that

106
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
So it's kind of a Trope at this point yeah

107
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,447
Ingredients for you at

108
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
What what is it about

109
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
Surprising

110
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
Because

111
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
It's one of those things where it's like

112
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
It's very straightforward

113
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
People can see it

114
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
And then they can t even do it at home

115
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
Easy

116
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
Simple effective

117
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,319
Not yet a Trope in radio journalism

118
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
Let's do it

119
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,439
Our first question comes from Alicia ardoin

120
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
In California

121
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,535
And Alicia had heard something about choco pie

122
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
Switcher Sardis like

123
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,887
Whoopie pie moon pie small things

124
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
She heard that they became part

125
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,727
Of the underground economy

126
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
In North Korea

127
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
And she wanted to know more

128
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
So I asked Elise you welcome

129
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
I feel a sense

130
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Some dread

131
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Good

132
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
You started NPR south

133
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Bureau

134
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,295
You covered North Korea

135
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
A ton

136
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
What is going on

137
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Which occupies

138
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
North Koreans love

139
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,999
I'm going to interrupt you

140
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,815
Yes before you tell us about choco pies

141
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607
Okay

142
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
The producer at the NPR

143
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
Pets in La where you work

144
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
Should be coming in

145
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
We ask Mary to

146
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Scrounger on the office

147
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
And find a secret ingredient

148
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Do you have to work into your side

149
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
A can of tuna

150
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
Euro I know you always

151
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
That is your surprise ingredient

152
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:46,367
And you have to figure out a way to work that into your story on choco pies go

153
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,487
Okay so choco pies are choco pies as we call it choco pies is there no

154
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
Nincada Korean

155
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Language

156
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
Figure into geopolitics

157
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
The politics of North Korea and South Korea

158
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
Because

159
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
While they were

160
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
Popular in South Korea like this

161
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Since the 90

162
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
1870s they weren't introduced

163
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
Two North Korean until 2000

164
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
4

165
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
What happened in 2000

166
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
So they made their way up

167
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
Across the border through something called the

168
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
Kaesong industrial complex

169
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
This was a

170
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
Joint North

171
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
South

172
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
Special economic

173
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,791
This is like an industrial Zone there is North Korean workers working at South Korean factories

174
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
Making shoes and clothes and whatever

175
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
Yeah it's usually cheap

176
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
Alright so it's a lot of manufacturing going on

177
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
And

178
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,519
They're just one Factory after another out there

179
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,591
Okay bring this back to choco pies and or tuna

180
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
Okay so

181
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,687
The reason choco pies come into play is

182
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,807
North Korean workers who labored there they weren't actually paid directly by their bosses

183
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
The

184
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
South Korean businesses had to

185
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
To pay the North Korean regime

186
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
So we don't know how much the worker

187
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Actually

188
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
Okay

189
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,095
Korean managers could do is pay in snacks

190
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:04,959
And at first it was delicious right when they were first introduced some 15 years ago was like okay

191
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,311
The fun snack I get a reward but after your 5th choco pie

192
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,919
Not so great right which then created this burgeoning

193
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
Choco pie

194
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
Black Market

195
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
It is not a capital

196
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,831
Country but there is a rather

197
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
Lively Black Market

198
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:26,463
And so North Korean workers and stop eating the choco pies

199
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
And start selling them

200
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
In order to me

201
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
The money on the black

202
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
2 by the sea

203
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
But they wanted

204
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
I can imagine that the North Korean government

205
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
Did not appreciate

206
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
These

207
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
Symbols of capitalism

208
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,079
Seeping into everyday life

209
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,871
Right plus they filled the black market

210
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,943
So in 2014 North Korea band

211
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
And the result

212
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
Is

213
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
The black mark

214
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
Value of choco pies jump from

215
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
One US dollar

216
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
10 US dollars

217
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,695
Do you have any sense of like how much say

218
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:03,327
A can of tuna would go for on the black market look at YouTube

219
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,655
And you still haven't tied it together so bring it home what is this mean

220
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
For North Korea and the

221
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,751
Often North Koreans

222
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,311
North Korean fishermen defect

223
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
In order to get into South

224
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
Korea by boat

225
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
Okay and

226
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,223
I guess occasionally they are fishing for

227
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Tuna

228
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
Right

229
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,831
Choco pies are also

230
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Huge factor in a

231
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
Defector story

232
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
From

233
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
November of 27

234
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
Okay

235
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
Tell me that story where was it

236
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
The 24-year old North

237
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:38,655
Korean Defector who made a daring Escape across that border work with a little

238
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
Blue Hut sorry that you probably

239
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,543
He ran through that border in November of

240
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
He was shot at

241
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
By his fellow soldiers

242
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
40 *

243
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,199
And then eventually rescued by South Kerr

244
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
US soldier

245
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Turn on the other side

246
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,039
What's he woke up

247
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
The first thing he asked was

248
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
I can if

249
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,255
We know that he definitely asked for a Choco pie we don't know what fish he asked for but if possible

250
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,559
Anyway still Orion the company

251
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
That makes choco pies

252
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
Set a hundred boxes

253
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
Is of them to his hospital room

254
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
And then

255
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Is

256
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Continuing to

257
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
Supply him for life

258
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,335
Lifetime supply of choco pie

259
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,735
Elise you nailed your assignment thank you for sneaking that

260
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:31,135
Got into this very informative interview

261
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:47,519
Okay what's the newest member of the Planet Money Team

262
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
What's your listener Quest

263
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,359
Okay so my listener question is

264
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
How do you get the

265
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
The best salad value-wise at a salad bar

266
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
Consumption diamond in Somerville Massachusetts

267
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,807
But before you answer the question

268
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
I asked anene

269
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,647
How Top Chef might have gone about making mistakes

270
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
Limitations

271
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,999
You do some challenges on location

272
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,559
So they're in a new

273
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
Places I've never been before

274
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
New equipment that I've never used before

275
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,959
You know they have to figure out

276
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,519
How they're going to work within the space they never seen

277
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,871
And then kind of work with what's their like let's say it's we take them camping and there's

278
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
An open flame

279
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
They've got a pot

280
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
They have to work with

281
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
So they're going to figure out

282
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
How to work around that

283
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
So I have this reporter

284
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Who is answering

285
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
A question about

286
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Salad bar

287
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Interesting

288
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
You think we should just make her

289
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,047
Do all her interviews at the

290
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
The salad bar

291
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
At rush hour

292
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
Absolutely

293
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
Liza are you ready

294
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
Fight get out of here and when you're back

295
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Tell me what happened

296
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
And we're back

297
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:02,015
Much like on a cooking show the thing we just talked about mere seconds ago is already complete

298
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Liza

299
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
What you get into

300
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,719
So I went out into the world looking for a salad bar where I could answer the question

301
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,559
We are Midtown expensive salads

302
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,655
Home of hundreds of businessmen lining up around the block to

303
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
To buy $20 salads in a posse box

304
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
So sad

305
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,335
15 straight shot 15 minute walk so I was looking for a salad bar

306
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:33,247
Rush Hour hey getting closer

307
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,135
Deli chain on Madison Avenue

308
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,279
So I asked the first person I met if there was someone I could talk to you about the salad

309
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:51,167
Got plenty to a manager and he pointed Me chords

310
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Southern

311
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,543
Apron I really don't know

312
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
Why

313
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,383
Events manager sent me his way

314
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
Well because

315
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,735
If you are a person getting a salad what do you do

316
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
Island

317
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
Bye

318
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
Like to be honest

319
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,439
You would never by Zella.

320
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
Yet so

321
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
Kate salad bar

322
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Needle

323
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Is there

324
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
New other foods to buy

325
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,215
Now that's the last option that I have

326
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Okay

327
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,775
I mean now I'll buy it

328
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:33,919
But if not I'll just get a burger

329
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,735
Like rolling his eyes and shaking his head and

330
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Smiling

331
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
Like he knows how much they overcharge

332
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
Play Pusha my little bit I was like

333
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,927
Even if you had to go to a salad bar what would your Saturday

334
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
And he

335
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
With basically like

336
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
My strategy

337
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,863
Is to walk around the salad bar

338
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
And

339
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:58,751
Open up the case that has the prepared food in it

340
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,103
Prepared food potato salads are made like in another state last night

341
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
You'd like

342
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
Common misconception

343
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
Look at this dude over here

344
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
We're selling it for 699 a pound

345
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
Can you go to the salad bar

346
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
You know how much cost

347
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
1099

348
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
No time for it

349
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,655
Okay don't be a snob don't avoid the pre-made salads

350
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
Did you have any other tips

351
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,727
No

352
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
He didn't

353
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:36,895
So if it was obviously not going to be that helpful I left a salad bar watch out on the Street Watching other 10 minutes

354
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:43,295
And I found salad bar advertising lunch I'm going to say how much pants

355
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,855
Salad bar meaning

356
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,695
They just put out the buffet and all that Foods were piled really

357
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
Perfect scoop

358
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
Taken out of them

359
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,095
There's other jazz music lovely soundtrack

360
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
So I got there any message

361
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
This guy Tony Lee

362
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
Tony is the guy who buys everything

363
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:07,359
He knows exactly how much money they're making and losing on everything they sell

364
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:13,503
And he was not about to tell me all his Secrets but he had one very basic steps that he was

365
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
Willing to share

366
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,927
Recommended people don't get too much of the right when you get this much the rice

367
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,743
Yeah you're you're making like a Jamaican like a bit

368
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,047
Daylight

369
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
Big V bucks

370
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,143
Yes so at the salad bar you have three different kinds of rice

371
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Three big

372
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,727
Shiny silver tabs beautiful silver types of rice

373
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:40,383
We make a lot of money what should we be by

374
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
So there is this

375
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,223
Amazing things that happened at

376
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
Sony Soundbar which is at once a week

377
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,831
Big lobster and salmon

378
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
No

379
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
That one

380
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,207
Expanse did they buy it

381
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
For $20

382
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
The pound

383
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,583
And they sell it in the salad bar for 11:49 a pound

384
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
Alaska

385
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
Like almost half the money you're losing

386
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Weeping 3014

387
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,543
They have a lobster and Dave a lot of group

388
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,407
They're banking on people coming in and getting a little bit of lobster and a lot of rice

389
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,711
So you're saying we should just

390
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,247
Take the salmon envelopes

391
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
I mean

392
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
Tony told me that

393
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
Get the timer

394
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,439
If you can

395
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,743
I would have never thought that

396
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,815
Salad bar was losing money on any single ingredient

397
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:36,703
So the purest form of saving your money at the salad bar is literally just like looking for the thing

398
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,287
That cost the most out that the salad bar and filling up your box

399
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
With only that

400
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,151
Grilled lemon salmon which edit

401
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,759
This is the best deal they told me yeah

402
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,319
Yeah I'll go in right after you

403
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Thank you

404
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,231
That guy may not have been interested in your salad bar tips

405
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
But I am

406
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
Bring it home what else did you learn

407
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,119
I truly thought this is a great tip I loved it

408
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
But

409
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,703
To be fair it was not the real answer that I listen to whistle

410
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,263
So you actually answer the question

411
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
I came back with

412
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
Awesome

413
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,663
This is the ideal salary

414
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Valley-wide yes

415
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
I meant

416
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,247
Okay I am

417
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,343
Seeing a lot of leafy greens

418
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,743
They're basically are a lot of Craisins and like nuts a toppings very expensive office alagar

419
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Working a lot

420
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
Not a lot of veggies

421
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
No water weight

422
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
And I noticed that you

423
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:40,191
You took Tony device there is some salmon in here

424
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:47,871
Gladiator thank you so much for answering Sean's question and thanks for the salad

425
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
It's actually for me

426
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:54,271
Okay goodbye

427
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
Okay next up Darian Woods

428
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,767
Welcome to the studio what is your question that your aunt

429
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,095
Leonardo Plaza Pond listening from Texas ask

430
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,655
Why do Americans refrigerate their eggs

431
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
Nobody around the world does that

432
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
But before we enter

433
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
We asked Deneen how tops

434
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,335
Chef would add some dramatic tension to the segment

435
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
And she told us this

436
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Time

437
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,943
Time is it an easy way to

438
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Kind of

439
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:28,319
Up the ante with things that the oldest trick in the book works every time

440
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
No pun intended

441
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
I think so

442
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
Yeah

443
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
It's not everybody works

444
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
Against the clock that's not a normal

445
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
All right I have my timer here Darren Woods

446
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,375
60 seconds why do Americans refrigerate their eggs

447
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
Go 60 Seconds

448
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
And I'm just starting

449
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,727
Rid of five of those already

450
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
Squandered

451
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,335
Salmonella that is Beyonce

452
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,639
Because if you have a little bit of salmonella in an egg

453
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,967
It's going to grow and grow if you've got variable high temperature

454
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
Refrigerator cake

455
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
What's the temperature lows

456
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,343
Stable and the bacteria doesn't grow as fast

457
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
People get poisoned less frequent

458
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,719
35 European

459
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,303
They don't require as much handling and care with the actual eggs

460
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,447
American egg processors also wash their eggs which is this whole other thing with custom benefits that I kind of get into in 66

461
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,543
Which works better the European vaccination method or the American Refrigeration

462
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,847
Look it's hard to tell but why not do both

463
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
Who was salmonella Ritz

464
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
The terrible disease that kills

465
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
30

466
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,479
Americans a year from egg related salmonella

467
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
You're saying no one to dive song

468
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,319
I would like for there to be no decimal

469
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:38,975
You got 10 seconds left what do you want to say just want to give a shout out to my girlfriend and my family

470
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
And also the beat

471
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
Poultry hotline

472
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
They gave you some

473
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,607
Archie magoulas

474
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,143
He's my good friend now

475
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
There's a timer well done

476
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:54,591
Darien I can't believe you explain that so quickly I'm talking really fast goodbye

477
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,767
Welcome back to the studio thank you

478
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
What is the question that you're going to answer

479
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,655
Okay my question comes from Nate hibore in Hudsonville Michigan

480
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
And he is in a state where they've got the

481
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,823
The $0.10 deposit on the Kansas side of the five cent and he wanted to know if having that higher deposit

482
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Made any difference

483
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Prince anything

484
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,431
Okay and because yours is the last one we're going to make it

485
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Especially hard

486
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
Oh good

487
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,551
Denis told me that sometimes to make good TV

488
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
You got to take people

489
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Where they come

490
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,183
One of the ways is to think about

491
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
The food

492
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
In a different way than its

493
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,071
Known for give us a dish that

494
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
Looks like one thing but tastes like another

495
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
Heath like another

496
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
What would that sound like

497
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
Well

498
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,615
I guess you can have the reporter sing it

499
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,919
What genre

500
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,759
Which country probably would be the best

501
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
You know

502
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
Telling the story

503
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
Keeper emergency

504
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:15,231
Make you kind of uncomfortable you look kind of uncomfortable I mean I literally don't play the guitar

505
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767

506
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
I am I allowed to like bringing help

507
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
Coming up after the break

508
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
Teeth

509
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
Writes a country song

510
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,615
There are roughly 1.9 billion acres of land in the United States

511
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:36,735
The indicator from NPR looks at how that land is divided and what all that has to do with

512
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
A Happy Meal

513
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
Keep your back

514
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,135
You've had a couple days to write a country song about Michigan

515
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
10 cent can redemption rate

516
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207

Tell me one story

523
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,271
Going for it and then I'm going to sing you a different story

524
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
The first story

525
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,976
When I'm just going to tell you starts back in 1976 back then

526
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
Michigan had themselves a problem

527
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
The problem was this

528
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,888
On the shores of Lake Michigan

529
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,752
Well just everywhere empty bottles empty cans

530
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
And the people

531
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:37,920
Rose up and they passed the laws from now on there's going to be a $0.10 deposit on every bottle

532
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,200
And every can

533
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
That's a true story

534
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
It's always this song

535
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,624
It's called The Ballad of the $0.10 man

536
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,024
It's about a man in 2016 who decided I know about some cans

537
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,424
Down in Kentucky where there ain't no tens and deposit to get them I'm going to drive them back to Michigan and

538
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,824
He figured that was a pretty good idea Michigan

539
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,224
Man had a crazy dream aluminum cans got a silver atom

540
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,624
Did Rich perfect plan didn't have a hitch Asia cup get out of Dodge

541
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,024
Cocaine Arbitrage for a thousand bucks drove from Kentucky

542
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,424
Mm candy might get lucky with better than a nickel without Wizards

543
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,824
All Ghana costume is the gas at the time if you're wondering

544
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,224
If Michigan paying $0.10 a can instead of $0.05 a can made a difference will I was well John I can tell you

545
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,624
That it did last year just under 90% of cans in Michigan got returned that's 10

546
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,160
20

547
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:58,816
30% higher than in Nicola can States in 1992 in Michigan

548
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:03,168
100.4 % of cans got return

549
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
And that's hard

550
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
How to do

551
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Yes it is

552
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:12,128
Okay let's get back to the song about our arbitrageur that's a real word by the way

553
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:18,528
Vocabulary by the time you got back it was late God

554
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:24,928
College bait

555
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,328
The last of the perfect plan had just one flaw out-of-state cans were against the law

556
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:37,728
Thousand bucks he drove from Kentucky 10000 cans in my Get Lucky

557
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:44,128
Nichols was always a prison

558
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:50,528
The cop at the trial that the truck was packed with 10000 KN to be

559
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:56,928
Exact the judge said you don't have to go to jail just 1,200 bucks in the mail when the judge

560
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:01,536
