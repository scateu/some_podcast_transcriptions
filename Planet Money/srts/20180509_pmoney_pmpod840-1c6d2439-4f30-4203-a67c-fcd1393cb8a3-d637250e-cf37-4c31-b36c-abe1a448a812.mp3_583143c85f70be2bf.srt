00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,120
So you have a story for us

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,144
And it starts

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,680
With a guy in Georgia

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,472
His name is Artie Shaw

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,312
He worked for the Georgia Department of Agriculture for many years

7
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,848
Mercy love garden

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,736
He wrote a column about it called Artis Garden every once in awhile he would star in a video about Georges

9
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:21,760
The flowers

10
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,576
And these videos they look like they were recorded on

11
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,624
A cell phone standing in a city

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,184
Park parties in his brown suit

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,000
He kind of like reminds me of a guy who'd Maybe

14
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,280
Do your taxes

15
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,816
Maybe like collect the plate of money at

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,472
Even though it's a cloudy day here in Atlanta I feel like I need sunscreen Sandy mix all of these Sunny blossom

17
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,496
Fragrance

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,520
Divine

19
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,152
I have been trying like crazy to reach

20
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
Arty schronce

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,248
Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging

22
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,528
System

23
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,320
Hi this is Dan Charles

24
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,880
From National Public Radio I'd left phone mess

25
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,672
I sent letters

26
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
We never heard back

27
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,536
Honestly considering what he went through I can kind of understand if you wouldn't want to

28
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,560
The journalist

29
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,120
He got in the middle of something way bigger than him

30
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
Here's what happened

31
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,704
4 years artist wants hot this

32
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,240
Really nice job

33
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,544
He answered people's questions about

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,592
Culture in Georgia he talk to Luke

35
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
Gardening group

36
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,176
And then six years ago he moved to a different department

37
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,992
He became director of George's poultry

38
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272
Marketing news

39
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,576
I can chicken

40
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,720
And it's not like a newspaper about chicken it's a Roundup of what is happening in George's chicken

41
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,768
Economy

42
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,560
Copy of it here

43
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
Poultry market news

44
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,936
And this is not an easy read this is you need a PhD

45
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,496
Check the market

46
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Is study to

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
Occasionally week

48
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
To firm live Supply is adequate I don't know what that means the firm and live but there is a part that kind of jumps out of

49
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
Youth in both ears

50
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,272
A list of chicken parts and prices

51
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
So

52
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
Line run tenders are dollars

53
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
69 Holbrook

54
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
$0.92

55
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,976
And these are the official chicken prices for the state of Georgia

56
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,304
Which is important because Georgia is a giant

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,352
In the chicken world it is so big

58
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,680
The University of Georgia even makes inspirational videos about it

59
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
The state of Georgia

60
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,824
Is the number one producer of chicken meat in the United States

61
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
And

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,504
Depending on what year you look at it if you just took the state of Georgia compared to the rest of the world we be the fifth or sixth

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
Largest producer of meat in the entire world

64
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
So there a lot of people

65
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,136
Shrouds

66
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,672
Heat goes from

67
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
Commenting on

68
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
Spring flowers

69
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
To being right in the middle of this huge end

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,096
Annie's publishing prices that

71
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Could affect

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,704
Nottely Georgia but the fortunes of multibillion-dollar come

73
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
Companies like supermarket

74
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
If they use this in

75
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
Fast food joints

76
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
Walmart did

77
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,664
Artie's index help them to figure out what they should pay for

78
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
And then

79
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
About 2 years ago

80
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
Hardee's job

81
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
Became a nightmare

82
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:10,208
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Charles

83
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,608
Play on the show rtt's index goes bad some shadowy Wall Street in

84
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:23,008
Pastors become convinced that chicken companies are charging Americans too much for their chicken and they try to expose

85
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,408
Nrt shrontz gets stuck in the middle

86
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,504

Hey I'm Kelly mcevers from embedded

94
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,704
Bill Spencer works at a coal mine in

95
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
Kentucky

96
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
It when I start asking about

97
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
Future without coal

98
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:02,688
You know what I'm going to say so if I'm done board

99
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,992
Play NPR one app for wherever you get your

100
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
That list of chicken prices at RTP

101
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
This is called the Georgia.

102
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,952
Dock it has been around for 40 years

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,024
To every week already has a job of calling up the

104
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
And we're talking about you.

105
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
The handful of huge company

106
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
Tyson Foods

107
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
Pilgrim's Pride

108
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
Sanderson Farms

109
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,543
He called him up and he says well what are you selling your chicken drumsticks for

110
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
Any compiles those numbers

111
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
He puts out the end.

112
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
No Assurance is not like

113
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,575
The only person in the country doing this the US Department of Agriculture publishes chicken prices some other

114
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
How to companies do it

115
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,695
And the prices on these indexes are usually not too far apart

116
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,255
Couple of years ago

117
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
Things got weird

118
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,839
So take a look at this graph

119
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
So this line is chicken prices

120
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
According to the USDA

121
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,495
And this line is the Georgia doc

122
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
Price Index

123
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
So these are artists

124
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
Okay so I see what's happening

125
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,687
Here I mean basically so the two lines are going along

126
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,735
Pretty similar for many years

127
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,551
And then it looks like late 2015 early twenties

128
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:16,927
15 the USDA numbers would fall off a cliff there yeah they're going down and look at all these numbers

129
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
He just likes

130
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
Stay way up there

131
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,327
Yeah it looks like maybe like 30 even 50% higher than the USDA.

132
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Sing chicken

133
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
Cheap already saying

134
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,239
Chickens expensive of course is a big missed

135
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287
This is the mystery that started this whole

136
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
Because if different

137
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Price in

138
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
Are telling us dip

139
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
Which one is telling the truth

140
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
And why would one of them

141
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
Mby

142
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,295
One of the people who's looking at this graph in

143
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
Scratching his head his lense

144
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,415
Is 1200 miles away from RT he's way up in New Hampshire

145
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,023
And he is a consultant to big companies that buy a lot of

146
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Chicken

147
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
Hundreds of Millions

148
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Sounds of every year

149
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
Like like big

150
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Chain breast

151
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,215
Len looks at this graph and he sends a note to his client

152
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
We work

153
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
Pointing that out

154
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
Georgia Doc is really

155
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,383
Overpriced compared to the USDA

156
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
Call City Market average.

157
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,991
And and did you have a

158
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
Any

159
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
Thoughts on that or no

160
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,087
Explanation for it what did you think was going on

161
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
Sometimes it doesn't matter

162
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,463
What my thoughts are looking

163
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
You just noticed that

164
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
This is not

165
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,863
Moving the way it used to move something has changed here

166
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
One tells his clients

167
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Watch out

168
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Because this

169
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
Could cost you a lot of my

170
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
Here's why

171
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,615
The big restaurants in end in supermarkets

172
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
They want to lock in a supply of chicken for like 5 years

173
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
But they can't lock in a specific

174
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,783
Price so what they do as they write a contract that lets

175
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
The price go up and down

176
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,623
Based on some indicator of the market

177
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
Can we say

178
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,743
Rather than negotiate week-to-week on what the price of chicken should be

179
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
Why don't we

180
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
Just tired of this indicator

181
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,631
That indicator could be Artie's index

182
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
The Georgia poultry market news

183
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
Or I could be another index

184
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,007
And think about what happens

185
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:11,871
When are these prices all of a sudden are way higher than everybody else is if you're paying for chicken

186
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,455
Based on artist prices you're suddenly paying a lot more than you have to

187
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,759
And who's pocketing that extra money

188
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,831
Well it would be the chicken producers

189
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,391
They benefit if chicken prices are higher

190
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,719
And remember Artie's index has chicken prices

191
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
Higher than all the other sodas graph line

192
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Is going far apart

193
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
So what's going on

194
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
We wanted escardi about

195
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,703
Perhaps no tree is as beloved as our native flowering dogwood

196
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
We do know this

197
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
The federal government got a

198
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,895
A tip that there was something fishy going on with this Georgia price

199
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,527
So the US Department of Agriculture the USDA sent three of its people down to Georgia

200
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,111
To talk to Arty schronce to watch how he compiled is index

201
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
And after that visit

202
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
For some

203
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
Do USDA decides to

204
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Stop

205
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
Posting Artie's index

206
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
On the USDA website

207
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
It was a hint

208
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
Do anyone paying really close attention that maybe this index the Georgia doc those numbers

209
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
You're off

210
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
And

211
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,383
You know who can smell a bad price from a thousand miles away

212
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
Wall Street

213
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,991
I had come across investors

214
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
They work sort of

215
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,319
Talking about it freely but they were talking

216
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
This is Stephanie strong

217
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,023
I'm a former journalist from The New York Times and I covered the food business for many years around this time

218
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
Stephanie Strom was getting

219
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Tips about chicken

220
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
From some Wall Street

221
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Contacts investors

222
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
There

223
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,471
The New York watching the markets like to do

224
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
And

225
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,799
They see something that they think is going to be a big

226
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
Eggslut

227
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
Of chicken

228
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
You had a huge

229
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
Oversupply of chicken

230
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
More chicken than they believed

231
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,623
People would eat and so they were betting that the price of chicken was going to fall

232
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,719
Yeah they were betting that the price of chicken was going to fall in that poultry producers are going to be losing

233
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
Right

234
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,559
Overvalue they thought the stock

235
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
And so

236
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
They shorted the stock

237
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:16,031
These Wall Street investors will make a ton of money if there's chicken company stocks ball

238
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
So they're just

239
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,919
Sitting there New York waiting for the oversupply of chickens hit the market which they think

240
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,735
Going to cause prices to collapse and yet

241
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
When you went to the grocery store

242
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
The price of chicken was

243
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
Either stable or even going up slightly

244
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
Which was probably driving

245
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
These guys crazy

246
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
Either this is not my world

247
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:41,375
I don't know what these guys are like you talked about in the hedge-fund guys is there a type

248
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,423
They tend to

249
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
B

250
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
Very confident

251
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,335
And very confident in their investment decisions

252
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,455
And when they don't go the way that they think they're going to

253
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
They work

254
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
Very hard to

255
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
Figure out why their thesis

256
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
Because there's always a thesis

257
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
The investment

258
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,391
Didn't go that way

259
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
And

260
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
Then

261
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:11,583
To persuade you the reporter that they were always right and that whatever these other factors are

262
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
Really don't matter

263
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,447
Or other people are stupid is what usually it comes down to

264
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
And I'm assuming these are mostly guys

265
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,823
They in this case everyone was

266
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
Yes

267
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
So do you

268
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
Very confident hedge fund

269
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
Dudes are

270
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,551
Trying to figure out why a prices of chicken in supermarkets are not

271
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,415
And they start looking really hard at how those prices are set

272
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
And they realize

273
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
A lot of them are linked

274
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
To Artis

275
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Index

276
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
So maybe that's the answer

277
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,399
So they go to Stephanie Strom and they tell her about

278
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:52,799
Now she is a little weary because Wall Street is always trying to get reporters to write stuff so that Wall Street

279
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
But then Stephanie

280
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,967
Here's just by accident that the USDA also had some problems

281
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Hardee's in.

282
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:06,623
I was probably having lunch with somebody about something completely unrelated all the other you know the USDA looked in

283
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,183
That was when I decided it was

284
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
What's the story

285
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
Because

286
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,303
It wasn't just a bunch of guys trying to make money off of

287
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Betrayed

288
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:19,935
It was a government Regulators that also had that exact same question

289
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
It's about this

290
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Pricing in the

291
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
And possibly

292
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,335
This index might be taking money out of the pockets of

293
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,687
Chicken eaters Across America renew need chicken fingers to survive

294
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
BBQ hours

295
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,783
Throwing Chicken on their barbecued is the most

296
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
Popular meat

297
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
That was why it was a good story

298
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Because

299
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
If

300
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
Mrs. Smith

301
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
Is paying more for chicken

302
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
Then she really should be

303
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Just to keep

304
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
You know the executives

305
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
The chicken come

306
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
I need that nappy right

307
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
Then that's of Interest

308
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,007
So she writes her story the headline is

309
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,567
You might be paying too much for your chicken

310
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
He gets a lot of attention

311
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
But nothing like what happens next

312
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
The chicken bombs

313
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
Memo

314
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
Gilliam MO

315
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,343
And we should tell you that for the story we are relying on a lot of.

316
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Big pilot.

317
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
Memo's included and

318
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,975
Those documents there was a lawyer at

319
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Private firm

320
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,815
Who understand from government agencies use

321
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Open records laws

322
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,679
He won't tell us who he was working for it but there are clues that point toward hedge funds

323
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,799
So one day in November 6 in the afternoon this lawyer gets a new

324
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
Released by the Georgia Department of Agri

325
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
A memo from Artie shrunk

326
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
It wasn't a dress

327
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
To anybody

328
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
At the top it just says

329
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
Notes for meeting

330
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
We don't know if there was actually me

331
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
Can we don't have any comment from RT unfortunately

332
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Stop flower tape

333
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:49,023
This memo is 3 pages of Artie schronces doubts about his own work

334
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,839
He says he was thrown into the job with no training

335
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:57,727
When he calls chicken companies and asked for their prices they're not really taking him seriously they're like and put down whatever you did last

336
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,055
And it seems from the member of the Arty feels personally

337
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Play Hurt by this

338
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,407
But most importantly he says he does not believe what the company

339
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,431
These are telling him

340
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,735
Or Patty put it in this memo he has

341
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,575
Come to question the validity of some of the information provided

342
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,879
He does not trust his own index

343
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,951
You see the way the Georgia doc was set up

344
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,255
The companies just tell him a price

345
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,095
Artis not asking for invoices to actually verify that the sales

346
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
What happened at that

347
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,679
And up till now nobody thought that was necessary

348
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
And then already

349
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Quiet Rd

350
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Lover of gardens

351
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
He says

352
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,591
Just blow this thing up

353
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,175
The state of Georgia should not be putting this index together he says

354
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,575
Get rid of it entirely or maybe transfer to a private company let them take responsibility for it basically this schronce memo

355
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
As people started calling it

356
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,927
Confirmed what the hedge funds had thought was happening

357
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231
That the poultry companies were making up price

358
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
Isis and manipulating the Gorge

359
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,423
Chicken price-fixing confirmed from the inside the big deal and within a day that memo is in

360
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,471
In the hands of a reporter from The Washington Post

361
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
And when the post publishes it

362
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
The stocks

363
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Companies like

364
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,847
Mike Tyson Sanderson Farms

365
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:11,711
The drop immediately it by about 5% that is billions of dollars in Lost

366
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,503
Or profits if you're short selling

367
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,319
This was really the end of Artis Indo

368
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,391
Within a month the Georgia Depart of agriculture

369
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
Decides not to publish it anymore

370
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,743
Now they did try to replace it with a new price

371
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
A better one

372
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,887
With prices that were not just reported by poultry companies that also verified by checking in

373
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
With their customer

374
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,983
The people setting up this new price index

375
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,311
Better one arranged a conference call to introduce

376
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
Only one chicken producer

377
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Cirkled in

378
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,599
But there were half a dozen people from Wall Street and they

379
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623
Really piled on

380
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
My question is

381
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,815
I mention contract prices only

382
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
Point72 Asset Management

383
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Earlier

384
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
How many chicken companies

385
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,359
My name is Noah Gillespie

386
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
New York

387
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,967
Noah Gillespie is actually the attorney who filed all those

388
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Request for DACA

389
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
Give us the documents we've been relying on

390
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
The government's internal emails about

391
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
Go to Georgia. Also the Arty shrine

392
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Launch memo

393
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:28,767
And he empties other Wall Street guys they have a lot of skeptical questions about whether the

394
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
This new price index is going to be honest

395
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
After that confer

396
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
Call a bunch of a poultry producers

397
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Decided

398
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,495
They didn't even want to participate anymore

399
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
They never submitted any price

400
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
Said to this new index

401
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
It never launched

402
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,455
So six months after the USDA first sent people down to look at RT schronce

403
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,015
What is working figure out what he was doing with his poultry price

404
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
The index is gone

405
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,855
In the state of Georgia is out of the price index

406
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Remember

407
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,719
The Headstone Guys thought that if the Georgia doc went away

408
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Poultry prices

409
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,839
But they don't and that is the mystery That Remains

410
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
And are two theories that took

411
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
Wonder is

412
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,775
Big supermarkets had just been ignoring Artie's index

413
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,359
Once it got weird they were negotiating a more reasonable prices on their own

414
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
But that's what happened

415
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
Maybe nobody got hurt

416
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
But there are other people who say

417
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,551
Know that handful of big companies that controls the chicken business

418
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,623
They were fixing prices in fact they still are

419
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,743
A bunch of the big chicken buyers like supermarkets are suing all those big poultry

420
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:37,887
Accusing them of propping up prices in all sorts of ways not just feeding fake prices to Artesia

421
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,703
The boelter companies say they've done nothing of

422
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,495
The sort that case could take years

423
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,031
Letrozole for there's a bigger point

424
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
Everywhere you look in the economy

425
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,919
People rely on indicators like Hardee's chicken

426
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,503
Their list of prices people are paying for things like green

427
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Housing

428
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,855
I never really thought about where those numbers come from

429
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,415
Sometimes those numbers are really solid like

430
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
The stock market those

431
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Zhengzhou open

432
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:07,839
See or if you're in the beef or pork business there's actually a legal requirement that you have to report how much

433
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
But in other Industries

434
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,983
It's just private companies making private deals

435
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,591
And if you're trying to figure out what are they actually paying what is that

436
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
Thing worth

437
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
It takes some serious

438
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
Detective work

439
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,711
Sometimes it takes a guy

440
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
Sitting in his office in Georgia

441
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,575
Making calls to big companies who could

442
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
Could tell him any price they want

443
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:38,815
Arty schronce is now retired from the Georgia Department of Agriculture nobody celebrates him as a whistle

444
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
Hopefully somewhere

445
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,263
Is peacefully 10 Garden considered

446
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,823

Dammit

468
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,223
Why is it called the Georgia.

469
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,599
Well actually nobody knows I asked the Georgia Department of Agriculture this by the way

470
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
It's doc

471
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,439
Play Ock not documents

472
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,839
But doc like water or dock where your ship comes in I have no idea I asked them and they said they don't know either it's been around for so long

473
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Nobody knows which

474
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Huh
