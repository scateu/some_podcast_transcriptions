Quick morning there is some profanity in this episode

12
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,552
Hey it's Stacey Vanek Smith

00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,856
Today Show originally aired in 2016

14
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,880
Dean it is about

15
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:27,648
CEO pay

16
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
Are we going to watch new really interesting information about CEO pay because of this rule put in place as part of the.

17
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,352
Frank Lott which is the big 2010 banking right

18
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
Regulation Lop it was

19
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,168
Financial crisis

20
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,192
Enrollment

21
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
Did this year

22
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,240
Some big companies

23
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:46,848
Had to report their pay ratios basically comparing how much money CEOs make

24
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,384
How much the median worker at

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
At the company make

26
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,200
And those numbers show

27
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968
Surprise

28
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,504
Did CEOs get paid

29
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,552
Way more than other workers do

30
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:00,672
The New York Times calculated that an employee at Walmart making the company's median salary

31
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,744
Would have to work for more than a thousand years

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,048
To make as much money as Walmart CEO got in

33
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
2007

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,888
So here's our episode looking at how we got here

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Cheers the show

36
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,704
This is the other day

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,496
I was looking at this chart

38
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,776
I brought it into the studio

39
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
The chart is

40
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,152
Average pay for CEOs at Big us corporations over the past several deck

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,456
And I saw something really surprising

42
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,576
I'd always assumed you know that co-pay just goes up and up and up a kind of steady way year after year

43
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
But what this chart

44
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
Clearly shows is in fact there is this one moment I can put my finger on it here it's right in the mid 1990

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
Weird CEO Pago's

46
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Banana

47
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,656
Right before then it's kind of engine along and then just

48
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,704
All of a sudden midnight

49
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Straight up

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,360
But you don't when I say Goes Bananas I don't even mean that in like a value judgment kind of way I just mean

51
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,920
Whatever you think about CEO pay

52
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,968
Anybody would look at this chart

53
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016
Point of this moment in history and say

54
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,672
What happens right here hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

55
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:11,072

People often think annuities are too conservative to complex or only for retirees but annuities can

58
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,624

You got one week to fix the country's failing preschools

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,272
Go on rough translation of bold experiment by a country to transform its culture teaching

65
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,880
It works until the very people that most want the school to succeed

66
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
Start getting in the way

67
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
Rough translation

68
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
Wherever you get your podcasts

69
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,936
The story of this moment when co-pay started going up really fast

70
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,264
Among other things it's like a story of unintended

71
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,104
And it starts or at least we're going to start it a few years

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,176
Before things go bananas 1990

73
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,968
There was this economist named

74
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Kevin Murphy

75
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,088
And he was looking at this and he wasn't so much concerned with how much CEOs

76
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
We're getting paid

77
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
As he was with

78
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
How they were getting paid

79
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,744
He thought a lot of CEOs were getting paid a lot of money

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Basically just sit around

81
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
The biggest sole determinant of your compensation was

82
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
How big of company you were running

83
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
And it was a

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,984
Turned out to be just a lousy way to do business

85
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
If the CEO had a great year

86
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
They got paid

87
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
See you had a terrible year

88
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
Also got paid

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Didn't really matter

90
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
Who is result Murphy says

91
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,992
There was a tendency for CEOs to just kind of be on autopilot

92
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,296
Go to work pay, nice big paycheck

93
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,856
Murphy co-wrote this really influence

94
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
Paper or he basically argued

95
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
That the way CEOs were being paid

96
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Was wrong

97
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,280
CEO pay he said should be based on performance

98
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
If the company does well the CEO should get more

99
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
Company doesn't do so well

100
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,167
CEOs should get less

101
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
The really logical idea

102
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,007
And you wrote the paper at just the right time

103
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,335
Fruit to get a lot of attention the US was going through a recession

104
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,383
Not not a major recession but

105
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
Recession where

106
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,223
Executives for getting rich

107
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,039
At the same time they were laying off their employees

108
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
And of course

109
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
Is it that's a minefield

110
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,951
It's a Minefield if you're a CEO making millions of dollars a year

111
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,303
But if you are paid a young Governor running for president this is a gif

112
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,679
If companies want to overpay their executive they shouldn't get any special treatment from Uncle Sam

113
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,983
Oh I know that boy

114
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
Young Bill Clinton and listen here because this is not just

115
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
One more sort of abstract

116
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
Campaign rant about co-pay

117
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
Clint here is making an actual policy proposed

118
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:36,895
Bill Clinton spoiler alert wins the election end in 1993 decides

119
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,967
He's going to make good on that campaign promise and change that

120
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
Here is how the tax code works

121
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
If your company

122
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
To figure out how much income you have to

123
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,903
Taxes on you to take all the money you make

124
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
And then subtract Yorick

125
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,487
If you rent Office Space.

126
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
That you buy bunch of

127
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Computers

128
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
You can subtract that

129
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
And all of the money you pay your

130
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Please

131
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
Including CEO

132
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
You can subtract that too

133
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
It's an expense like anything else

134
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,079
And with the help of Congress Clinton made a little change to the tech

135
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,895
He put a limit on how much CEO pay

136
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
Companies could subtract

137
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
You limited how much they could do.

138
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
That limit

139
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
$1000000

140
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,111
So if you pay your CEO $1000000

141
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
You can deduct that

142
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
But if you pay them

143
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,023
2 million dollars were $5 or $10 you can only deduct

144
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
The first milk

145
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,863
It was a notch for the federal government to pay CEOs less

146
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,167
There was also a second nut

147
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
In this new part of the

148
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,031
And this one was tied to the idea that that economist

149
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Kevin Murphy

150
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
I've been pushing

151
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,639
Yeah yeah that CEO should be paid for performance

152
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
That needed him to the tax code

153
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
Specifically it is in subparagraph

154
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
4C

155
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,831
Perhaps the most important subparagraph in history of

156
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
Taxes

157
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Endo case

158
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
CEO pay

159
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,023
And that's a paragraph says this million-dollar cap

160
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Does not

161
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Apply to pay

162
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
It is tied

163
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
Performance

164
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,167
Tell tell the government here is like paste

165
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:09,567
You want to keep paying those multimillion-dollar salaries for CEOs just showing up in collecting a paycheck

166
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
Hospital

167
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,431
But you want to try out this new idea this pay-for-performance thing

168
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,015
We like that as long as the pay is clearly tied to Performance

169
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,855
There is no limit no matter how much you pay you can deduct it all

170
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:27,999
Bill white remembers when the tax law change the time with the CEO of a company called Bell & Howell

171
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
And served on various Boards of directors

172
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,607
The law that created this this rule

173
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
Was that a big deal

174
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,239
You know what the time it probably didn't look like it but in retrospect it was huge

175
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
Yuge

176
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
Yuge

177
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,847
Who is huge because it changed the way that needle

178
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,663
Compensator top executives

179
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Bill says

180
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,991
Compensation committees the part of the board that says

181
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
The pay for the

182
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,831
Yo looked at this new tax code and said

183
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Okay

184
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
What style are CEOs paid a performance

185
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,951
The compensation committee Square aisuru

186
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Immediately

187
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511
Started thinking about

188
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,071
How we will change the pieces

189
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
Troy top executive truck CEO

190
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,191
And the obvious way to move

191
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,239
Wish it was to move to stock options

192
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Because of that law

193
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Spock

194
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Options

195
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,967
Stock option gives you as the name suggests the option to buy a share of stock

196
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,319
Little quasi real world example Stacy what state

197
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
You get promoted to the CEO of

198
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
Planet Money worldwide owner

199
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Oh and your boss

200
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
You're my boss

201
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,071
Are stock right now is trading at say $10

202
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
KS part of your pay

203
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,167
I'm going to give you one stock up

204
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Just one

205
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,751
And this gives you the right to buy

206
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
1 share

207
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,847
A Planet Money stock for $10 at some point in the future

208
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
Okay

209
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
So now

210
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
Let's say you're doing your job

211
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
Great

212
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
Stock in Planet Money Enterprises goes up

213
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,831
It goes up from $10 this year to $15

214
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
Do I want to cash out how do I cash out

215
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
You can so what you doing

216
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,231
You use your option to exercise your right to

217
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,047
To buy a share of Planet Money stock for $10

218
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,631
And then you turn around and sell it for the market price sell it for $15

219
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
You get the pocket

220
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
$5

221
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,007
Which in Midtown Manhattan will buy me

222
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Hakkasan

223
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
I want a raise

224
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,711
Okay so that is the good case scenario that's if things go well right

225
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
Can you do a terrible job

226
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
Paseo Pointe

227
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
Nothing to it but say you do

228
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
So you want to 10 part series on the

229
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
On the history of the penny

230
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
AR stock goes down

231
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
2 $8

232
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,327
Now that stock option at 10 it is not going to do anything for

233
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
We've effectively

234
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,935
Tiger pay to the performance of Planet Money Enterprises

235
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
I like this Penny ID

236
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
All right

237
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Anyways

238
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,383
This paper performance idea it seems

239
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Sensible enough

240
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,479
Kevin Murphy The Economist who been pushing me idea

241
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
His Hope was

242
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,807
Companies with pay CEOs more with option

243
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
And less

244
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Through base pay

245
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
And after that law passed

246
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
Companies did pay more with option

247
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,719
But that other part

248
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,279
The cutting the base pay part

249
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
That's not going to happen

250
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
This is Bill White

251
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
The former CEO and board member

252
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
It's a very nice concept

253
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,591
But if you are Nadia if your CEO you're not going to want that to happen and if you're on the board of director

254
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
You have a good day

255
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:28,479
The last thing you're going to do is go to them and say you know it was going to take away from your base cop

256
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,575
That the rising payments through options this was not like this

257
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Just happening at

258
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
One company here in another day

259
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
What's happening at Lots

260
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
And lots of

261
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,767
Dumbbells with a compensation consultant at the time

262
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,815
And before options payments to

263
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,351
CEO has been growing at a cup

264
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Couple percentage

265
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,935
After Bill Clinton signed that tax law

266
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Exploded

267
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
He remembers looking at this one survey in the mid-90s

268
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
We looked at the survey

269
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
And said

270
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
Oh my gosh so I got

271
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Gone off

272
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
By 40%

273
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
And we're caught

274
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
And

275
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Must be wrong

276
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,183
So you're saying you actually looked at this number you thought know this must be a

277
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
Hyperwear somebody must have made a math

278
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
Bright

279
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,839
Right now this is not this must be in the steak

280
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
It wasn't a mistake

281
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,191
Between 1992 and 1996

282
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:25,055
Average pay for CEOs at 500 of the biggest US corporations

283
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
Roughly doubled

284
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
From $4000000

285
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
28 million

286
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,735
This is that moment on the chart where CEO pay takes off or

287
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,759
When it starts today

288
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:38,623
Take off after this it just keep going up and up and up and that happens for a few reasons

289
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
The first one is

290
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,767
Kind of surprising a lot of companies are giving their CEOs a set number of option

291
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
As part of their pay every year

292
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,143
Tech company gives a CEO a hundred options as part of their pay in

293
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
Tape 1990

294
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:57,567
6 in 1997 there's a good chance that that company is going to give the CEO another hundred options as part of their

295
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Their pay package for that

296
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
Which Bureau seems reasonable out of

297
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,967
But the stock market at the time was going up

298
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,807
Higher the market. The more of those options were were

299
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,391
Didn't that the value of the pay packages of a lot of CEOs was

300
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,463
It was essentially automatically increasing every year

301
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,047
But there's a second reason that CEO pay took off around

302
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Way more interest

303
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
I learned it eventually doing the reporting for

304
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,959
Yes everybody you know why around this time

305
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,519
What company is giving out so many

306
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,823
And they all mentioned this thing

307
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,383
That really seems to come down to five

308
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
We thought they were free

309
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
We

310
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,759
Thought they were free

311
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
V words

312
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,879
This is Barbara Franklin she is served on corporate boards for decades

313
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:48,767
She went to Harvard Business School she's also a former Secretary of Commerce for the United States of America

314
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
And she told me what a lot of people

315
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,399
Back in the 90s almost everybody thought options were free

316
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:59,007
We thought they were free that was the bottom line did you really think they were free

317
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,591
Sure we did

318
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
The idea that options were free

319
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,455
Had nothing to do with that tax law passed under Bill Clinton

320
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,039
It has to do with an accounting rule that had been in place for decades

321
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,879
Under that accounting rule when companies issue their financial statements

322
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,439
They didn't have to account for stock options

323
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
The way they had to account for other kinds of

324
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,327
The under that accounting rule options kind of worth

325
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,167
You can sort of see why I like think about it like this

326
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
If your company

327
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
Can you pay someone a salary you write him a check

328
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
You are giving them

329
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
That is

330
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
Obviously not

331
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
What is stock option

332
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:40,735
I mean stock option I don't have to take any money out of the company bank account to give it to

333
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,087
And if you decide to use it in the Future II to buy that chair stock

334
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
I can just

335
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
Create a new stock for you

336
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
Out of thin air that also doesn't cost us anything

337
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,255
Of course the truth is that does cost

338
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
Stock options are not free

339
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,095
Someone in the pain

340
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Specifically

341
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
Every other person who owns stock in the company

342
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,983
Every time a new share is created

343
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
All of the existing shares of stock

344
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
Are worth a little less

345
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
So say you have a retirement fund

346
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
Some of your retirement funds

347
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
In stock

348
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,247
This extra pay for the CEO these options they are coming from you

349
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,623
Don delves the compensation Consultants City kept trying to explain this to people at the time

350
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
First of all we built this

351
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,719
Shirley Lambert model of trailer to show people

352
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
Look this is what's happening

353
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
You know your

354
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,095
Hurting your shareholders you're hurting the value of the company

355
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,655
United States located

356
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
Nah

357
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
We don't need that

358
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
They're really free

359
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
The options are

360
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,335
He finally found one company that was willing to listen

361
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,151
That really wanted to understand what was going on

362
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
We took him and threw it in detail

363
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,271
Look this is what your stock options are

364
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,087
Costing you this is what they're costing or shareholder

365
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,903
I know you know they eat they understood at

366
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,767
They understood it then we even got to the end and the meeting and they said

367
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Sidwell

368
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Thank you

369
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,423
But we're still going to go hide and Grant the options

370
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,471
They said they had to do it

371
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
Because everybody else was doing

372
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,335
Once options took off like this in the 90s

373
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
The group that sets the accounting rules for us come

374
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:19,039
Looked at that old rule that made options feel free and they said oh obviously this is wrong

375
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
We're going to change the

376
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,647
So that companies cannot keep pretending that options are

377
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,695
Companies went ballistic

378
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
Here is a local news broadcast from 1990

379
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
Before becoming a protest

380
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
In San Jose

381
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,703
Get the marching band doesn't get your attention maybe the song

382
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Find will

383
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,775
A couple of thousand Silicon Valley workers

384
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:45,663
Are fighting mad about losing their stock options because of the fasb or Faz B

385
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:50,527
Is the Financial Accounting Standards Board that group that wants to change the world

386
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
And all these people are coming out to protest

387
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:57,183
That's because stock options were not just been given out to CEOs and executives

388
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Especially

389
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,023
They were being given out to lots and lots of

390
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,607
And in this new spot you see people marching with signs

391
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
What's the safe

392
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
Stock options equal job

393
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
You see people

394
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
Wendy's red buttons

395
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
It's in the shape of stop sign

396
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
Say stop fast

397
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
And they did stop fast

398
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
There were enough protest and a nap

399
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
Pressure The Fez be back

400
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
Options were still

401
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Treated as free

402
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
And CEOs

403
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
Kept getting more of them

404
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
Co-pay kept going up

405
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:30,207
Yeah I asked Don Dells the compensation consultant what it was like to be doing his job

406
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
At this moment

407
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
How are you feeling at this point

408
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
Like you're in the middle of

409
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
Bright

410
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
How do you feel doing a job in the

411
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Late 90s

412
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
That's a very good question

413
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
Jacob Plumbing

414
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
Think about that for a second

415
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Uncomfortable

416
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
Very

417
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,183
Did you feel like because of the job you had you were

418
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
Contributing to this problem

419
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Death

420
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
Absolutely

421
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
Absolutely in Italian

422
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
Crazy Crepe

423
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
Concern

424
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:15,263
Kevin Murphy The Economist would argue that CEOs should get more options

425
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
Also wasn't feeling so great

426
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,639
He says he felt like a doctor who recommends a glass of wine every night

427
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,711
And suddenly companies are giving their CEOs and their workers

428
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
A bottle of wine

429
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
And saying

430
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
Drink up it's good for you

431
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
I started being worried about

432
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,927
Watch watching in real-time the the largest

433
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,791
Transfer of wealth from shareholders to workers that we'd ever seen in Corporate America

434
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:43,679
Average pay for CEOs at Big corporations which has been at four million dollars in 1992

435
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,007
19 million dollars in the year 2000

436
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
Is it almost Queen toppled in less than a decade

437
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
And then

438
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Stop going

439
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967

Hate this guy right here host of how I built this

448
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
In our latest episode

449
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
Chip Wilson turned workout clothes

450
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
Into a fashion statement

451
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
And along the way

452
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,719
Build a breakout brand Lululemon

453
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Now worth

454
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Jillian

455
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,327
You can listen to how I built this on Apple podcast

456
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
Or however you get your pocket

457
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,191
Eventually CEO pay did start to come

458
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
And this happened for a bunch of

459
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,823
The.com bubble popped the whole stock market plunged

460
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,127
And shareholders finally started noticing

461
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,175
Caring about all those stock option

462
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
Companies working

463
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Something hey

464
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,503
That's our money you're giving

465
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:08,159
Suddenly Boards of directors World lot more interested in what Don delves that compensation consultant had to say

466
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,463
He remembers this one call he got around this

467
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
Time from a board of directors

468
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,327
It was starting to worry about how much they've been paying their top executives

469
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
Nicki Minaj

470
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,263
Can you show us a little bit about everything is whining like a five-page report we gave him a hundred picture for it

471
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,847
And we started calling it that the holy s*** moments

472
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,479
They kept sucking the pages and each one of you are holy s***

473
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,783
Going to go

474
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
Oh holy s***

475
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
Meaning what

476
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,207
Meaning they didn't realize how

477
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
Obviously overpaid

478
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
The executive team

479
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
And how it is gotten out of

480
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Control

481
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,239
That board Roundup cutting it

482
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
CEOs pay in

483
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,895
Also fast beat the accounting rules people finally had the support for what they wanted to

484
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,991
They changed that accounting rules so companies could no longer

485
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
Street stock options

486
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,599
The most surprising thing to me in this whole story

487
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,903
Happens now right around this time

488
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
CEO pay

489
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
Goes down

490
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,815
Which I never would have guessed it just goes up and up and up forever but no

491
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
When you look at

492
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,703
The average pay of the CEOs of the biggest US corporations

493
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
From 19 million dollars in 2000

494
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,823
212 million dollars in 2014

495
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,407
The end of all the interviews I did for the story I asked everybody the same

496
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Question

497
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,991
How do you feel about how much CEOs are paid

498
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,343
Some said well it depends on the CEO you know these people are running

499
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
Corporations that are worth

500
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
Billions of dollars

501
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,463
Tell somebody you can make that company a little bit better

502
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
It's worth a lot of money

503
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
Tio today still over

504
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,399
And to be clear CEO pay has gone down

505
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,447
But not nearly as much as it went up

506
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
CEO pay today

507
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,543
Is still much much higher than it was

508
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,943
Back in the early nineties

509
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:13,343
Quit the numbers we use in the story for co-pay they are adjusted for inflation they are in mm

510
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,744
$14 they are based on CEOs of companies that are in the S&P 500 and they come from Kevin

511
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,584
The Economist we talked to in the story who is now a professor at USC

512
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,984
Sandals the compensation consultant in the story he is still a compensation consultant he works at a firm called
