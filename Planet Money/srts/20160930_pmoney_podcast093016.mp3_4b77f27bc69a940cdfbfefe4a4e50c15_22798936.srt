Play Planet Money this is Cameron

00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,312
In San Diego

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,384
I've always heard that money can't buy happy

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:17,920
But

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Is there an income or wealth points

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,552
Where life satisfaction or depression changes

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,344
End of message

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,928
Jasmine gars

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,048
You and I are standing outside of an ATM in a bank in Midtown Manhattan

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,328
And at what are we doing

12
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,912
We're looking through the trash

13
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,240
We're digging through people's old ATM receipt

14
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,848
Because today on the show we are testing out an economic theory which says

15
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,128
My happiness

16
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,944
Depends not just on how much money I have

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,272
But it is also contingent on how much money other people have

18
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,040
So

19
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:01,440
At the moment I have about $1,500 in checking so we're here going through the trash to see how much money other people have

20
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,744
And how that makes us feel

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
I'm doing with surreptitiously because there is a security guard watching us I'm pulling up

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,032
I'm pulling out a handful of receipt Elga I think it's a piece of pork

23
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,872
Okay this person

24
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:25,504
This person has $250 in checking does that make you happier

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,904
No that doesn't make me happy or happy I do what we're looking for here is $0.01 in there

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,768
Count that does not make me feel happy at all

27
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,584
$5,000 okay

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,888
5035.

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,936
I feel like that's attainable

30
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,008
I don't feel like that makes me feel like

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
It makes me feel a little bad

32
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
It's checking

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Oh

34
00:01:54,176 --> 00:02:00,320
20 * 20291 and 4 cents in checking to

35
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,904
The exact does that make you unhappy it makes me feel like

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
I need to get my life in order you do need to listen to Lady

37
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:15,936
Hello and welcome to Planet Money on Noel King

38
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
And I'm Jasmine cars

39
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
Today on the show

40
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
Wait

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
What

42
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:26,432
And also why we asked you to send us questions about the economy that perplex and confuse

43
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,712
Use and frustrate you

44
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:32,064
And today on the show we will be answering some of those including the question Jasmine

45
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,160
Does more money make you happier and if it does

46
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:45,120

Okay Jazz we have five questions on the show today

56
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
And the first one is

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
Can money buy happy

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
The simple answer is

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,376
Just like you and I probably don't quite agree on that

60
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
Neither do a lot of economist

61
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
But some have tried to answer it

62
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
We spoke to two of them

63
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
And we told them make your bed

64
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,640
The first Economist we spoke to is David blanchflower he works at Dartmouth

65
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,456
She studied the intersection of money and happy

66
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
So we asked in the first question

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
Does money buy happiness

68
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
And he said

69
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
Yes data shows it does

70
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,696
In fact the wealthier you get the happier you tend to be

71
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:48,096
And remember what we were doing at the top of the show how we were dipping our entire arms into ATM trash

72
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Cancel

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,728
We were just doing that because we love sifting through garbage we were doing that because we were

74
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Testing

75
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
David blanchflower Theory which is that our happiness

76
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
Depends not just on how much we have

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
But how much others

78
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
Relative things

79
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:09,344
So people get themselves a new BMW which is fine if nobody else

80
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
But if everybody else gets

81
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,720
The new one then people compare themselves to others

82
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:19,327
And relative happiness actually doesn't change so basically we're a bunch of haters

83
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,727
Please put me a pair to compare ourselves to others

84
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Hello

85
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,055
But here we have an area of disagreement

86
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,383
Justin wolfers is an economist at the University of Michigan

87
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,735
And he told us he is very skeptical about the role of relativity

88
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
What really mattered

89
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
The people's well-being

90
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,391
With your income relative to other people I got a great proposition

91
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
You should leave New York

92
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
And go to Mexico

93
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,535
It was a small rural Mexican Village

94
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,095
Will you be easily the richest person in town

95
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,703
What matters is being rich really for the people that would make you and want to see happy

96
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
Do you think Jazz you'd be happier in a

97
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
Small Mexican Village

98
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
In fact

99
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
I would

100
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,383
I often fantasize

101
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,431
Moving to a small Mexican deli

102
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
But I don't think it would be about

103
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
Being richer

104
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Then everyone

105
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
Yeah

106
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,367
Now here's a second big question that economist look at

107
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,487
Is there a point at which getting more money just doesn't make you any more happy

108
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
Which is there a limit

109
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
Here's David blanchflower again

110
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,655
Well it's certainly true that money can buy happiness

111
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
It's absolutely true

112
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,263
People with higher incomes are happier

113
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,079
But I actually as income Rises

114
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
What is the extra amount of happiness

115
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
35 fools

116
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:43,295
A famous quote that I've used it sucks is that supposed Arnold Schwarzenegger quote which says

117
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,367
My Syracuse million didn't make me as happy as my first

118
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:53,279
May 30th million didn't make me as happy as my first good quote it's a really good quote but is it true

119
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
Again Justin wolfers

120
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Very skeptic

121
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,655
This is all very interesting

122
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
Asking social scientist about it

123
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Is pointless

124
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,615
Social scientists don't know anything about what's going on among the ultra Ultra Ultra rich

125
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,663
Really why not

126
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,991
Well if you can get Arnold Schwarzenegger in Warren Buffett

127
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,087
Bill Gates to fill out survey forms for me all day tomorrow then we will have data

128
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,183
This like a full-on beef

129
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,047
It turns out not a lot of millionaires and billionaires answer a survey question

130
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
Since about money and happiness

131
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,167
They are too busy diving into their pools of money

132
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
Are the sinner Cameron

133
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
Something else too

134
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
Is there an amount at which

135
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
We become happy

136
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
The answer is

137
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,151
No we just we don't have an answer

138
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
There's not a number

139
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,759
Here's what we think you can take away

140
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:52,159
If you are making $50,000 a year you are probably happier than somebody making $25,000 a year

141
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,975
Someone making $100,000 a year

142
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,767
Probably happier than you

143
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
You're welcome

144
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
Jasmine thank you so much

145
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,703
And just this is your last show with us for a while

146
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,799
For a while I'm going off to report for a show called the world if so

147
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Co-production

148
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
PRI and the BBC

149
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,407
Well we're going to miss you alot I'm going to miss you guys

150
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Hi

151
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,759
This is Christopher test

152
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,063
And my question for the Planet Money

153
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,903
Is where did the idea that the FED should Target

154
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
2%

155
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
Inflation come from

156
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
Is there actual academic research

157
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,095
Suggest at 2% is better than 3% or 1%

158
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Thanks

159
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,983
Okay so the question is

160
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
Where does the feds

161
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,079
Inflation Target of 2% come from

162
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,407
And Jacob Goldstein is here with an answer

163
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,063
Hell yes I have an answer I was very excited that we got a few questions with the light at the

164
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
Okay but before we get to the answer

165
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
Just do some fed 101

166
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:03,071
Okay it's been a long time since we didn't have to do it like every week is okay the FED is the Federal Reserve

167
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,679
The people who have the power to set interest rates in our country

168
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
This is a big Power

169
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
Right and it basically works like this

170
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
When the FED wants there to

171
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,335
To be more jobs

172
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
In America

173
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
They lower the interest

174
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,015
A lower interest rate makes it cheaper Forte businesses to borrow money

175
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Right

176
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
So businesses borrow more money

177
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
They hire more people

178
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Good

179
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,975
Good fireworks

180
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,023
This is good and this is what the FED does say

181
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,863
Intersection they lower the interest rate business hire more people great

182
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,983
But then you get to this point we're almost everybody who wants a job has a

183
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:47,103
So now people can start demanding raises right cuz everybody's got a job

184
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,943
And people start getting raises they have more money they're buying more stuff

185
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
Now prices start

186
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
May you have

187
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
Inflation

188
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
And now the FED gets

189
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
Worried that inflation is going to get to

190
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
Too high so

191
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
They do the opposite of what they did before

192
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,255
Before they lowered interest rate now they raise interest

193
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,071
This Rose is whole process in Two Rivers

194
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,143
Right in the feds job is to balance these two things

195
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
To have an economy with lots of jobs and not too much inflation so the question really is how do you put a

196
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,103
The number on not too much inflation I like

197
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,687
How do you pick an inflation Target that you're trying to hit

198
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,735
I called up Alan Blinder

199
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,551
He's an economist who is the vice chair of the Fed

200
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
Back in the back in the mid-90s

201
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,927
Not too much inflation question is a really hard question

202
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:38,047
He said in fact when he was at the fed the people there whose job was to decide what inflation tube

203
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
They couldn't

204
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
Some people thought we should be shooting

205
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
E-40

206
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,727
Some people thought we should be shooting for 2%

207
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,079
Some people were content with a 3% which is about where we were

208
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,151
But he told me that after he left the FED overtime

209
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Over

210
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
Decades release

211
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
There was this conversion

212
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
This convergence on this

213
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
2%

214
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
Why 2%

215
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
What a splinter

216
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Why 2%

217
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
That's a really good question

218
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,535
Because it's not so obvious that you was right

219
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:14,399
Okay it's still not happy

220
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,727
In fact you don't do the listeners question it's not like some precise

221
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,567
Academic answer where they did all kinds of experiments and whatever it's like

222
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
Poop like a pretty good number and and cures

223
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
Pictures of Reason Blinder

224
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
He said

225
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,759
You want inflation to be low obviously High inflation

226
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
But you really

227
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,879
Do not want inflation to go pillows

228
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
You do not want deflo

229
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Right that means you have

230
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
Falling prices

231
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
And falling wages

232
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
And that is bad for people who have

233
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:47,167
That's it tends to lead to more bankruptcies it's just bad for the economy as a

234
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
So that's what the fallacy

235
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Taking you know we don't want

236
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
And blenders

237
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:57,151
Defenders that whatever inflation rate at Targets they're not going to hit it like right exactly on the

238
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
Whatever Long Run Park

239
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
The central bank

240
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
Set

241
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:08,415
What you going to see in history if everything goes right is random fluctuations above and below is he

242
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
Economy gets buffeted by various

243
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,255
Higher lower

244
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,583
So if you're quite worried about going below zero

245
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
The deflation

246
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
That argues.

247
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
Give yourself a buffer

248
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
Give yourself a buffer

249
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,495
2 is a nice round number

250
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,335
It gives you a little wiggle room I like if we miss a little low we're still not going to be a thief

251
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,199
So to be clear blender says it took us a long time to agree on this info

252
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,063
And then after that they had to decide okay now we are ready to talk publicly

253
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Tell the world

254
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
Until finally on January 25th

255
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Mm

256
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
Ben Bernanke who was the chairman of the Fed

257
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
He had this press conference where

258
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
He dropped the bomb

259
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
The committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2

260
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
2%

261
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,703
Is most consistent over the longer run

262
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Leather satchel

263
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
Mandate

264
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,407
Boom percent so here we are

265
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
4 years later

266
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
Last thing I'll say

267
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,807
It is a good thing that the FED gave himself that will

268
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
Because back beginning of 2012 when they announced

269
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
This target

270
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
Inflation was right there around 2

271
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
It fell below 2%

272
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,839
And to send for 4 years month after month after month

273
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,423
Inflation has been below 2% every month

274
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,727
So it's a good thing we have the buffer Jess

275
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,775
Jacob Goldstein thank you so much

276
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799

Christian about Kirk and I just wanted to ask if you guys would consider doing a story on Wars that have

278
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Started

279
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,111
Do the abundance or lack of access

280
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Different commodities

281
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,951
Such as sulfur whale Alero

282
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
Or today now crude oil

283
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767

Pretty well pretty well what do you got

288
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
So my question had to do with

289
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Wars that

290
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871

293
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
End

294
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479

Yeah you mean stuff in order to fight the wars and some people have wars over septic

313

There was a Guana War there was a war fought over guano like that

All these centuries of bird droppings and they discovered that they were very helpful and growing things

322
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
And there was a war

Durbin Lumber their Budweiser for beaver pelts

What must be like the single

326
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
Deadliest

A blood-soaked

340
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Death is like

341
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Wrapped up in the

342

Sleepman mm mm

348
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,399
The cinnamon itself the spice trade

349
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
Was just in

350
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,471
Violet it was mostly ruled by

351
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
By the Dutch

352
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,543
And there were multiple worse by 2%

353
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,615
Cinnamon and Nutmeg which there is a tiny bit in the cinnamon roll

354
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
There were multiple nutmeg Wars

355
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
Imagine going over nutmeg

356
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
But there were Wars over nutmeg also we

357
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,695
Big lot of wheat Wars right room in Egypt

358
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,231
French Revolution partly

359
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Over some

360
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,327
Weed issues also I figure you know oil was involved

361
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,143
Delivery of the cinnamon roll

362
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,935
So there's oil wrapped up in there

363
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,287
This is just an incredibly deadly item I will never look at cinnamon rolls the same way again

364
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
Stacey Vanek Smith

I do it is not a subject near and dear to my heart

371
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
International postal rates

372
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:07,167
Hi my name is Jeff khaki so I live it in Seattle my sister lives in Sri Lanka

373
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,055
And I how could it be that I could send a letter to my sister and she Lanka

374
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:17,407
And to Vancouver Canada and which is just a few hours away

375
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
For the same rate

376
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,783
Is that really true that is really true let me show you something right here

377
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
This right here

378
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,415
Is an international Forever stamp cost a dollar fifteen

379
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,767
Shape of a bun and you put a letter and it will go anywhere

380
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
In the world

381
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,887
I know I did this a real thing and of course that's amazing because there's some places

382
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
That are much harder to get to

383
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,263
Where do you think the most expensive place

384
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
In terms of the cost and end

385
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,103
What is the most expensive place to send a letter

386
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
So I'm going to guess it's

387
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
The country with

388
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,455
Bad infrastructure

389
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,271
And maybe the US has some

390
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
Problems with it

391
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
So Sudan

392
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
Central African Republic

393
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,719
Yeah see where you going with that but you're thinking in the wrong

394
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Directions

395
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
Because I talk to a postal expert

396
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,607
And he said listen most of the cost of delivery

397
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Is paying salary

398
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,679
Paying the mailman and mail women

399
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
To deliver it at the end and so

400
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
He speculated the country

401
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,823
What is the most expensive descent 2 is Norway

402
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,175
Because the mail men and women are like paid really it's so very expensive

403
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
Countryman

404
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,599
And so if you send a letter to a place like China or India it is much much much cheaper because the labor cost parasoul

405
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
Soap to Interjet

406
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,951
Question that like why are we charged the same amount to gota

407
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Vastly

408
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Different countries

409
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
And really that's just for the

410
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
Use of the

411
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
These are sending a letter they don't you have to

412
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,143
Standing by the post office and be like well

413
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
Was it cost to get a piano stand

414
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
Norton Norway

415
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
Zimbabwe

416
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,775
Look at what you charge an amount that we know

417
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Covers all the international

418
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Dolphin

419
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
Dollar 15

420
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,175
Now Jessica did have a follow-up question

421
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
This is where it gets

422
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,015
Even more complicated is one rate

423
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:04,671
Then who pays for what like how who pays for the boat that goes across the ocean or the airplane that flies that your lawn

424
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,767
Ponca City to get my posted bear and vice versa

425
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,327
I mean if I send a letter to Sri Lanka for a buck

426
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,655
How much money does the US keep and how much does

427
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Sri Lanka

428
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,495
So I went over this with Jim Campbell

429
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
Hefei postal consultant

430
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
And he said there's actually an organization called the

431
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
I was going to International

432
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,431
I think it's the universal

433
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,967
Postal Union

434
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Cannot be real

435
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:35,391
It is a real thing there's a meeting right now in Istanbul and what they do there is they argue about the details of

436
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Who pays

437
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
For what

438
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,279
You know what other words what serve little share of stamp Revenue goes to

439
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,863
Sri Lanka if Sri Lanka is doing the final delivery of the letter

440
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,423
So I'm imagining this like big boom and there's all these

441
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,959
Male ladies and mailmen

442
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,799
And in their in their shorts and they parked their little wheelie bags and then they kind of

443
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,615
Yell at each other always have $0.40 to $0.52

444
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:01,247
That was like going to the gym the postal Consulting he said

445
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Now we wear suits

446
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,183
Well my question

447
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
Is about ensuring

448
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,303
Insurance is at the top of the Planet Money pyramid of the

449
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Nerdy things that we care about

450
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
You know what I like

451
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,191
This question because we got it from more than one per

452
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
So we did a thing

453
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
It seems like

454
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,311
Here is Dave Allen

455
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:30,175
So I recently moved from Columbus Ohio to Alameda California

456
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967
And transferred my Auto in

457
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
From Ohio to California

458
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
And I was floored when my

459
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,111
2011 Hyundai Elantra went from

460
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,415
$390 for every

461
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,791
2 / 900 every 6 months your insurance more than doubled

462
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,863
Yes yes for the exact same coverage

463
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,423
Exact same

464
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
Driving record

465
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
Same car

466
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
Why does his insurance.

467
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,567
Alright here's what I liked about Dave

468
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,591
He had theories

469
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
The first one

470
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
He said look

471
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,455
Maybe labor costs are higher in

472
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:07,551
State Farm agents get paid more like the mail carriers in Norway

473
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
I checked that is not

474
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Second

475
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,207
Reasonable idea he said since he moved to California he's seen all of these really

476
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
Sick cars on the road

477
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
Tesla to keep seeing test

478
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
Maybe it's

479
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,887
The cars are $100,000 cars anymore insurance

480
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
Premium goes up

481
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,215
So I asked an actuary about that theory

482
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
Amy said

483
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
It's not about they're actually

484
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,639
He said that will bump up your premium but only about 5%

485
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
And Dave's

486
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
Doubles

487
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
So it's something

488
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Stripes

489
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,295
Evening the actuaries name is Bob Hunter

490
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,367
I need to listen there's hundreds of variables that go into

491
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Determining how much

492
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,415
To pay for your insurance

493
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
But

494
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,743
In the state of California which is where they've moved

495
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
There is a

496
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Big one

497
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,631
If you look at that one of the key drivers of racing is traffic density

498
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,191
And California has some of the

499
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,519
Mustard's traffic to LA San Francisco

500
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
In the nation

501
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,639
Wait a minute like I know that's true there's a lot more cars on the road but I found

502
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,943
Lower

503
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
Of an accident you might

504
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,271
Think and yet

505
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
More cars on the road means

506
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
More things to hit

507
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:20,000
If you're out in the middle of nowhere a little distraction you can have a lot of Destruction still be going down the street road and

508
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,048
Nevada I mean in Nebraska

509
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,888
But if we have a little bit of distraction in Manhattan

510
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
If you got an accident

511
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
Totally make sentence cityman

512
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,032
Density test

513
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,616
Bob the actuary told me he still didn't really think they

514
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
Premium should have

515
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,688
CC

516
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
Treat mites and in fact

517
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,528
Text Dave after he heard $900

518
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,320
He was so taken aback

519
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,928
That he haggled with the agent a little bit and he got about a hundred and fifty bucks knocked off

520
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
So that actually suggest

521
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,560
Another. I'm going to pause it here which is now in California

522
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
People sometimes just

523
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,888
Charge more and hope that the

524
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,680
Rich people in California will pay for

525
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
So that agent was Clear Lake

526
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
Maybe he'll pay

527
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
You don't mess with a guy for

528
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
From Columbus Ohio

529
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
Exactly

530
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,296
