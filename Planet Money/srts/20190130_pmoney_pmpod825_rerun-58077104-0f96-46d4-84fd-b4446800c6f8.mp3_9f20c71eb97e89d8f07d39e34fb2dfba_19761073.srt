Hey it's Allie helm

9
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,784
There was big news yesterday out of my home state of Calif

10
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:27,648
The giant utility company at Pacific Gas and Electric or PG&E

11
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,696
Filed for chapter 11

12
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,720
Bankruptcy

13
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:31,488
Action

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,352
PG&E is one of the nation's biggest utilities they serve about 16 million

15
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,120
People

16
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,912
And this news comes after

17
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,192
2 years of

18
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,752
Really bad wildfires

19
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,032
Across California

20
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,848
Investigators have said that PG&E equipment caused

21
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,128
Some of those fires

22
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,200
And the company is facing billions of dollars

23
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
Potential liability

24
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
Last year we did a story about wildfires and Fire and Ice

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,832
Navigation

26
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:01,696
And the questions we ask then are right at the center of what is happening with PG&E

27
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,000
So we're re-airing that story today

28
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,072
It originally ran it February 2018

29
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
They're these videos you may have seen a while back it felt like they were everywhere for a while they're shot

30
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
Cop from cars driving down the 405 freeway in Los Angeles it's dark out the car

31
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,832
Cars drive through this Valley and they pass between two Hills that aren't completely

32
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
On fire it looks like the cars are driving straight

33
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
Straight down into hell I grew up

34
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,728
Not far from those Hills and I spent a lot of time watching these videos

35
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
Wildfires

36
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,544
For spreading throughout Southern Calif

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
Fornia it was

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
A really bad viruses

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,712
I'm about to get on the 405

40
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
I went out to Los Angeles

41
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,808
Because I really wanted to

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
Stand on those Hills

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
I wanted to see

44
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
What do they look like now

45
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
So I drove up there

46
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,328
I got out of my car and right away I saw a house that has

47
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
Nearly burned wow pass the house there was a trail leading up into the Hills

48
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
I can see the 405 freeway down blow me

49
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,016
Trees oh my God there's like a shell of a car on the side of the Hill

50
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,392
It's like walking through a weird Wasteland it's really eerie

51
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't know what exactly I'm looking at except that the fire was

52
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Definitely

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
Here

54
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352
But I cook someone who

55
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,168
Would know what he's looking at

56
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
Hi are you Robert

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,032
Hello Robert Rowe agree to meet me here because

58
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,592
He can look at a burnt up Hillside like this

59
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,896
And read it like a book

60
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:02,784
He's a former firefighter and for more than a decade now he has had his own fire investigation come

61
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,832
I design my own logo

62
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,184
What's your look up little guy with a magnifying glass with a flat top and

63
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,976
Espiral Got Run

64
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,280
And your Biro.

65
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
We start walking up the hill together

66
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
So when you walk

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
Up here

68
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
What do you notice

69
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
First I mean to me it just looks like a sort of

70
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
Apocalyptic

71
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Bland

72
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
So as we're approaching a

73
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
A shrub year

74
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,944
We're going to be looking at Robert starts

75
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
Turning over rocks

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,528
Pointing out trees that are burned almost

77
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,344
Despot that were in it's like

78
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,696
One chapter of the fire that burned here was called the skirball fire

79
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
A discoloration on the

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,072
Reading this

81
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
To see where the Flames were coming from

82
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:54,496
Were they traveling up the hill or down the hill or across the hill

83
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
When we got up to the peak

84
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
He tells me that fire travel up there so there's no question

85
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,664
Did you see that right when you walked on the scene

86
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Well

87
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,528
Yeah pretty much when a wildfire breaks out

88
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
Pyro cops like Robert

89
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,136
They show at the scene and they have enormous

90
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Power

91
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
Because

92
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,024
The spot the fire started and the reason it started

93
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
Those are going to have huge

94
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Consequences

95
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,375
For a lot of people

96
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:26,495
You can identify the source of ignition down to fraction of an inch

97
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,799
And it becomes somebody's equipment

98
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
That either failed or somebody's action

99
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Then

100
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
Somebody can I go to jail

101
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:41,087
Or somebody's going to have a hefty recovery bill but they're going to have to pay

102
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,927
Billions

103
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,743

Teresa hurricane back to the first gust

109
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
But with a wildfire

110
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,639
You can find your way back to the first

111
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Spark

112
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
You can find a reason this disaster happened

113
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
And sometimes

114
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,295
Someone has to pay

115
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599

128
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
There's an official list

129
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
Of the top 10 most

130
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Destructive wildfires

131
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
In California

132
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
If you look at that list

133
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,143
Six of those fires happen

134
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
In the last

135
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
2 years

136
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Which is to say

137
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,519
Between October 2017

138
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
And the end of 2000

139
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
It has been to

140
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
Horrific

141
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Fire season

142
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,735
And next to each of those fires on this little list

143
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Is like a note

144
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
Were the cause of the fire wood

145
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Go

146
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,391
Pepper almost all of these recent fires

147
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
It just says

148
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
Under

149
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
It could take months for those investigations to wrap up

150
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
And so

151
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,839
We're going to look back at a different fire

152
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,167
One of the biggest most destructive fires in California history

153
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,727
And we're going to tell the story of

154
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
How that blank got filled in and

155
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
Residents are getting worried that they must leave their homes immediately within just the first few hours that the Witch Creek

156
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,295
Fire burn that fire quadrupled in size and right now

157
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,647
October 21st 2007 The Witch Creek fire started

158
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Somehow

159
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
And then spread

160
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Shockingly fast

161
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
It wasn't clear exactly how bad the damage would be but

162
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
One thing was clear

163
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,631
The Witch Creek Fire was going to be one

164
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
The big ones

165
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,239
I was on duty in Riverside unit as a fire captain specialist

166
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
This is Matt gay

167
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,591
He works for a state agency known as Cal Fire

168
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
Bass we got a phone call

169
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,687
Sending me to the wish fire

170
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
Lydia origin causes

171
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
When is the murder you attended

172
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
If when there's a fire

173
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
You send me

174
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,927
And soap Matt drive towards the area where the first reports

175
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Which means

176
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
Gives driving towards

177
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
The fire

178
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
Which is pretty intense

179
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
But Matt seems

180
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,423
Is Chill about it

181
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,239
Fairly typical for a job

182
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
Yeah it was it was barely

183
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,335
Somax driving through two sided fire

184
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,895
And he can see which way the Flames are blowing in the wind

185
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,455
So he knows roughly where the fire is coming from

186
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,527
He drive down to the edge of the burn Zone

187
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:54,367
There's still some smoke around black and grasses everywhere

188
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
This is where he start

189
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
His investigation

190
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,999
The part where I was at was on top of a ridge

191
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
The wind was blowing to the point where that at moments it was very good

192
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Difficult very difficult

193
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,935
But you can definitely feel the winds blowing your progress as your walk

194
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
The format can figure out what started

195
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
This fire he needs to figure out

196
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
Exactly where

197
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Is Firestar

198
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,383
And the fire leaves a lot of signs

199
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
But an investigator like Matt can follow back

200
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,343
He can see the direction that the fire burned across a tree it's like an arrow pointing

201
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Imports thesaurus

202
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
Same is true with

203
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
Charred rocks on the grill

204
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Trash

205
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
Cans and bottles anything that's left on the ground

206
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
He walks and walks

207
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,423
Follow the fires Trail and whines up at what he is almost certain is

208
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
Vspot the fire started the signs are

209
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
Pointing towards the spa

210
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,591
There's a dirt road winding through this Rocky Ranch Land

211
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,383
You would not be surprised

212
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
Cowboy riding through the background

213
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
And this is the point where the process

214
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Changes

215
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
Now that is looking for the actual

216
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
Cause

217
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
Fire and it is sort of like the game

218
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
Clue like he's figured out

219
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,743
That the crime was committed in the conservatory

220
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
And

221
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,375
He doesn't just get to look down and see if there's a wrench or revolver lying there

222
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,935
He has to eliminate all of the

223
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
Weapon choices

224
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
And figure out what actually started this

225
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
Yeah that's a process process of elimination

226
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
It's a way to make sure he

227
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
He's being as

228
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Thorough and scientific

229
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,711
And Matt has been like

230
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:30,111
Fire investigator school he has a whole list of these potential fire causes in his head

231
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
Used debris burning

232
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Lightning

233
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
Spontaneous combustion combustion

234
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
What is that

235
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,095
This is where I often times you will see you in

236
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Like a mulch pile

237
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
Under the right conditions can

238
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Sophie and

239
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
Yes

240
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
That's kind of insane

241
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Okay

242
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,967
Somat looks around for mulch piles

243
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
You didn't see anything

244
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,087
You check the dirt for tire tracks because cars can start fire

245
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
He looks berglas

246
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
Bottles

247
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,463
Apparently in rare circumstances some light can refract

248
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,255
Through a glass bottle

249
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
Start a wildfire

250
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,839
Matt doesn't see anything like that laying around

251
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
How about smoking I don't care about you know

252
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,983
Don't smoke a cigarette out your car window or whatever is that is that a real thing

253
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
It's

254
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
Not as common as one might think

255
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
All my partners and I

256
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
Cherry pack of cigarettes in the truck

257
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
And

258
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
We tried it and I have yet to

259
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,295
Mets sifting through dirt

260
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Shearing under rocks

261
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,367
Checking weather reports

262
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
He sees no cigarettes

263
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,951
No signs of arson no reports of light

264
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
Well at this point after all those

265
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
Right now we're looking at the power

266
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
The Powerline

267
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,423
Not really technical at this point in our conversation

268
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
He speaks carefully

269
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,775
I was able to observe damage to the power lines

270
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,359
Where it appeared to be small sections of the Powerline worms

271
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,991
When you said small sections were missing he means that there were Little Nick's in the metal wire

272
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
Are spots of visit

273
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Do you sort of thing

274
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
Did you know what's going on at that point

275
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,439
At this point it's not a 100%

276
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Determination

277
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
But

278
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,047
I've got something that bears further follow up

279
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:18,911
Here's the part of the story where we say the company that owned those power lines San Diego Gas & Electric

280
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
Declined to be interviewed

281
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:26,335
Never remember Matt starts this investigation on day one of the fire and within a day or two he is already

282
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Zeroing in on a car

283
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
But

284
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
He won't release information until he's done

285
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
Complete investigate

286
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,551
And so he keeps on investigating

287
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
In the meantime

288
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,415
All the public knows at this point is that the Witch Creek Fire is burning

289
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,207
And spreading and is very day

290
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
People actually did die in this fire

291
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
And other people are trying to escape

292
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:51,423
Some of them are recording videos as a cruiser home thread

293
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
Chillax is here

294
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,799
You can hear all the fire trucks in the distance

295
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,383
One person looking out his window seeing all of this

296
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Harry single

297
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
In very short order

298
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
The sky

299
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,343
Wildfire was moving dangerously close to Terry Cinco

300
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
So you were ready you were

301
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,207
Pretty much packed up

302
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,511
Stuff I really did not want to lose weight

303
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,351
50 years of photographs and that sort of thing

304
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
Cancel documents but that was

305
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
Mostly photos

306
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,103
Terry's able to laugh about this now

307
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,175
In part because the fire spared his house but

308
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
He's an attorney and

309
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,503
He's part of this Niche legal industry

310
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
Actually more like

311
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
Two armies

312
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,623
It start lining up when a wild fire starts to spread

313
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,719
Harry in the past has represented victims of wildfires just like this

314
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
And so

315
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Terry starts

316
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,095
Getting calls from people who are losing their homes

317
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
And they're saying

318
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Terry

319
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,959
Is there going to be anything we can do about this

320
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
And on the other side of the

321
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
Car companies

322
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,055
Who are calling their attorneys and wondering

323
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
Are we going to get sued for this

324
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
And some of them may have called

325
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Randy Campbell

326
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
Anything that can create a spark

327
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:13,087
Can anyone who can be responsible for creating that spark could be a client of mine someday

328
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,671
In 2007 Randy was a lawyer for a cable company

329
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
And a tree trimmer

330
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,535
Moving company that got sued over other big fires burning near which cricket

331
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,631
Randy has been a part of this Wildfire legal world for

332
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Years

333
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
He says

334
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,263
When a fire starts spreading you'll have all these opposing lawyers and

335
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,823
They hire private fire investigators

336
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
Insurance companies have lawyers and

337
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
Their own investigators

338
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,223
They're all showing up on the perimeter of these buyers

339
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Sometimes

340
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
Literally

341
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:49,439
I'll go to places I was working a fire in Texas Nathaniel still burning I'm walking down this dirt road missed a small town

342
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Town in Texas I turn a corner

343
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
And there are five guys I know

344
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
Sounds like a traveling Road Show sometimes

345
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,911
To Randy hears about the fires in San Diego and

346
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
And he goes down there

347
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
Terry the lawyer for victims

348
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
He's there to both of them are getting information

349
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
From their

350
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
Gators word is

351
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,175
Going around that power lines may have been involved in one of the fires

352
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,015
And so these two legal armies are gearing up

353
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,831
But the official word on the cause

354
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
Is going to come

355
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
From Matt Gilbert

356
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
What he found

357
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
After the break

358
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
Support for this podcast

359
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
In the following message

360
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
Should come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

361
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
Developing solution

362
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,655
Strong families and communities

363
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,983
To help ensure a brighter future for America's children

364
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,567
More information is available at aecf. Org

365
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,151
Matt Gilbert had Cena's damage power lines

366
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
The origin of the Witch Creek Fire but

367
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,759
To be sure about the cause he got in touch with the

368
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
The first person to report the

369
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
What's a pilot

370
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
Who works with the same state agency is

371
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
Cal Fire

372
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,463
The pilot was in the air over which

373
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
Creek and saw the fire when

374
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Still small

375
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
Matt wants to know if he

376
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,607
He'd see anything weird around that spot

377
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
And the pilot says

378
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
You know

379
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
Okay did see something

380
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
Power lines

381
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
Observe the line of

382
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,079
Bluish colored flashes

383
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
That works

384
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
Blowing With the Wind waves

385
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Power lines

386
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:20,831
To be as certain as possible Matt gets access to data from San Diego Gas & Electric about those very Powerline

387
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,367
Fine sea salt the area of origin

388
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
It's her technical data but

389
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
He reads it

390
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
And conclude

391
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
On the day of a fire

392
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,815
Just minutes before that fire was first reported

393
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Something happy

394
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
With the power lines

395
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
That very well may have caused

396
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
The first Spark

397
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
So at this point are you 100% sure

398
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,639
At this point I was comfortable releasing the official causes of

399
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,223
Would you say 100% I mean

400
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
Basically at this point when I

401
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,111
Based on all the available information I have

402
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,183
I think in that Gilbert speak that means he's Shore

403
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,999
He says in the scheme of fires he's investigated

404
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
This one was pretty clear

405
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,351
Enzyme that releases the official cause of the witch Queen

406
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Greek fire

407
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,447
It was the power lines operated by San Diego Gas

408
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
Electric

409
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,311
Lawyers had already launched into the legal battle lawsuits had already

410
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
You been filed

411
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,383
And now with an official cause

412
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
Even more Suits start come

413
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
How many cases were there about this far

414
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
I think

415
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
2000 kisses

416
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,743
That number includes the Witch Creek Fire and those two other fires that were burning nearby at the same time and it was actually Eva

417
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
Even more than 2000

418
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
All told there were about

419
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
26

420
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
100 claims

421
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
Van by those fires

422
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,215
Loads of people sued San Diego Gas & Electric

423
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
San Diego Gas & Electric

424
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Turned around and sued

425
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
Some other companies like

426
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,639
Randy's clients who are in charge of tree trimming for example

427
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,199
Victims Sue those companies as well

428
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Kenny everybody is suing everybody

429
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
And

430
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
In the end

431
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
The companies

432
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,623
Do not admit fault or liability

433
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,207
But they do pay a lot of money in settlements

434
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,791
In total for all the fires plus legal fees

435
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
More than 2 billion dollars

436
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
Got paid out

437
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
That money got paid out by a number of entity

438
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
All told San Diego Gas & Electric

439
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Themselves

440
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,615
How to pay a reported 379 million dollars

441
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
The lawyers and two people

442
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
Who lost money or stuff

443
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
This whole process

444
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
Witch Creek Fire industry

445
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
It dried out

446
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
A

447
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
Long

448
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:36,511
As of 2018 there were still some lawsuits and loose ends getting sorted out

449
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,327
More than 10 years after that first

450
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,143
Terry though the lawyer for the victims

451
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
He's settled all his case

452
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,751
I asked what it felt like when he settled the last one

453
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
Emotional experience

454
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Going through that

455
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
You're supposed to be representing

456
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
And you

457
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,391
Terry says these big settlement payments do a couple things

458
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,719
They mean that victims get help rebuilding Our Lives

459
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,535
Money on top of any Wildfire insurance they may have

460
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,631
And the settlements also hold companies accountable

461
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,471
So they'll do all they can to prevent the next big wildfire

462
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,519
Get to prevent a disaster

463
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,591
But this raises an almost philosophical Quest

464
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
What is a natural

465
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
Disaster

466
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
And what is it disaster caused

467
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,783
Like if a deadly Wildfire is started by a lightning

468
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,087
Strike is it a natural disaster then

469
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
Probably

470
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
How about a bottle

471
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
Left there by human

472
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
Just the wrong way by sunlight

473
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
Is Hannibal the Foster

474
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,583
Maybe

475
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,911
And it started by a power line

476
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,447
Filter by humans

477
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:52,031
Who are supposed to be making sure that it doesn't cause a fire

478
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,847
Seems like that could be a human disaster

479
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,967
But climate change maybe making it harder to say what is an act of God and what's an act

480
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
The man like

481
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:07,391
What if a spark comes from a power line and then it lands on super dry brush that is dry because of a historical

482
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
A long drought

483
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,719
Where does the natural disaster end

484
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
Human disaster

485
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Begin

486
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,655
Back above the 405 freeway in Los Angeles I was

487
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,447
Heading home out of those Burnt Hills

488
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,751
And I stopped in front of that house

489
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:29,151
Oh my God you can see the the roofs caved in exposed pipes there's

490
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,455
Black and bean sticking up

491
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,551
We still don't know the source of many of the big fires that

492
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
California last year

493
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
But

494
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,927
Investigators actually did find the cause of this one

495
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:46,303
It was a cooking fire in a homeless encampment a little bit down the mountain

496
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
Any Spark

497
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
Can start a fire

498
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,703
But not all Sparks are financially

499
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:59,359
Sequel for the Spire there will be no huge settlement to help pay the price

500
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:12,159
