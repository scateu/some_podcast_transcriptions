00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:17,152
Will Harris runs the farm which has been in his family for more than a hundred year

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,528
And Will was raised by his father and trained in school to be a modern Industrial

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
Cattle farm

9
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,600
When I got out of college

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,904
I was excited

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,232
About a new pharmaceutical product light

12
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,536
Hormone implants

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,560
Why

14
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,840
Increase production

15
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,632
You you are able to do

16
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,192
More and more cheaper and cheaper

17
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,496
Will take over from his father

18
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,032
Made a profit every year

19
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,848
But at some point the way you looked at the world started to chew

20
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:53,248
I wish I had a better story to tell you I wish it was the burning bush something but got a big bed one like that

21
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
It was way more gradual than that and it happened in all these different

22
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,904
For one thing he started to look at the soil

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,208
I noticed that

24
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,488
Soil

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,024
Just over that fence

26
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,072
Wade

27
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,120
Soil right here

28
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,728
He saw that the soil on the other side of the fence so that had just been left alone was

29
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,752
Teeming with life

30
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,056
This will right here on his farm

31
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Was debt

32
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,152
She thought it was in the world and is just a fence

33
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,176
A wire fence

34
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:28,576
And then there was the day he was sending off about a hundred cattle onto a double decker truck to go to a feedlot thousands of miles

35
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,880
He realized maybe on the truck for days

36
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,696
The ones on the top would be going to the bathroom on the ones on the

37
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
And

38
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,584
Ulysses Ramos that we have had on this Farm

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,400
Nurture them to Care album

40
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,192
It just didn't seem right

41
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,288
And eventually he decided to change everything about the way he

42
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,360
You bringing chickens to fertilize the grass

43
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
The grass would nurture the

44
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:57,760
The cattle Shoppers at Wholefoods with line up around the block to buy his

45
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
It was also

46
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
Perfect it was such a

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,208
Beautiful vision of the enlightened 21st century American Farm

48
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:11,072
It wasn't that so perfect that a literal symbol of America showed up at his farm

49
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
The bald eagle

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,424
But the bald eagle America's bird

51
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
Was not on board with Will Harrison

Goatee shaved head white Stetson hat

He drives around all day in history

71
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,944
Basically running is

72
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
And a few weeks ago I tagged along with

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,904
This house was built in 1870 something by my great grandpa one day I live with my grandfather built

74
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,744
Open early nineteen hundreds

75
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:50,400
My day was bigger than me and meaner than me and talk more like Foghorn Leghorn than I do

76
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
Seems impossible

77
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:57,056
I mean the f*** was like nothing mean

78
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,152
By the way will Harris knows we are maybe making fun of his accent

79
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432
And he's fine with that

80
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
In fact he's also making fun of rxn

81
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,832
He told me the story about when he first started selling his meat at Whole Foods

82
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:13,696
He would visit the stores to be that sustainable farmer standing at a table handing out samples of

83
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,536
A guy like you or lady

84
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,095
Won't mind take a little sapling

85
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,679
Which natural killer cell phone iPhone go

86
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
Honey

87
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Mission

88
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
I'm Whole Foods and

89
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,359
There's this guy here and he's serving this beef end

90
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:37,759
I know we said we were going to have salmon for dinner but what do you think get beef will you think

91
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,623
Can you imagine what my wife would think if I called

92
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,927
If she was shopping to call me

93
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
We should

94
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
Mission Food

95
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,679
So we're driving down this this four-lane highway that runs through the middle of Will Smith

96
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,543
And at some point we pull off and go down this dirt road into this really green pasture

97
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:06,431
You could see there was like a forest off in the distance really beautiful and Will turns off the engine

98
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,735
To tell me you know how we went from being

99
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:13,855
An industrial farmer to selling you know pasture-raised organic high-end meat at home

100
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,183
One of the first things he did was quit using pets

101
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,303
But we needed that these new kinds of grass has started growing in his field and the cows would need them

102
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,095
We brought in sheep and goats

103
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,399
He also quit using chemical fertilizer

104
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
Breading chicken

105
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
Here we buy

106
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
Feed for the chickens

107
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
And

108
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,127
If he turns into poultry that we sell

109
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,967
By product to use the menudo that goes over the pastor that makes

110
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Scrafty

111
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Genius

112
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:48,415
The chickens are spread out all over the farm you know that wasn't here that was in there and their manure is his fertilized

113
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,023
And then he realizes if he's going to sell this high-end meet at a premium

114
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,631
Send his animals off to the industrial slaughterhouse with all the commodity cows

115
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,959
So he decides to build his own sweater

116
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
Which is Barry

117
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
But he's still started growing

118
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,455
He got his meat into a bunch of Whole Food stores and Publix this chain of grocery stores in the South also started selling is made

119
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
He was paying off that debt

120
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
And then

121
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,831
About a year after he brought in the chickens

122
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
The first pair of eagles show

123
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:25,023
So I was very excited about if I was great and I love natural systems and I love

124
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
Nature nopales fantastic

125
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
We'll quickly saw that

126
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
The Eagles

127
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
Loved his

128
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,959
Pasture-raised organic chicken

129
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,751
But it was okay with it

130
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
Who's just a few Eagles

131
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
He told himself

132
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
The Eagles are like Nature's version of quality

133
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
Little kill

134
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
The quickest

135
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Healthiest

136
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Bird you got

137
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
Trattoria people

138
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,599
You never get a sick bird from White Oak pastures

139
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
Everyone you get this

140
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,719
Your sister can say all that random

141
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
The thing will didn't realize

142
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,863
Is that when Eagles discover an all-you-can-eat

143
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
Chicken buffet

144
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
The word spreads fast

145
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,519
The first year that was at two or three the next year that was

146
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,359
Maybe till 12

147
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
This year maybe 30 or 40

148
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
Last year

149
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
They said it was 77

150
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,295
You have more this year

151
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,343
As more and more Eagles started showing up

152
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
More and more chicken started die

153
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
Eva long time

154
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:29,791
Her for my employees what's eating my ass up back there

155
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,607
Alright I need it bad

156
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,167
And I wanted to be all right

157
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,263
But at some point I had to show you know they really are

158
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
Causing economic

159
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,895
Place and then Eminem lose money on broiler

160
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,967
Would you make money on chickens if not for the Eagles

161
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Topix

162
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
Over the past few years will says

163
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
The Eagles have killed

164
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
Hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of his

165
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
The peak season is winter

166
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Right now

167
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,047
And will says the Eagles are currently killing a hundred or more of his chicken

168
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Everyday

169
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
Thousands of chickens a month

170
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
And this is easy to see

171
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,727
You just drive out into one of the fields where the chickens

172
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:16,639
So what happened with Sarah I don't know couple hundred chickens here a hundred mg I don't have a son

173
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
Cost of a thousand chickens

174
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
And there's some of them

175
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,647
Some around in the grass some of them are kind of chilling out under this thunder tree over there

176
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,511
You on the shoulder the chicken house or something or eating the feed

177
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
Drinking the water

178
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,143
Feel like these chickens are living the dream but for one thing man

179
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Bald eagles

180
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
They're just

181
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
Sitting there in the trees right at the edge of the field

182
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,407
They don't make that screeching sound like you hear in the movies they don't really make any sound at all but they do look

183
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,551
Big and beautiful you know they look like a postage Stamper something you'd see airbrushed on the side of the van

184
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,183
But right there in front of us in this chicken Paradise were standing in our chickens the Eagles have killed

185
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,255
So this got so this were looking at here is basically

186
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
The back half of

187
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Chicken right there

188
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,095
Feet and legs

189
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,447
But the top half is essentially the eagle

190
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
Easiest way into the body cavity

191
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
Have you seen that

192
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:22,431
That happening with your seen thousands of time Eagles are sticking his head in that body cavity

193
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:27,039
Episode 2 of why did it legally this is pink because it gets all that blood on it

194
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,879
So there's that this guy with somebody basically ate right this is a

195
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
Eating up chicken

196
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,743
Then there's this other chicken 3 feet away it's also dead

197
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
This chicken was just just killed

198
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Because it was fun

199
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
Nothing is happened to it

200
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
How many

201
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Eagle Strike

202
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
Brightness

203
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,287
Just like a sport just like

204
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,103
Screw you I'm going to kill one more ticket

205
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
The rudest Beast evolved

206
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,735
Will Harris has completely transformed his

207
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
Farm to live in harmony with nature

208
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
And now here is nature

209
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,159
Sticking its head into his body cavity and eaten his financial

210
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
WhatsApp

211
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,975
It's kind of in space all the time

212
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
Betting legal

213
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,559
Mega missile juvenile bald eagle

214
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Looks like

215
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
Full and happy

216
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,311
How do you feel seeing all these Eagles just coming and eating your chicken

217
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
Oh

218
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,151
Universal mixed bag

219
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,991
You know I can have it shotgun right now he's pointing at the backseat of the

220
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
Aeropostale

221
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,463
He shot at other predators that were attacking his livestock

222
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
But Hair Says

223
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,791
Hey he doesn't want to shoot bald

224
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
And be even if he did want to

225
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,167
Eagles have their own special law to protect them

226
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,983
The bald and golden eagle protection act

227
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
Which makes it a crime to quote

228
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,615
Pursue shoot shoot at poison wound kill

229
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,431
Capture trap collect molest or disturb

230
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
Eagles

231
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
Will Harris is in a bind

232
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,087
Westfall he did get some good news from the Federal

233
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,391
Keeping granted a special permit

234
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
Not to kill that Hugo

235
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
But to harassed

236
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,511
Basically try and make them go away

237
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
So he's trying all of these different things

238
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
One of the first things he did

239
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,959
You got one of those giant inflatable people like you see outside the car wash

240
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,263
You don't like this some kind of fan inside of Minnesota

241
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,567
Bend over and snap back up

242
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
He bought one of those

243
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
And put it up next to some chicken

244
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
He says it'll take about 15 minutes

245
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
To figure out there was just like one of those floppy guys

246
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
I actually saw this quickly

247
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,951
It was just lying on the ground the generator that powers and was out of gas

248
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,023
What about 15 or 20 feet away from a bunch of chickens

249
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
And yes one of the chicken

250
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,143
Will also put sparkly Flags out

251
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Eagles didn't say

252
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Seem to notice

253
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:57,567
You got this big old noise cannon with a barrel like 3 ft long you could hear it miles away

254
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
Eagles didn't seem to care

255
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
Another thing you tried

256
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
Admit

257
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
Over the top

258
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:09,343
Like a canopy over the open area where the chickens were walking around but apparently Eagles do not have to attack from the sky

259
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,695
We were just walk and Landon woke up under the net and get the chicken

260
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,255
Will is trying one other thing to make

261
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
The Eagles go away

262
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Maybe the most badass

263
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
Of all the things he

264
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,679
He sent me out with this poultry manager Jeff Lackey to see you tonight

265
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:29,311
There we go there's an eagle right there a circle around to kill a chicken

266
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
Definitely I left his lunch

267
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
Oh he just moved down

268
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,991
We drive across this field get out my chicken house

269
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
There's a couple thousand chickens walking

270
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
And just spot San Diego

271
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
Actually looks like there's one the Pharcyde that tree there

272
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
He pulls out what looks like a little little pistol

273
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
This is

274
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,119
A cap gun of sorts that takes these two caps in the back

275
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,703
Benny opens up this yellow box and pulls out his

276
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Ammunition

277
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
Take two

278
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,823
Black and goes into the gun so those look like little

279
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Firecracker

280
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,663
Chris basically asking small m-80s almost

281
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
What to say

282
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
Bird banger

283
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
Warning

284
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
Danger

285
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
15 mm

286
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,903
Captain has two barrels people it's one Banger in each Barrel

287
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Posi trigger

288
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
This firecracker shoots out like

289
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,839
25 feet and explodes in midair

290
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
Then he pulled the trigger again

291
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
And there they go

292
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,311
Did you see on the backside I treat are there here's one right now

293
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
Eagle flying away

294
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,151
We can move them with the Birdman

295
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
And then they just come back

296
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:44,319
Or the yellow go to another spot for now or we got more birds and

297
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,927
Just circle around the many many pastures so this is it I can eat these chicken

298
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
I think it's going to go eat some other chicken

299
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
Yeah for the next couple hours

300
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
Then they're going to eat this chicken

301
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,583
Configure TV chicken

302
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:01,215
Will Harris says that you know maybe he's losing fewer chickens this year cuz of the bird bangers

303
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
Really to send it

304
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,591
But in any case he is still losing a lot he still losing money on his chicken

305
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,687
There is one other way will might be able to keep his chicken business

306
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,551
It's a federal program that pays Farmers whose animals are killed by protected in

307
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,599
Boy killed by say bald eagle

308
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
How much do you think they should give you

309
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,511
The maximum is $125,000 per year

310
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,095
And I owe me that for 15 and 16

311
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,679
Has the government giving you any money for the eagles killing a chicken

312
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Now one time

313
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
No one.

314
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
He's in this legal fight with a gun

315
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
This back-and-forth

316
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,103
What's the right way to count the loss is what can

317
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
Can a proof do you need

318
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,991
Are we did reach out to the government on this they said the case is under review by the local office

319
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
And they're not allowed to discuss the

320
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
Whatever happens with the governor

321
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
It's clear that the Eagles are not going away

322
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
Are there like this living

323
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Killing

324
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Virgin

325
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
Of a much bigger

326
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,351
We want a world where we can restore some kind of balance Within

327
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,423
But every time we try to do that we realized

328
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
How empaths

329
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,031
You're right here on the farm you just keep seeing this Gap

330
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,103
Between how the world is and how we want it to be

331
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
But will is resourceful

332
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,199
Yorkie keeps trying to cross that Gap

333
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,759
At one point is we're driving around the farm

334
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,063
We're next to this field with some chicken tonight

335
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
And there's a pickup truck coming the other way

336
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Wheel stops

337
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,671
The Jeep to talk to the driver

338
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,815
Hey how yo

339
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,679
I feel like you would I'm glad you did

340
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
In the bed of a truck

341
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,311
There's a guy with a camera with this giant telephoto lens

342
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,871
Which is apparently pretty common

343
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,687
People now come to Wells Farm to see the Eagles

344
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,319
