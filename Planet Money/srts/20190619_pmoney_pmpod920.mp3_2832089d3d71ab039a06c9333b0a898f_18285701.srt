One of the greatest American Economist who ever lived was Irving Fisher

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,808
He was a true visionary

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,648
How to turn a really big important insights into really big important things

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,208
Monetary policy behavioral economics

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,232
And yet

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,000
Today

13
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,560
Almost nobody remembers any of that

14
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,632
If people today remember anything at all about Irving

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,728
What they remember is this one thing he said in the fall of night

16
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,288
He said

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,336
Stock market hit quote

18
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,384
A permanently High plateau

19
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,920
Few weeks later

20
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
The market

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712
Crashed

22
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,760
Irving Fisher state with sealed

23
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,552
He would forever be the

24
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Permanently High

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,648
But now imagine a different scenario

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,720
Suppose some big famous economist said

27
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:07,840
I am freaking out something very bad is about to happen in the economy and soon

28
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,376
And then the economy

29
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
Kept growing

30
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
4 years

31
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,704
Just expanding and

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,496
Expanding adding jobs

33
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,312
The markets resuming happily ever upward

34
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,896
Would that person have been mocked forever as the you know

35
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,688
Eminem precipitous crash person

36
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
No no

37
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,576
No everybody would have just been like hey

38
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,624
Thank you for warning us about that

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,904
Things that didn't happen

40
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
And then if a bad thing had happened

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,560
The person would have been hailed as the genius who warned us about the bad thing

42
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,144
Okay so now it is June of the year

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
2090

44
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
Here we are

45
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:48,288
Which means this month the economic recovery in the US turns 10 years old

46
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,360
Unemployment is at the very lowest in decades

47
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
Wages are finally climbing for most workers

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
And the incentives

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
For us

50
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
In This Moment

51
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
Could not be more

52
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,320
It is time for us to bravely.

53
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
Eclair

54
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,392
There are things we should be worried about

55
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:09,536
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm taking Golden Child

56
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,072
Mary you read about Finance

57
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
Forbearance that's true I write about worried people worrying about things for more worried people

58
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
What should we be worried about

59
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,384
It's not rhetorical we rounded up three legitimately very troubling answers

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,248
Actually we've rounded up a lot more than that but we narrowed it down to three so that you could ever sleep again

61
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,160

I'm Karen Duffin this is rough translation from NPR and our next episode we continue the story of a hoss

70
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
Stitch rescue operation created this impromptu Rescue Team the team finds Newcleus you know exactly who

71
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Louis

72
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:23,776
They sit down with Isis and they try to figure out who they can trust

73
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,568
We're almost at war with each other

74
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,896
Listen And subscribe this time on rough translation

75
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,248
Okay just a couple little bits of housekeeping before we

76
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Get into the shower

77
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,808
Number one

78
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,392
There are lots of things we should be worried about that we are not going to talk about it

79
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
Nuclear war

80
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
Underrated I think underrated as a warrior

81
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Probably

82
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,536
Climate change

83
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
Mass extinction related to climate change

84
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
Very big worries

85
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,728
Spit on Today Show we're going to focus more on that sort of short to medium-term ordinarily sort of

86
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Financial

87
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
Thing number 2

88
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,896
Planet money has done a version of the show already what should we be worried about

89
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
4 years ago

90
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,480
So for a first call we wanted to follow up with someone

91
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,040
That show who was worried about the stock market

92
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
Hi this is Jacob Goldstein NPR New York

93
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:15,488
And this is Bob Shiller Robert Shiller won a Nobel prize in economics for telling us what to be worried about

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,559
He looked at the housing market in mm

95
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
At the Bible

96
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,887
Same thing with the stock market in the late 1990s

97
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,215
4 years ago we had Yuan

98
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
On our show on Planet Money

99
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
You brought up the cape ratio

100
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
The cape ratio is this thing Schiller came up with

101
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
It's a way of measuring stock price

102
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,759
If you know price-to-earnings ratio is a version of that

103
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,623
But basically when it's high it mean stocks are more expensive when it's low stocks Archie

104
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:48,255
And here I can actually just play a little moment from that here's what you said in 2000

105
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
Is high

106
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,071
The only times it's been higher

107
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
We're 1929

108
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
And

109
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Mm

110
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,471
In 2007 was about tied

111
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
Spell trash can

112
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,335
Is that the only times it's been this High has been right before

113
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
Market crash

114
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,431
So I'm worried about that

115
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
So that was

116
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,527
2015 what happened after that

117
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,135
Stock market keep going up

118
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,767
Okay so I didn't say that it was going to crash eminently

119
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,863
What what do we what did you make of it were you too pessimistic

120
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Pick 4 years ago

121
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:32,799
Oh I think I didn't see that stock prices would go up as much as they have

122
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
Today that number that he watches the

123
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,175
The cape ratio is even higher than it was four years ago

124
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,527
Chiller still thinks that the stock market will probably fall

125
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
Because that's what always have

126
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,391
This is more or less the same thing you said when we talked to in 2050

127
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Survival

128
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Probably fall

129
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
When

130
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,023
But this time when I talk to him

131
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:58,399
He got into this hole bigger picture way of thinking about the economy and and landed on this

132
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
Whole other for nothing to worry about

133
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,495
He says when he thinks about the future of the economy

134
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,847
When this fall will happen whether it be sudden or gradual what effect it might have

135
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,431
He doesn't think about like what the FED is going to do or like

136
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,735
Commodity prices or any other techniques

137
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
Google measure

138
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
He thinks about how people feel

139
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
About the economy

140
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
Right now

141
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,927
The stock market is perceived as high

142
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
I know that I've been surveying people

143
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,071
And also the housing market is perceived to be high

144
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
It's not gotten people worried yet

145
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,679
But if you talking about worst-case scenarios

146
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
They could suddenly get worried

147
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,127
Who is this I'm talking about everyone in America

148
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
And then so what happens if everyone in America gets worried

149
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,295
Well then they would become less

150
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,111
Excited about investing in the stock market

151
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
And about

152
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
And also in the housing market

153
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Prices start

154
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
The fall

155
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
Those falling prices

156
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
Freak people out

157
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
They were

158
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,607
So they cut back their spending

159
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
They start saving more

160
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,959
Which means sales and profits for companies start falling

161
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,823
So then company start laying people off unemployment goes up the economy starts drinking

162
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,175
So you feel like we're all just sort of floating on this kind of

163
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
Cloud of

164
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
Optimism and the

165
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,063
Fear for you is not some technical change in the world but

166
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
Just some kind of

167
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
Femoral change in people's emotions

168
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,951
It suddenly will go from being

169
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,511
Hopeful to being scared and that that is

170
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,535
Itself will cause

171
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
Real economic

172
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
Yes

173
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,655
I hate you got it

174
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:39,775
That has happened before that is a very meta word

175
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
Well it's

176
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
I think that's

177
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Yeah

178
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:48,735
But we have to worry about really worried number one is not about the stock market

179
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
It's worried about worry

180
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
Thank you for your time

181
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
My pleasure to call you again in 4 years

182
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
Take your head don't tell me I was wrong

183
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
So at Barons I write about corporate debt

184
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,735
Which means I spend all my time talking to this little group of people that lend money

185
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,575
And little island it's all the same people go to the same

186
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,903
Princess and right now everybody on that island is

187
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
I have to say when you started telling me about

188
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,839
Life on this island I actually got worried like

189
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,935
Like I really did you know I mean I haven't thought much about corporate debt

190
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Before but

191
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,799
As we were reporting the story it became clear to me that in the you know

192
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
Relatively near few

193
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,711
Corporate debt could be a big deal not just for this little Universe of lenders and Borrowers

194
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,039
But for like millions of ordinary people who just

195
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
Go to work everyday and don't think anything else

196
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
Those people

197
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,695
Could be affected in a really big Way by what's going

198
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
One of my very favorite people to talk about this

199
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
This is Ann Walsh

200
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,631
I'm in Walsh on the chief investment officer for fixed-income for Guggenheim partners

201
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,727
Guggenheim Partners runs mutual funds manages money for big investors

202
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,055
Animals his job is basically lending investors money

203
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
To become

204
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,895
How much how much more less how much money do you manage

205
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,967
180 billion dollars from 80 billion dollars

206
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,295
It's a lot of money

207
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
It's a lot of money

208
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,903
I normally when you have a 180 billion dollars to lend

209
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
You get to make

210
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
The rules

211
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
Leonard Lake and make actual rules

212
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
People call them covenants and their huge deal on the

213
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,351
You can make a rule saying

214
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,191
Hey company we will lend you this money as long as you don't go out and borrow a bunch

215
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
More money

216
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
Were there rules that say

217
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
You can't sell your important

218
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Stop

219
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:54,687
Or saying that if something bad happens you have to call me immediately and we will have a very strongly worded conversation about it

220
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
So this this Covenant these rules they used to be

221
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
Totally normal in the

222
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,343
But now that has changed

223
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
Those rules have largely gone away

224
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
So if you

225
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,815
If you went to a bar or now somebody wants to borrow money and they're a little bit of a you know

226
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
Do they have a little bit of a

227
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
Whiskey company

228
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,447
And you said to them I will lend you money

229
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
If you promise not to go out and borrow money

230
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
What would they say

231
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,407
They say we're going to go find somebody else to lend us this money

232
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,247
It's easy it's heard there's so much out there

233
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,087
What's happening today is that companies are able to borrow money with

234
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
With none of those protection

235
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,439
Built-in because more and more people and incest

236
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Institutions

237
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
I got more and more money that they needed

238
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Did you invest to let out

239
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
Pension funds and

240
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:49,215
Rich people Saudi Arabia they're all competing to lend enormous sums of money

241
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
So now

242
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Borrowers

243
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Have the power

244
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
So you

245
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
Have a hundred 80 billion dollars to lend

246
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,919
And yet you don't have

247
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
For the power in this relationship

248
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
That would be correct

249
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,551
That's extraordinary

250
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,623
I think about that corporate debt in America is now at the

251
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,183
Highest level ever and with the loosest terms

252
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
First of all time

253
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
So right now

254
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
Lenders are being the cool Mom they're letting companies run around willy-nilly spending all the money running up the credit card

255
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
With no curfew

256
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,007
So in the weird little corporate that world where I live this is what everyone

257
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,823
Worried about so what answer this is there is a Next Step

258
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
Pierre and that next step is why

259
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,711
Everybody else all the other people who don't live in your little corporate debt world

260
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
Everybody else should also be worried

261
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:39,135
All those companies borrowing all that money they do normal things like run retail shops

262
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,951
We're Ordinary People go to work everyday

263
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
So at some point

264
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
Some of those companies

265
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
Won't be able to pee

266
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
Their debts

267
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,607
Do you have companies that start to default

268
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,519
They can't refinance they can't operate their businesses they have to lay off employees than those employees

269
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
Have to go find another job

270
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
Right now that's not such a

271
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,895
A big deal right now it's okay to find a job

272
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
But if the economy slows if there's a recession

273
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
All that corporate borrowing with almost no rules

274
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
Could mean lots and lots of

275
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
I won't be able

276
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
And I'll have to leave

277
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
And that is a terrible time

278
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
To get laid off

279
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
In a recession

280
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,815
All of a sudden those excess Jobs go away and it becomes a lot harder to become re-employed

281
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:25,215
I mean that that is its own spiral then right because then there's more people without jobs in their spending less that's bad for

282
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Companies

283
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,031
And that's the classic downward spiral

284
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Exactly

285
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
So this is wearing number 2

286
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
Big lenders stop Lending

287
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Companies that might have survived

288
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
If they hadn't borrowed so much and on such a

289
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
Easy terms just

290
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
After the break

291
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
One more thing to worry

Trade

309
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,847
For this chapter we caught up Chad Bown an economist at the Peterson

310
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
Who basically Specializes

311
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
Entry doors

312
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,991
What I actually focus on is the areas of

313
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Friction

314
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
And trade is right where things

315
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
Kind of begin to

316
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
Fall Apart

317
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
So this is your moment

318
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,023
This is the Superbowl this is yeah that's my moment is my Superbowl this is what I have

319
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,583
Forbetterforworse been preparing my entire life

320
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,655
Like 4 so President Trump has imposed tariffs on about

321
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
200 billion dollars of

322
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Chinese good

323
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,287
Has threatened additional tariffs on another

324
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
300 billion or

325
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
And what that means is American company

326
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
Import those goods

327
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
Have to pay tax

328
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
Of 25

329
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,039
And Chad is worried that the terrorists are going to hurt the economy

330
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
And anyways

331
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
I'm frankly that I find pretty interest

332
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
What he told us is

333
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,255
A lot of the taxes so far the ones that have already been put in

334
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,583
Ouran what Economist call intermediate Goods

335
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Basically just

336
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
Stuff companies use

337
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
How to make others

338
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,983
So you think about Ford or GM for example

339
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
They make cars in Michigan

340
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,335
But a lot of the stuff they use to make those cars

341
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
So if you go down the Tariff list which I happen

342
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
But to have right here

343
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
You can see lots and lots of

344
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Car and truck related things

345
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,391
Like electrical lighting equipment of a Kind used for Motor Vehicles or Cycles other than bites

346
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
Brakes and Servo brakes

347
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
And parts thereof

348
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,863
Fuel lubricating or cooling medium pumps for internal combustion piston engines

349
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,007
Not fitted with a measuring device could pump seems like the keyword there of a Kind used for persons in motive

350
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Call Stacy

351
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Sure

352
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
So there's actually more than a hundred

353
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
Car related

354
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Things on this

355
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
Amazing list that has all kinds of

356
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,271
What that means is now Ford and GM

357
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,599
And every other company that makes cars in the US

358
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Has to pay

359
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,927
A 25% tax to buy those parts

360
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,487
Or they could stop buying those parts

361
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
If they did that

362
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
They would probably have to pay more

363
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,351
Male part of President Trump's

364
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
Goal in all of this

365
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Seems to be to want to

366
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,471
Bring American production

367
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
American manufacture

368
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Back to the United

369
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
Some of these tariffs

370
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
May be successful in doing that

371
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
He may Force companies

372
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,967
Is that if you want to sell to American consumers you have to make it

373
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Here

374
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,527
But the implications of that are

375
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,183
The prices to American consumers are going to be a lot higher and these American companies that are making here they're not going to be able to produce Pro

376
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
Products that are going to be

377
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,279
Commercially viable anywhere else in the world

378
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,327
You can sell them to American consumers

379
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,399
But 95% of the world's consumers don't live in America

380
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:12,799
Asia or Europe or elsewhere and they're just not be willing to pay these much higher price

381
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
So that's where we are now

382
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,407
It's harder for us companies to compete around the world

383
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,503
Okay but I still feel like I could be like

384
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
A little bit more worried

385
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Shut down

386
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
So a really bad scenario

387
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
Would be President Trump

388
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
Following through

389
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,255
An imposing all of his tariffs on China

390
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Andino

391
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
The full 500 in

392
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,863
Something billion dollars worth of imported

393
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
25%

394
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:42,495
Then President Trump getting upset that progress isn't happening with Mexico with the Border

395
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,031
And he decides to impose

396
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
Tariffs on imports from Mexico

397
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,223
Play further gets upset with Japan and Europe that don't do something that he wants perhaps on a NATO or cooperation somewhere else

398
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,759
Nelson imposes tariffs on

399
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Cars coming in from those

400
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,391
Now all of a sudden if you're going out and buying a car car prices are going to be higher

401
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
For you

402
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,535
If you're going back to school shopping with your with your kids and trying to buy clothes or supplies

403
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
Prices are going to be higher for you

404
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,399
If you're an American company if you want to sell your product

405
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
In Europe or in Asia

406
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,519
You're not going to be able to compete anymore because your costs are so much higher

407
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,335
It took this attic really is the is the big concern

408
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,919
The effects on the US economy could be coming from a lot of different angles

409
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,855
I feel like after the last one the last time Planet money did it similar show

410
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:34,463
Like everything was fine but I feel Almost sure that not everything is fine

411
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
Now

412
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
