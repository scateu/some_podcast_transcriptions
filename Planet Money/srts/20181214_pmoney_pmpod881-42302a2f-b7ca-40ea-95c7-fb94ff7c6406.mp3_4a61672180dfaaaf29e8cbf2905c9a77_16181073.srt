Hey it's Allie home here

8
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,872
The other day I did something we do all the

9
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,408
Time. When a bunny

10
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:20,736
I called up an expert to help me understand something

11
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:21,760
In this case

12
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,576
I called a fundraising expert Paul Edwards

13
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,112
Because I wanted to know

14
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,136
How do you ask

15
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
People for money

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,928
Have you raised

17
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,232
Billions of dollars in your life

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,304
That I help

20
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,376
In the campaign for the engage me have indeed raised

21
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
Billions of dollars

22
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:42,496
Paul's been doing this for decades helping universities other organizations raise money

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,824
I asked him how I might get you

24
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,920
R2 listener to support our journalism by going to donate

25

Dot NPR. Org / Planet Money

26
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
You told me about this theory of fundraising that has

27
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
To do with a

28
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,624
Hierarchy of questions

29
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,952
Because you got to know what different questions do

30
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,256
And you got to be able to use them all

31
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,536
At the lower end

32
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
The questions which

33
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,632
We might call them closed-ended questions

34
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424
Yes no

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Focus the conversation

36
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,008
But there are questions which are

37
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:20,384
Which who where when they're little higher up on the level those look at people

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,712
Thinking about their lives maybe even feeling some feelings

39
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,016
And then throw the most complex

40
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,160
Emotional questions of all top of the hierarchy are why questions

41
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,440
Why do you listen to Planet Money

42
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
Think about it

43
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
And then maybe go to donate

Flash Planet Money

46
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,728
There's something happening in China right now that revolves around

47
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
One particular company

48
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,312
And it tells us so much about the

49
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
Current trade fight with

50
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
China we've been following this

51
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,920
So closely and yet

52
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
We are still

53
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
So we called of NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz in the middle of the night to help us figure this out

54
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Robinson morning there

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
You just got in it is morning here I had to tell you about five times I tell the same thing over and over

56
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:14,656
We called Rob because of this story that starts at the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires

57
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704
Argentina on December

58
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,800
The leaders of the largest 20 economies on the planet that group of 20

59
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
The G20

60
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Get together

61
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
To work out different

62
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
Huge International

63
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:30,016
Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are sitting across from each other

64
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
Ready to

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
Talk trade War

66
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,648
Remember all the back-and-forth tariffs on Porkins

67
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:41,024
Steel I was paying attention to the bourbon and motorcycles in China

68
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:48,192
I'm looking at all the news wires and getting reports from other NPR reporters who are there and then suddenly the meat

69
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
Meeting is over

70
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
And the first thing I see

71
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Is

72
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,384
A statement from the Chinese government saying there is a truce people kiss in the streets

73
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
Have no

74
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504
Nobody is kissing in the streets

75
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
I think people were

76
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Kind of scratching their heads

77
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,648
That's what that was okay almost

78
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:12,000
The White House in China agreed to hold off on any new tariffs

79
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
490 days

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
While they try to reach

81
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:21,216
Meanwhile on the other side of the world something is happening that is putting the trade truce in danger that very day

82
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
December 1st

83
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
A woman

84
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,592
Is changing planes in Vancouver Canada

85
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
And she is arrested

86
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176
By Canadian authorities ended

87
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Detained

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
And this is

89
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,760
The Chief Financial Officer

90
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
Of Huawei

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808
One of China's

92
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
Largest and most

93
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Important comp

94
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,256
Huawei is an enormous company in China the largest Telecom equipment company in

95
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
The world it sells more phones

96
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
An apple

97
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:51,680
And the woman who was arrested among long show is not just a Chief Financial Officer

98
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
The company

99
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,544
She is the daughter of the founder this is like if Bill Gates his daughter was arrested

100
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,104
And Canada has arrested her on behalf

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Of the United

102
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:05,504
And at first no one really seems to know why she was arrested the Canadians won't say which is

103
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
Weird they're usually so nice

104
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
I'm surprised I didn't apologize to

105
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,000
So what are people saying like in China what is the coverage like does this seem like a big deal like

106
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,559
The Chinese State media

107
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Had a difficult

108
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
Time not seeing this as a

109
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,423
Politically motivated

110
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
Arrest us immediately felt like Trump doing something

111
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
China absolutely

112
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
It felt like the United States

113
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
Was taking

114
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,199
A very high-profile Chinese executive hostage

115
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,759
As part of a plan to

116
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,063
Put leverage on China during the trade talk

117
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
It looks to China

118
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Like a hostage

119
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,671

Called

140
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855

They are developing networks so good they are five g4g like what we have they went one better

143
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,887
But you don't really see Huawei phones in the US

144
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,935
Because the government doesn't want us to

145
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
To have them cell phone providers

146
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
Don't offer up Huawei phone

147
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
NS company explains so much about our current fight with China and even the story of capitalism in China and it was started by one guy

148
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,991
Ren zhengfei Ren zhengfei was born

149
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,783
In the poorest province

150
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
In China

151
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
He was born there in 1940

152
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
For just

153
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
Before communist

154
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
Took over China

155
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,255
He ended up going to a very good school for engineering

156
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,071
And then he joined Chinese Army

157
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
What stone is the people's Liberation Army on

158
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Are the pla

159
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,471
So how did it go from communist Army to founding

160
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Huawei

161
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
Is discharged and

162
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
He moves

163
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
To Shenzhen

164
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
Shenzhen at the

165
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
The time

166
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Was

167

This new economic zone

168
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
That was being set up

169
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
That would operate differently

170
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Wrestler Chyna

171
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
In that companies

172
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
You could have privatized company

173
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Chinese companies could

174
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Compete with each other

175
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
They weren't just Allstate

176
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
Companies in 1980

177
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
China sets aside a little chunk of

178
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
The country near Hong Kong

179
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
Draw the line around it and says

180
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Okay

181
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
Go try capitalism

182
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:11,871
Pierre it's called Ash engine special economic zone and it is a huge part of Chinese economic history

183
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,943
It's one of the first turns away from communism one of those

184
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
Pivotal moments that changed the neck

185
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015

188
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Is he goes there

189
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:26,975
And he raises around 21,000 Renminbi at the time that's around $2,000

190
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
And starts

191
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,839
His company called Huawei and grows and grows

192
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,423
It's one of the companies that turns China into the second largest economy in the world

193
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,055
And it is a perfect symbol of everything the China wants to be high-tech innovation

194
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Stampy Cat

195
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
It is a

196
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,663
Beautiful and very bizarre campus

197
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
There are different

198
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,783
Parts of a campus that are in different architectural styles

199
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
Example of one of the main buildings looks like the White House

200
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
What is this

201
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,695
A tribute to

202
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
America

203
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
I don't think it's

204
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,583
I think you'd have to ask when John feijoo does not talk to

205
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
To the Press but

206
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,399
At the time that it was built

207
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
This camp

208
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
I think that the United States

209
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
This was

210
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Aspirational

211
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
And

212
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
At that time a lot of

213
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
Different buildings in China were made to look like

214
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
Well-known buildings

215
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,039
It's just feels like an awkward building to have in the middle of your campus while your daughter is under arrest

216
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,391
Yeah but back then you know I don't think you know when one far away is stablished

217
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Just campus

218
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,559
You know the relationship between the US and China was fine which is so point that they literally have a White House in the middle of the camp

219
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,119
China wanted to learn from the US

220
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,679
That's what this experiment was all about in the US

221
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:45,823
One China to grow us was like we fought communism for years we want you to turn to capitalism

222
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:52,735
We think it'll make you turn to democracy and into an ally what's happening China is different

223
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,039
Where capitalism has not brought democracy

224
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
In China

225
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Is only

226
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
Kind of our Ally and more and more our rival

227
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,231
And yes technically Huawei is a private company but

228
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,047
In China nothing is really a private company

229
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,839
Exactly the way it is in the United States

230
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:14,495
Huawei like most large companies in the country has to have a Chinese Communist Party Committee inside the

231
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
So numbers of US Congress

232
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,895
Our little worried about Huawei this massive company

233
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Growing

234
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
It's faster than any other company

235
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
And making all of this telecommunications equipment

236
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,367
Why they might be under the thumb of the Communist Party

237
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
Even though they're private

238
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,303
2012 Commerce says no company that's employing Huawei technology should work with the US government

239
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
October

240
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,607
Of that year

241
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
US Congress

242
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
I issued a blistering

243
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
Bipartisan

244
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
Report

245
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
That

246
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,103
Accuse Huawei and its competitor in China.

247
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Te

248
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,431
Of being arms of the Chinese government

249
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,015
They also accused them of stealing intellectual property

250
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
American companies

251
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
And they accused them

252
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
Having the

253
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
That the potential

254
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Despite America

255
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Kids with their equipment

256
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,815
Congress is worried that Huawei is a straight up

257
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
Front for the Chinese government

258
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
But if America build cell towers used

259
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
Huawei technology

260
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,751
The Chinese government will use them to

261
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,567
Spion maybe everything in amer

262
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
And that's why you don't see much

263
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
Shuffle away stuff in the United

264
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
But there is still the

265
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
Rest of the world Huawei is

266
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,295
Is huge in Africa Europe the Middle East

267
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
It's in

268
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
170 countries

269
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,183
Including Iran here is where we get back to the arrest of mom

270
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
According to us authorities

271
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
Hmong had done business with

272
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
Iran while they were under sanction

273
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
About 10 years

274
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
And based on that

275
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,191
This past summer the US issued a warrant for

276
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
Was not made public

277
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
But the US toll Canada

278
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
She said that

279
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,591
Arrest her and send her to us

280
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
So when Mom gets off of

281
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,247
Cathay Pacific flight 838 in Vancouver on December 1st

282
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,599
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are there waiting

283
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
Looking for her in the mountains are there on behalf of United

284
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,767
And this is on the same day that Trump is sitting down across from Chinese president so

285
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
Trump and XI you're sitting at the

286
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Disabled

287
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
Meanwhile

288
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
The daughter

289
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
Of the founder of the second-largest

290
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,215
Company in China

291
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
Is being arrested

292
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Did Trump know

293
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,079
From what John Bolton told

294
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
NPR in

295
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
His exclusive interview with us

296
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
President Trump did not know

297
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:36,319
John Bolton is Trump's National Security advisor a real Hawk on China

298
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
Bolton himself said that he

299
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
He himself knew about it

300
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
But that

301
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
The president did not

302
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,839
The rest becomes public and the Chinese press goes while they say the United States are resorting to

303
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
Despicable hooligan

304
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
And China threatens Canada

305
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
What grave consequence

306
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
Mom is not freed immediately

307
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
And no one knows exactly what this

308
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
But everyone is pretty short

309
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
What is going to affect

310
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,919
The trade war is sitting in a Canadian jail and press

311
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Computers are like

312
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:07,807
We can't let her go on bail she has all the money in the world she's just going to get on a plane and leave

313
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
They argue about this

314
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,879
Her defense team says

315
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,695
Look she's got health problems she has hypertension

316
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
She's not a Flight Risk

317
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
+ +

318
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
If she

319
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Did Escape

320
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
Custody in Canada

321
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
And go back to China this would

322
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,007
This would mean that she would lose face for her

323
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Herself

324
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
For her father for a company

325
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
And for China

326
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,455
And then the defense lawyer proceeded to explain the concept of

327
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
Face

328
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
To the judge and

329
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
To the court

330
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
It was

331
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,623
I think a lot of China Watchers

332
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,439
Had a collective eye roll in response to

333
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
To this because

334
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
Oftentimes

335
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
You know this type of thing

336
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
The idea that the

337
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
Chinese are so mystically different from the rest of

338
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
The world

339
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,727
And that's only the Chinese would understand this

340
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
Is is commonly used as a

341
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Defense

342
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,359
Mumford up around 10 million Canadian dollars

343
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
To be let out on house arrest

344
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,319
She gets an ankle bracelet and she is now paying for her own surveillance at her fancy house in Vancouver

345
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,879
Canada will decide later whether or not.

346
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Turn her over to the US

347
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,975
And she's put under house arrest we start to see some of those

348
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
Grave

349
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
And they're real

350
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,327
On December 11th China takes Michael coverage

351
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
Former Canadian Diplomat into custody

352
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
And it looks exactly like

353
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
Retaliation

354
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
Can four monks arrest

355
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,007
Have a good night they take another Canadian indica

356
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Michael spafford

357
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
You going to take one

358
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,335
We're going to take two

359
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,663
That's a message that the Chinese would understand

360
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Immediately

361
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
Because this is exactly

362
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Play how

363
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,551
China's authoritarian government Opera

364
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:50,719
The United States doesn't really arrest random people or hand over prisoners when they're trying to settle trade disputes

365
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,303
That President Trump recently told Reuters that

366
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,119
He would intervene in Mom's case

367
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
If it would help trade negotiate

368
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
People

369
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
Went ballistic

370
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,311
Check the criminal justice system in the United States is totally

371
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
Not supposed to be a tool

372
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
Of the president

373
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,479
Definitely not a trade negotiating tool runs counter to

374
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
Just it is probably everything yeah

375
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
I can't

376
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,719
How much of this is just the inevitable clash between two giant economies and how much is this

377
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
Two people

378
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
She in the plaza

379
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,351
I think it's bigger than 2 personalities I think that she's even peeing

380
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
Is the

381
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
Face of a certain

382
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,471
Part of China that was always there

383
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
But he's just bringing it out

384
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:40,127
And this is not how China's former leaders like dumb shopping used to handle thing

385
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
You know

386
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:45,247
China for a long time operated under this Maxim

387
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
That was

388
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,599
Coined by former leader Deng Xiaoping and that was

389
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
Hide your strength

390
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
And baijiu

391
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Your time

392
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Hiding by

393
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
Which means basically

394
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Don't let

395
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
Other countries see

396
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
How far are you

397
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
You've come

398
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
And what you're capable of doing

399
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,263
Because it gives too much away

400
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,615
And xi jinping operates by completely different Principe

401
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
He wants to show the world that China

402
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Is

403
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
A force to be reckoned with

404
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
And that China is

405
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
Is actually a guiding

406
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Model

407
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Of what a country

408
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,671
That model is authoritarian

409
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
State-controlled capitalism

410
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Capitalism with Santa

411
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
Restrictions on freedoms

412
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,935
And the problem now is that there are two enormous countries that both want to be the guiding model for what a country

413
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Hangzhou and

To Canadian

415
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
So far

416
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,823
Are trapped in the middle

Thanks for listening

437
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:43,519
I think we should just Google and make sure something else hasn't happened because literally as every time I sit down something

438
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,127
It it's a good bet Something's Happened in the hour that we
