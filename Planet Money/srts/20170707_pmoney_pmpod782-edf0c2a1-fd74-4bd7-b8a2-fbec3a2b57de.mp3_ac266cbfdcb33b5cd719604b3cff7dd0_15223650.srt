Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
And I'm Jacob

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:27,392
Today on the show the entire federal budget

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,208
Every dollar the federal government spent last

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,256
3.9 trillion dollars

11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,048
We're going to do it in just

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,072
10 minutes

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:39,680
We're going to divide up our 10 minutes exactly the way the government divided up its butt

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,008
So the more money a program got from the federal government

15
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,544
The more time it's going to get

16
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,080
We are going to hit every

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
Social

18
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,128
Defense

19
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,432
Mowing the lawn at the White House everything

20
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,480
There's a poem

Okay here's how it's going to work

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
10 minutes on the clock

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
And we're going to cover the entire federal budget

32
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,120
Every second of that 10 minutes

33
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,680
Will be worth 6.4 billion dollars

34
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
So the small programs

35
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,984
Super Bass

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
Big programs nothing but time

37
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848
I'm going to bring in a bunch of people from planet money to help us out

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,200
So the first piece not show today Robert Smith is going to talk about Medicare and Medicaid

39
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,016
They got just over a trillion dollars that is

40
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
29% of

41
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
The federal budget

42
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,136
So they will get 29% of our 10 minutes

43
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
Start the clock

44
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Now

45
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
This debate

46
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:11,328
About whether the federal government should have a responsibility to pay for healthcare

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
Well I got news

48
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
It already.

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,984
The federal government pays for the Healthcare of 120

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Million America

51
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,848
People over the age of 65 families with low income

52
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
People with long term disability

53
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,920
They're all covered

54
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
My medicare

55
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
And Medicaid

56
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
Medicaid and Medicare

57
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
Although I always mix them up

58
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
Everyone.

59
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,648
Item embarrassing errors when I was a new health policy reporter wear out

60
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
Mistake these in stories

61
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
Lots of people sent me angry emails

62
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:43,584
This is Sarah Kliff a writer for vox.com she co-hosts the weeds podcast

63
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,192
I heard a terrible way to remember it's all ages ago someone told me

64
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,264
You care for the old and Aid the sick

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,568
Are no Aid the poor that's what to see if it's

66
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
Lipids chemical lab

67
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,896
Okay I have a better one

68
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
Silver hair

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Medicare

70
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
Underpaid

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Medicaid

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
If we live long enough we all get Medicare

73
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,696
But even if you don't consider yourself poor you might also find yourself on

74
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Medicaid

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,048
Actually finances a lot of long-term nursing homes days

76
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,192
So a lot of middle upper class Americans eventually do end up on Medicaid when they need

77
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,264
That kind of coverage and they're kind of whittled away their savings

78
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
And there you have it

79
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
HTC how much time do I have left

80
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,384
You got about a minute and a half

81
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Men and a half

82
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,760
Yeah you guys this is the big this is the biggest part of the body you got some time

83
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
Okay let's go get some coffee

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,368
What's the time

85
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,720
We have some fun and I can explain one more thing about Medicaid

86
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:48,608
Okay so we all heard about Obamacare we've all heard about how in Congress right now the Republican

87
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,168
Heartland doing Obamacare

88
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,216
What the fight is really about

89
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
Is the future

90
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,568
Of the four guys were talking about the future of Medicaid

91
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,592
Underpaid

92
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Underpay

93
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
You want sugar to cup

94
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
A black coffee please

95
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,992
What is a big waste of Barack Obama

96
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,064
Got people insured was to expand Medicaid

97
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,136
Medicaid costs are shared between the federal government and state

98
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
States run the program

99
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Essentially said

100
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,791
We are going to give you more Federal money a larger share of our budget

101
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
If you discover more people

102
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
Answer this this

103
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
Part of the budget pie I'm talking my way through this. Large

104
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,591
So many Republicans are thinking about how do we undo Obamacare what they thought is let's put some cat

105
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
Undergrowth

106
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
Of Medicaid

107
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,759
And what that means insert real-world terms is it if Republican plan passes

108
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
15 million

109
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
Fewer people covered by Medicaid

110
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,391
So we're going to do the show again in 10 years

111
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
There might be slightly less time for government

112
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
No coffee break

113
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
Maybe time for a short

114
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
You going to drink that by the way

115
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
No

116
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,703
Transportation 2% of the budget

117
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
Kenny Malone

118
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,287
We asked former secretary Ray lahood to write a haiku

119
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
Decline so I made one for him

120
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
Using words from his old

121
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
Oh Highway crumbles

122
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
Nisar Wheels

123
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
One big pothole

124
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
It spreads

125
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Cross

126
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
The roads

127
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
Thank you all very much thank you very much

128
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
Next up Social Security

129
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
It accounts for 24% of federal spending

130
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
Jacob take it away

131
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,303
Social Security is really big

132
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,607
Because almost everybody gets it

133
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,423
In particular almost every American

134
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
Over the age of 66

135
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
Including billionaires

136
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,079
You know if Warren Buffett wants Social Security he can get it

137
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
I called

138
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
Ted marmor to ask about this

139
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,199
Is an Emeritus professor at Yale expert answers

140
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
Why does Warren Buffett

141
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
Get Social Security

142
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
That's a classic dumbbell

143
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,415
Under couch formulation

144
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,975
Okay mama said billionaires getting social

145
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
Security it's not a bug

146
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
It's a feature

147
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,119
When Social Security was created back in the thirties some Democrats did one

148
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
Creative version of the program

149
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
Where the money just went to Port

150
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
But President Roosevelt was like no

151
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,055
Program like that just won't survive Politico

152
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,151
What we need is something that almost all working people are eligible

153
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
Andy said we should find it with a special pass

154
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
Acts that almost all working people pay

155
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
That way people will say

156
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
I paid into social

157
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623
Security I deserve social

158
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
Security when I retire

159
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,487
And I will vote out-of-office any politician who tries to

160
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
Take it away from me

161
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791
Terms

162
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
Emoji Express

163
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
What's God damn it I'm going to be

164
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,935
I'm going to be sure to have a program that no damn concur

165
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,263
Is going to mess with because people are going to feel

166
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
Entitled

167
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,871
But I do think it leads to a lot of confusion

168
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
You know people seem to think

169
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
Oh I contributed

170
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,759
Social Security they're holding onto my money in a special box

171
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
This is not how it work

172
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:51,647
My money is paying for retired people right now and I'm crossing my fingers

173
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,207
Bet in 30 years when I retired there will be

174
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
40 roads were paying me

175
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
Chicken

176
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,399
I'll bet you any money and I want you to pay me off by putting it in my grave

177
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
The probability that you

178
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Will receive

179
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
Social Security benefits for retirement

180
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
Is so hot

181
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,151
That you would should be declared irrational

182
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
The bleeding song

183
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,503
Why am I confident

184
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,879
Why am I so, cuz I understand the political economy of the United States because Roosevelt was right

185
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:28,767
Truck because almost everybody pays in and gets paid out including billionaires

186
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,095
Merced Social Security is politically Bulletproof

187
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
Social services and education

188
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
3%

189
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:41,055
And for the segment we wanted to get someone who is currently a beneficiary of public education

190
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
AKA

191
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Jacob's kit

192
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151
The spending in this area

193
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
Comes from

194
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,479
State and local governments

195
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,551
The federal government bid

196
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
Biggest education line

197
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
I don't

198
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,975
Is grants for low-income College

199
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
National Defense is

200
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
15% of federal spending

201
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
Stacy

202
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,447
We spend one and a half billion dollars every day on.

203
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,031
And this is famously one of the most controversial part 2

204
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
Democrats often come in and

205
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
Cut defense spending

206
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,383
Republicans come in and

207
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
Raise defense spending

208
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
What's the power in spite of all of this

209
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
If you look back over the last

210
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,831
20 years the share of the budget devoted to defense

211
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
It's not really changed

212
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
That much

213
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
And actually

214
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
That's pretty much true for most

215
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Of the federal budget

216
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
It stays pretty steady

217
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
And I was

218
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
Totally shocked by this so I talked to this guy Bill Valdez about it he work for the energy department for more than 20 years ago

219
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Out of budget

220
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
And he told me his theory of what's going on here

221
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,615
Yeah the real thing that keeps the budget stable is that

222
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,663
There are all these special interest

223
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
Hundreds of lobbyists

224
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,551
Battling for government funds hammering out deals with different states

225
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
Indifferent politicians

226
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,903
Deuces the budget status quo is really this

227
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
Hard-earned equilibrium

228
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,279
This is a good thing ultimately it increased stability

229
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,863
Do we actually have lobbyists to thank for our stable budget

230
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
In many respects yeah

231
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
It's like a little shout-out to the

232
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
The lobbyist

233
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
Well I mean I feel like that's okay right don't you think maybe the budget should be their Valentine

234
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:26,271
President Trump has proposed increasing defense spending by cutting other parts

235
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
The budget

236
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
Bill says he will have to get through the lobbyists

237
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
First

238
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Next up

239
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Income

240
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Security

241
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
13% of the budget

242
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
Here is Noel

243
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,607
Yes income security so think of this as programs for poor people

244
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
It includes a bunch of different things like

245
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
The Earned Income Tax Credit

246
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,055
Housing assistance unemployment foster care is a small part of it

247
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,383
I'm going to talk about food stamps which are officially known as

248
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Snap for two reasons

249
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
I'm on food stamps were really big

250
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,759
Program usage Spike

251
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,623
During the recession if you look at graphs it's basically like a straight line going up

252
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
And he stayed pretty high

253
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,255
More than 40 million people are getting food stamps right now

254
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,583
And I think there's a lot of confusion over who gets them

255
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
So it's clear that up

256
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,423
Two out of every three people on food stamps are kids

257
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
The elderly or they are.

258
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
All of the rest

259
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:23,359
It's roughly split between people who are working but making very low wages low enough

260
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Qualify for food stamps

261
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
And

262
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,735
People who are not working but should be working soon

263
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,807
Because snap comes with work

264
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,903
For the most part if you are able-bodied and you don't have a job

265
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,719
You get cut off from Food Stamps after a couple of months

266
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Interest on the national debt

267
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,583
6% of the budget

268
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,887
You can look at this in two ways

269
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
Once interest rates are really low right now

270
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
I hope so the government was able to borrow money

271
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
Spending on goods and services for Americans great

272
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,895
But you could also say this whole chunk of the budget

273
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Is just the

274
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
Interest on all the money we owe

275
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,039
And what we get in return for all this money is

276
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,319
Nothing

277
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Four more seconds

278
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Just feeling awkward

279
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Veterans Affairs

280
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
5%

281
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Sally Helm

282
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,263
They provide things like health care and disability benefits for vets

283
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
President Trump wants to boost funding for the VA but is proposing Some Cuts including one for disabled vets when they're old

284
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Enough to get Social Security

285
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
President Eisenhower try to do something kind of like this in the 50s he was a five-star general so maybe he thought he could get away with it

286
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
But he got totally shut down by Congress

287
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
International Affairs 1%

288
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:48,863
Nick Fountain go this goes to operating US embassies and consulates throughout the world

289
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,167
Providing military assistance to allies

290
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,007
Eating developing me everything else makes up about 3% of the budget

291
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,407
Was bringing Justice FBI DEA prisons Homeland Security

292
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:06,783
Community and Regional development

293
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
So we made it through the whole budget

294
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,951
I in 10 minutes and I have to see

295
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,767
The thing that strikes me about the budget

296
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
Is it

297
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,119
Half of it more than half of it is just made up by three program

298
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,447
Medicare Medicaid and Social Security and then in the rest

299
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
Overwhelmingly the biggest trunk is defense

300
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,127
Until there is this old line that I still love which is the federal government is basically

301
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,687
A big insurance company backed by a large standing on

302
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,039
We really did Cover almost the entire budget like this is almost everything we spend money

303
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,135
Except it's not the whole budget

304
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Gone

305
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,743
There is a part of the budget that is known as the black budget

306
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
The black budget

307
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
Yes what is the black budget

308
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
The black budget

309
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,727
Jacob we will talk about the Bible come on

Give me the black budget

322
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:30,751
The black budget I talked to Lindsey Koshgarian who is the research director at the national priorities project and ask her

323
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
What it is

324
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
So the black budget is

325
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Part of the federal budget

326
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
That is

327
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
Devoted to National Security it's

328
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Top secret

329
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,551
IMovie says that most of what we know about the black budget

330
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
Comes from the Edward Snowden leak

331
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
In 2013

332
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,439
So it includes things like the CIA

333
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
Secret agent

334
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
Strong program

335
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
The national

336
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,863
Security Agency and a bunch of other secret agent

337
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,911
Type stuff so this is all

338
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:04,287
Hidden off the bike so when you took your spreadsheets and spent a week trying to do the math for the show

339
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,591
All this stuff you're describing is not

340
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
In those

341
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
Spreadsheets not on those pie charts

342
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
It's secret money it's secret money

343
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,527
So far for all of this do we know how much

344
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,367
How much money the government spends

345
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,951
But there was kind of an unofficial official number floating around of

346
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,999
Half a billion dollars

347
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,327
And then the Snowden leak came out and we learned that it were

348
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
Was a lot more than that

349
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
It's about

350
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
70

351
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Billion

352
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,799
Oh that's profound

353
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
70 billion epithets

354
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
About 2% of the budget

355
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
But I mean

356
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,223
That number is from a few years ago and to be honest

357
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
We really don't know

358
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
How big the black budget

359
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:02,143
