Alright Alex I have you here where are we

8
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:20,480
Block away from her office at a liquor store

9
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,552
Take you on a field trip because we are doing

10
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,856
The rest of the story summer edition

11
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,672
I love this is what my favorite episodes for we revisit past

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,536
Episodes and we find out what has happened since we are done we bring you updates

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,608
And I gathered because you brought me to a liquor store

14
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:41,216
They were going to revisit the episode we did on vodka yes you are correct

15
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,056
So remind us what was that episode about

16
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,616
Is there really a difference between

17
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
Cheap vodka and expensive vodka and no not really is what we came down to

18
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:58,112
Hanging you claim that when you drink Vodka cheap vodka

19
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,648
You get flushed cheeks butt

20
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,488
When you drink Vodka during that episode your cheeks did not get flesh

21
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,280
I will concede that is

22
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,328
How that episode ended

23
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:12,704
So we thought you might be making it up about this cheap vodka allergy maybe it's just in your head

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,848
But then after the episode aired we got all these emails from listeners who were like no no this happens to me too with vodka

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,224
Three-sided we're going to give you another chance to prove that the Vodka allergy is real

26
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,296
I am grateful that I'm getting a chance to redeem myself

27
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
Alright well listen we are serious journalists here at Planet Money so we are going to fact check your claim here

28
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,256
And if you're right if your cheeks to get flushed

29
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
We will correct the record

30
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120

Alright already

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,968
Okay but I don't want you to have to drink alone so I invited someone here to drink with you

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,016
Okay I'm very intrigued

Good Sam email listener

40
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,864
He said that he also gets these flash red cheeks from vodka

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
The trouble is real

42
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936

56

78
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,680
Haband and you've been with us here at Planet Money this summer

79
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
But

80
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:57,056
Your day job is to be NPR's food and farming correspondence that I was absolutely fascinated

81
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,104
Obsessed actually with the storyline

82
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
Last year reminds listeners

83
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,456
If they did not hear the original episode what what have

84
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
Basically a fight broke out beat

85
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
Farmers over weeds

86
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,624
Epsom farmers were killing their weeds with this

87
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,184
Pesticide a weed killer called Dyke

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
Timbuk

89
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,536
It worked for them because they were growing these special new soybeans

90
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
That could survive. Cambage

91
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,215
But I can't burp that this chemical they're using it has a big problem which is it blows away

92
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
It can just evaporate after you spray it

93
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
Any kind of drifts

94
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Across the lands

95
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
Which is why at the time we did that episode

96
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,687
It was actually illegal to use that camera that

97
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
That's why these farmers

98
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,527
We're breaking the law and I Campbell was

99
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,343
Damaging crops and neighbors Fields provoking

100
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Fights

101
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
And there was a murder

102
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,951
And what happened with that murder case

103
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,279
A man named Alan Curtis Jones went on trial he claimed self

104
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
Defense about the jury

105
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
Buy it

106
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,399
They found him guilty of second-degree murder he was sentenced to

107
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
224 years in

108
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,775
And the other thing that happened was the pesticide companies said they fixed

109
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,311
Static ham butt so it wouldn't

110
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,127
So it became legal to spray last

111
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,687
Thousands of farmers started using Zicam

112
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,735
And maybe it wasn't fixed

113
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
Millions of Acres of crops were.

114
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,671
And it was most intense in Arkansas that's where the problem was the worst that's also where the murder happened

115
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,255
And there it all landed in the lap of a regulatory body called the

116
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
The Arkansas state

117
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
This is kind of like

118
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
The pesticide police in Arkansas

119
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,423
They have a lot of power but these are just

120
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
Regular citizen

121
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,519
Who have regular lives like one I met his name

122
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,567
Terry Fuller he runs a farm supply Paso

123
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,127
So are people coming to you and saying it

124
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
Got to do something

125
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
Absolutely

126
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
Farmers

127
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
Town people community people

128
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
Lined up

129
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,671
We had as many as 15 people at the office before 7 in the morning

130
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,975
On two or three different occasions

131
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Always

132
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,071
All waiting to see me and never feels

133
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
Serta personally threatened it

134
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,935
Somewhat there's two loaded guns in my office

135
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
And I don't need to chamber a round

136
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
I feel personally threatened somewhat

137
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
And and what they decided

138
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:15,551
How to do was to actually go back to AB and basically say until you can figure out a way to pray

139
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
Prevent this damage

140
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
No farmer in Ark

141
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,671
Consult during the summer when the weather is hot in this

142
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Is drift happens

143
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,023
No Farmers allowed to spray dicamba on their crops

144
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Okay so no farmers are

145
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
Sprained I can buy in Arkansas

146
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
That was the

147
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Plant

148
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
Just last week

149
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
I called Terry Fuller back

150
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,543
I said well is it working and he was not a happy

151
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
There's at least 5000 Acres of soybeans in Phila

152
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Holmes County vet

153
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
Show symptomatology

154
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
Oh wow

155
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,527
Curled up leaves stunted growth

156
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Was crazy this was just

157
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
Not supposed to happen this year

158
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,183
Not supposed to happen this year scribs Luli correct

159
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
So people break in the lobby

160
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
Apparently

161
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,143
It seems like those volunteer Regulators in Arkansas have not managed

162
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,471
The problem the company said they were going to fix it they don't seem to have

163
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
The problem

164
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,079
So this is going to land in front of the Environmental Protection Agency

165
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,431
At the federal government level to see whether they are going to let this product stay on the market

166
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,807
Oh okay alright we'll keep an eye on Weeds and before you leave then I want you to settle something for it

167
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,135
We got literally hundreds if not thousands of tweets and emails

168
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
Challenging us

169
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,255
It's on our use of the word pesticide in the original episode

170
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:34,143
Can you please settle this debate for us pesticides include both insecticides and herbicides

171
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,239
Herbicides are a form of pesticide we can use pesticide

172
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
So please no more Tweets in email

173
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
We are all correct in this

174
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Situation

175
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
I think Stan my pleasure

176
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:50,015
We have Sally Helm in the studio

177
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,039
Hi Sally

178
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
So a couple of months ago

179
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
You and Kenny Malone today

180
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,671
A great episode about the smoot-hawley Tariff

181
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
And I'm so sorry what

182
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,999
Something like 90 years old now we did

183
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
I expect to have an update on

184
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
We did not

185
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,375
Just a reminder the smoot-hawley Tariff swear these

186
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Protectionist

187
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,191
Tariffs that Economist generally agree

188
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
We're up there

189
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
We called the episode

190
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,079
Worst terrorist ever it's number 833

191
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,663
And after aired we got an email from a listener

192
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,967
Who we were not expecting

193
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Down there

194
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,111
Great Wolf first I have to have you introduce yourself so what is your full name

195
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,695
My name is Austin Smoot

196
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
Waitts Lake smooth

197
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
Smoot-hawley yes

198
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Senator Reed Smoot

199
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
Who was one of the people responsible for the Tariff Act

200
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Is Austin's

201
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
Great great

202
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:45,311
Grandfather's brother okay so did Austin know about the skeletons in his family's closet heat did not know about

203
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
Until he was in college

204
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,151
Sitting in an intro economics class

205
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,455
During a class discussion I raise my hand

206
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
And I asked a question I

207
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Don't even

208
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,319
McCall what I asked but Professor goes down

209
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
Great question

210
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
What did you say your name was

211
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
And I responded

212
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
Austin Austin smoke

213
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Nissan Leaf pause

214
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,095
I need scanned over the whole classroom

215
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,703
And there was a big class we probably like a hundred hundred fifty kids as well as big Auditorium one

216
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,543
And a little grin on his face and he just says

217
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Smooth

218
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,407
Trying to learn basic economic I've never heard of such a thing

219
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
He was expecting that the class was just going to erupt

220
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
Did this amazing Joker he just told

221
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
But fortunately

222
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,207
An intro to economics course so there was

223
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,743
Silence

224
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
Looking for Alexa

225
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Yeah they did no idea

226
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Okay so his

227
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
Professors told the nerdiest

228
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
File jokes

229
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
Is this house

230
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:48,543
He finds out yeah he goes home after the classy shirts Googling he ends up Googling for hours reading about the

231
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,823
Hawley tariff act

232
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
And he actually had a

233
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,223
Paper due soon after this for the class and he writes about the smoot-hawley Tariff Act

234
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
Turned it in early cuz he's so into it

235
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,343
And Donnelly. Karen as a result of this

236
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
Experience Austin Smoot

237
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,951
Changes his major from electrical engineering

238
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:12,095
To finance and economics wow did you switch your major to sort of

239
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
A town

240
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,519
Exactly I'm out I'm trying to make up for the name and save my children

241
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,871
Because I'm sure they're going to sit down one day and an economics class and when they call the roll

242
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,943
The exact same thing is going to happen that I've no doubt

243
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:33,343
That Professor from Austin's econ 101 class he actually ended up hiring Austin to work at

244
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
Economic think-tank

245
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,999
Often did that little while now he is an accounting analyst in Salt Lake City Utah

246
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,143
All right we'll see if he can clear the family name thanks Sally thanks Karen

247
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,751
For this next update I want you to take your mind back to episode

248
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
816

249
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
Cub Bitcoin losers

250
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
We told the story of this guy named

251
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Sell hookah

252
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
Some Bitcoin back when it was cheap

253
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Got to write down the keys so

254
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
She could not

255
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Access is Bitcoin

256
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575
And we tried to help him find it

257
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
Did not find it

258
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
Is not that he did find it

259
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
But we did get this one email after

260
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
The story ran and are

261
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
Beloved internet Aviva dekornfeld

262
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,911
I was reading through these emails and she flagged it for us in

263
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,215
And she's actually back here as a producer with us

264
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
Today in the studio glow Aviva

265
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
Hey Karen

266
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
Okay so the listener

267
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,615
Who emailed us her name is Marissa Mini

268
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,687
And when she sent this she was in the middle of this big

269
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
From New York to LA

270
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,039
And while she was packing up she of course

271
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:40,159
Was listening to Planet Money all right good where she heard our reporter Kenny Malone helping sell

272
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,207
Rummage through his attic for his loss

273
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,535
And hearing this episode she remembered like

274
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
I bought cryptocurrency

275
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
A few months ago

276
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
And I also

277
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,447
Did she do it still did she forget to write down her

278
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
Kind of the opposite

279
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
She bought the cryptocurrency

280
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
And I wrote on the speaker

281
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
Can my very very very bad hemorrhoid

282
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
It's case sensitive

283
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
And it's $20

284
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
Okay so she wrote it down

285
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
But

286
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
Reader on hand

287
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Okay so apparently

288
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
We need to add one more piece of

289
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
Advice write it down

290
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Legibly exactly

291
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
So one of the lessons of the Bitcoin loser

292
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,791
Episode was that crypto is never really lost

293
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
The consultants make this

294
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,143
It's claimed that if you have even part of your key then

295
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,239
Are these people called Bitcoin hunters and they can help you figure out your whole key and act

296
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Chester Wallace

297
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
I'm so nervous I heard this

298
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
An email Kenny and said

299
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
Do you know anyone who

300
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Can possibly help

301
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Antonis like

302
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
Yeah here's this website and it leads her

303
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
This guy name

304
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
Bitcoin

305
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
Like his screen name.

306
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
Professional name Hunter

307
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Says

308
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,535
Send me all of your information

309
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
You have every bit of your illegible

310
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Kian doll

311
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,703
And where our Consultants right was it enough just to have like a few letters and numbers

312
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,007
Bitcoin Dave was able to

313
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
How to unlock mirror

314
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Wallet

315
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
She got back over $40,000

316
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
Minus

317
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
What's 15% cut

318
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
For doing all the hard way

319
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
Loud nice work honey Malone

320
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,391
And Bitcoin Dave I'll have to see you going Dave

321
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
Thanks of you guys thank you

322
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:24,351
For this next one we are going to take you on an economic scavenger hunt

323
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,959
This comes from an episode of we did a couple of months ago where we took questions from listeners

324
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,031
Including this question from Alistair name Brian Knowles

325
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,823
Who asked us to explain this

326
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
Very obscure economic

327
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Term witch

328
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
Giffen good

329
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,223
And we brought in the great Patty Hearst to help us

330
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
Explain it he is here

331
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
The great Patty Hearst thank you

332
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,671
You are here with us to sort of your on the other side of the country at NPR West

333
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
And you are the editor of our daily

334
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
Play podcast

335
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
Indicator

336
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
Yes giffen Goods

337
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Just to remind everybody

338
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,607
Is a staple commodity

339
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,911
Betsy's increasing levels of demand

340
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
Even as its price Rises

341
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,847
Which defies like the most fundamental laws of Economics right literally was like a unicorn of economic

342
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
Alright usually after

343
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
The price of something Rises

344
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Demond

345
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
Sleep.

346
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:15,039
Because consumers get ticked off at paying the high price and they buy cheaper alternate

347
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
Okay and your contention was that they

348
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,391
They used to exist but they don't anymore

349
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
Exactly there are so many alternatives

350
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
Every commodity

351
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
That we have particularly in the developed

352
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
There really aren't any giffen goods

353
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
That's my content

354
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,375
Okay well our listeners have

355
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
A beef with that

356
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
We asked them

357
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,567
Can you send us your ideas for giffen goods and we got a

358
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
A ton of answers

359
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
Some of them I think

360
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
We can fairly safe

361
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Please say do not qualify

362
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
If I like

363
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Cheetos

364
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
Bison tongue

365
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
People also sent in

366
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
Like smartphones and

367
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Subway

368
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,671
Some of the things they sent it I think they might

369
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Actually qualify

370
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Why so I have

371
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
Asked you Patty

372
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,071
To accept the solemn responsibility of deciding

373
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Standing in judgment

374
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
On whether or not

375
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
These are in fact

376
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,007
I hate to think of the idea what I mean judgmental towards our listeners but

377
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
I don't know

378
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,335
Alright okay alright so

379
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
We have from our listener back

380
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
Premium coffee

381
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,223
Premium coffee okay Cassie.

382
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,063
Yet the price of premium coffee goes up and therefore demand goes up so the

383
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Took up together

384
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,367
Okay I can see that I make

385
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
The problem is its premium coffee

386
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Rite Aid Sonora Staples

387
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:31,583
If it was if it was Folgers or instant I could see that but this is not even a stand there all sorts of Alternatives any

388
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
I'm sorry does not qualify

389
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,167
Alright hipsters if you have hate mail send it

390
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
10 directly to patio

391
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:42,079
Okay so this next one I had not heard about until gave Robitussin about

392
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Toilet paper

393
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,895
He said that there was this huge

394
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,199
Toilet paper shortage in Taiwan in March

395
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
Because home prices were going up and

396
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
Manufacturers were sitting there with that

397
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,111
Toilet paper prices were going to go up so there was like this

398
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
Huge Panic buying

399
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
Toilet paper

400
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
I know about this

401
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,071
And indeed there was a run on toilet

402
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
My people will literally buying up

403
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Traits of it

404
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
In the stores

405
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Crazy

406
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
Okay but here's the thing

407
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,031
Yes but price did not rise

408
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,079
All right so that the reason the Panic was created

409
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
People are expecting the

410
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,223
I actually didn't say the Panic was in fear of the high prices that never materialized

411
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
Prices actually stayed the same

412
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
So you get two or three

413
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,135
Okay just the idea of a toilet paper shortage

414
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
This is making me feel like

415
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,999
Okay I have one final contender

416
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
And this came

417
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
In various forms from Lotto

418
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Two different people

419
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
Healthcare so

420
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
People say

421
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,471
Fenton like Niche drugs or emergency care but the

422
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
The one that I think might

423
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Actually work

424
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Basic health

425
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Okay

426
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,919
Remember with a giffen good with talking about a staple with a price

427
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
Rises in the demand Rises

428
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
At the same time and it's because

429
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
You're giving up alternatives to notice.

430
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Take the cheaper option

431
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,343
So I guess maybe

432
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
If you think about you

433
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,183
Looking after your health maybe you're giving up vacation in order to make sure

434
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
You get good health care that you

435
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
You're treated well

436
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:09,119
I could see that as a possible yeah I mean I pretty I think we have to take that apart a little bit but I think that's a really interesting

437
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
Wanted to look at I would say

438
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
We have a definite contender

439
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,103
Oh my goodness finally we have a winner basic Healthcare Patty is going to accept that is

440
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,503
I'm going to let you know I'm going to look into it but I'm certainly willing to open the door to it yet thank you so much

441
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,903
Ducati my pleasure, thanks for having me after the break we will return to Alex and our listeners Sam who had

442
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,207
Faithfully been drinking vodka

443
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,279
Paternalism back from the liquor store hanging out in the office

444
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,863
And I will fact check whether or not their cheeks to get flushed

445
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239

Everyone grab a mic

468
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
I have answers

469
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
I'm very excited about this

470
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:30,527
I wanted to know if a doctor could explain this alleged cheap vodka allergy so I called one up

471
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,159
I'm Heather Linebarger and I'm a physician and who else are you a former roommate

472
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
That's right that she explained to me that

473
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,487
But the liver

474
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
Prince alcohol

475
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,351
And it's something that's really close to formaldehyde

476
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Wow

477
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,263
Which can kind of make you flush and not feel good this is like the thing that you used in science class where you would like

478
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
Pyside cats exactly

479
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,103
And if you don't have enough of the

480
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
This one particular enzyme that

481
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
Get rid of formaldehyde

482
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
The formaldehyde might hang out

483
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
Anybody interior

484
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,551
And genetically Asian

485
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
People

486
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:08,415
Tend to have less of that particular enzyme so this is sometimes called Asian

487
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
Flash

488
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,975
Richard got a ton of emails about

489
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
This one but since you're

490
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,047
White that one is probably not it

491
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,375
There is one theory that Heather thought might be

492
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,959
The reason why this is happening to you and it actually kind of validates something that

493
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,007
The scientist in your episode said

494
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
Which is the cheap vodka

495
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,639
Might not distill out all the extra byproducts of whatever it's made out of light

496
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
Potatoes or whatever

497
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
Vodka from what I understand can come from

498
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Any kind of stuff

499
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,295
If you let it from Atlanta

500
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
Valkyrie

501
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
Sakana totally is

502
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
In my guess

503
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
Best would be your boss

504
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
Does having more of an allergy

505
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
To the other

506
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
Kind of broken down

507
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
Stop

508
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
The furthermore

509
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,655
Important question

510
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,703
Which is did your cheeks get flushed

511
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,007
Let me just take a look

512
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,591
Oh yeah yeah yeah there's a little flesh

513
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
You look like a like one

514
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
Someone put like one round of blush

515
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
Yeah I don't know

516
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,039
Evaluate like

517
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,135
Round blush a little blush but like no one's going to be like oh my God hold off on

518
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,743
I think this means we do need to correct the record

519
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,815
I think we can say that your alleged flash is real

520
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
Very Vindicated right now

521
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
I definitely do

522
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:30,079
Yashow Vindicated my feelings salsa that makes me feel really good

523
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
I think that wraps up the rest of the story

524
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,759
