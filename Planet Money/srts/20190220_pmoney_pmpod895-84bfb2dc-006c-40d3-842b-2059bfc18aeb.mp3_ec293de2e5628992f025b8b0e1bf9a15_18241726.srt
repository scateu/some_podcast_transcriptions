1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:02,816
This episode is part 2 of

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:04,096
But I at least I'm calling

3
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,120
The antitrust

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,168
And so Jacob Goldstein

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,984
I want you to imagine the words were about to say

6
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,008
Read the text.

7
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,800
Crawls across the screen

8
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,080
At the beginning of Star Wars

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:21,504
A little more than a hundred years ago the US government broke up the standard welcome

10
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
That was this

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,112
Essential early moment when the government stepped into the free market

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,952
Because it's not a big company was doing things that were bad for company

13
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,000
In the decades after that

14
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,048
The government got more and more aggressive

15
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,608
It intervened in the free market more and more

16
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144
Until eventually

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,168
There was a backlash

18
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,728
Today's episode is about that backlash

19
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,752
And the man who made it home

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,456
Ladies and gentlemen is my privilege denied my very great privilege

21
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,320
Introduce one of the great constitutionalists about day The Honorable Robert Bork

22
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,672
This is from a speech a judge named Robert Bork gated in 1980s

23
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:06,304
Thank you can I was a poor signature look with this sort of Shaggy 19th century Style

24
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,376
Before we started working on these shows about Aunt

25
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,936
The thing that I knew about Robert Bork

26
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,240
Was that he was nominated to the Supreme Court

27
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:19,360
And rejected because Democratic senators did not like his long history of

28
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
Very conservative

29
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
Opinions on subjects like abortion

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
And civil rights

31
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,760
And when he died in 2012

32
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,320
That is the subject that his obituaries were

33
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,136
But there is something else about 4

34
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
But you don't hear as much

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,256
All these Reflections are prompted by the history of antitrust law

36
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
When I first started at Yale

37
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
I really thought

38
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,680
The situation of the law was hopeless

39
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:48,544
Robert Bork completely transformed the way antitrust law Works in this

40
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,384
He changed the very definition of what's legal and illegal

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
For Big Comfy

42
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,176
To do I mean

43
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
It changed it so much

44
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,016
It is shocking it is still the same law

45
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,576
And it seems like even Bourque with surprise

46
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,600
Body impact

47
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
The fact is

48
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,208
I simply underestimated the power of ideas

49
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,536
Now that's a very natural error for a professor

50
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,704
If you sit in enough faculty meetings

51
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,032
You are very like it underestimate the power of thought

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,944
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm taking Colton and I'm Kenny Malone

Today on the show how Robert Bork won the fight over the very meaning of competition in America

54
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,392
How to pave the way for some of the biggest most

55
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
Powerful companies

00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,840
Sister political views are significantly more liberal than Robert

00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Works opposite

Very very nice very cordial very witty

73
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,824
Eleanor Fox started practicing law in 1960

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
Right around the time Robert Bork started

75
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Teaching at Yale

76
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
And you found your way to anti

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
Frustrate you became an antitrust

78
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah it sounds it sounds

79
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
Luckily it founded

80
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
Why was luckily

81
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
Cuz I love it

82
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
Why do you love antitrust

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,120
But I loved David against Goliath and David against Goliath which side did you root for

84
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,424
Oh David

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
David and Goliath

86
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
So

87
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,752
Take B classic

88
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,056
From the first episode of this series

89
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,104
Goliath was Standard Oil

90
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,944
The giant Oil Company controlled by one of the richest men in the

91
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
David

92
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
With a little startup refiners

93
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
Standard oil bottle

94
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,392
Or forced out of business in order to gain control of 90% of

95
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Have the refining biz

96
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
We just did a whole show on

97
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,791
What was the antitrust worldview when you started practicing in the night

98
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,887
It was for the little guy without power

99
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,191
It was the suspicion that when big

100
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
Firms did

101
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
Anything that made life

102
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
Tough work

103
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
Editor

104
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:35,199
That was probably illegal and you can really see this in this moment the 19th 6

105
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
The Supreme Court

106
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
Pushing antitrust

107
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
Further and further

108
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,367
Case-by-case in 1960

109
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
T2 Brown Shoe Company versus the United States

110
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,999
Tennis shoe company buy up a chain of shoe store

111
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Supreme Court was like

112
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
No

113
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,655
That shoe company would just kick the other shoe brands out of those chain stores no

114
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
Can't do it 1966

115
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,239
United States vs Vons grocery

116
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,823
Hand to local grocery store chains merge in Los

117
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
I don't know

118
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,943
Merger after the merger they'd only have seven and a half percent

119
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
The local market

120
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Supreme Court was like

121
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,575
No you can't do it would be too hard on Mom and Pop shops

122
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
Okay 1967

123
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
Utop High versus Continental baking

124
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
Can big

125
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,791
National frozen pie companies sell really cheap pies in Utah

126
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,839
I need business top 40 local Pike

127
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,495
No way okay but what is the local Pie Company controls most of the local market and keeps making a profit through

128
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Most of the price for

129
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,079
Still no show in case after case

130
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
The court kept

131
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,431
Ruling for the little guy kept ruling for team David

132
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,039
And expanding the definition of what was it legal what was bad for comfort

133
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
So there was

134
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
A kind of joke

135
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
At the time

136
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
That the Supreme Court was like the little boy who

137
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
13 News

138
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,071
How to spell banana but didn't know when to stop

139
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,983
But what I want to sleep

140
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,079
I'm trying to spell banana but didn't know where to stop so we kept going

141
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,431
Banana nano3

142
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
But finally I got

143
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,599
Right she was saying that it was appropriate for the Supreme Court to find for David to find for small businesses

144
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
In some cases

145
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
That's the banana

146
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
Banana

147
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
But the court didn't stop there

148
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
It kept intervening into

149
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,095
We probably should have just left the market alone

150
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,143
That's beat naanaanaa

151
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
And to be clear for Eleanor Fox

152
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,263
The basic antitrust worldview at the time

153
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
What's correct

154
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
It was just

155
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,103
Did the court went too far in a

156
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,687
But Robert Bork did not see it that way

157
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
At all

158
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,271
He's going to law school at the University of Chicago where he was

159
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,111
Profoundly influenced by this group of economist

160
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
And lawyers

161
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:56,511
Who are arguing in a very Broadway that in general the government was way too involved

162
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
When brake applied this

163
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
Chicago School logic 2

164
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
Antitrust

165
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,399
He didn't see just a

166
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
Few weird Supreme Court decision

167
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Instead

168
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,079
She saw an entire worldview built on a fundamental misunderstanding of what

169
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
Competition bench

170
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,431
And what the point of antitrust was supposed to be

171
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
We set out to destroy that

172
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,087
Just reduce it to rubble and build a whole new world you in its place

173
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
He started writing and arguing

174
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
And in 1978

175
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,791
He published what was arguably the most important work on antitrust

176
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
Ida Tarbell took on John Deere a

177
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Propeller and stand

178
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
It was a book

179
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
Call the antitrust

180
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Paradox

181
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
Do you remember when that book came out

182
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
Was it a big deal

183
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Yes

184
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,871
Did you see people reading it like was it did it have a moment

185
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:50,271
Would you be on the subway in Pokemon go

186
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
People I hate

187
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
You read

188
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,927
I don't know you were assumed to have

189
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
Jake and I both have copies of the

190
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
We both read it

191
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,095
And it's an important book that we're going to talk about for a little bit

192
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
Because in this book

193
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,191
Work goes through those cases from the 1960s

194
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,471
And many many more

195
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
It essentially says

196
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:15,359
If you look at these you can see clearly antitrust policy has gone

197
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Way too far

198
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
For example the brown shoe

199
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,783
If a shoe company wants to buy a shoe store

200
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Fine

201
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,159
If the shoe company forces out other brands and then consumers want those other brands

202
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,303
They will go to another store the shoe company will either start selling those other brands again or go out of business

203
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
Either way

204
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
The free market will sort it out the government

205
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
Did not need to intervene

206
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,727
Vons grocery store case that case work

207
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
Two stores wanted to merge into one

208
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
You know he looks at that University says yes

209
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
Sometimes mergers are bad

210
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
You know I say

211
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,247
Two firms merge and get 100% of the market

212
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
That's clearly definitely bad

213
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,903
And in fact you know he steps back any looks and he finds this threshold that's way below that

214
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,511
He says it may be reasonable to block murders where the new firm would have more than 40 per

215
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Percent of the

216
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,095
Vons grocery store case in LA

217
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,703
Pause would have had seven and a half percent of the Los Angeles grocery store

218
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
You want to bet he says

219
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
That's not bad

220
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
Clearly we can let that

221
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
Also that you taught Pi case

222
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,991
Where the company said it was the victim of a price War but kept selling pies at a profit

223
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Work looks back at that

224
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
And wrote

225
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
There is no economic theory

226
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,207
Worthy of the name they could find an injury to competition on the facts

227
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
Defendants were convicted

228
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
Not of injuring competition

229
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
But quite simply

230
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
Worx big argument in the book

231
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,959
The point of antitrust is

232
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Just encourage

233
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Everybody

234
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
But

235
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
Encouraging competition

236
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Doesn't

237
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,919
Mean protecting David against Goliath

238
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,247
You know if Goliath comes along and make some more pleasant groceries

239
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
Restore ourselves a cheaper frozen pie

240
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,159
Then go I should win and David should lose that is what competition mean

241
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
The Supreme Court in bork's

242
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,767
The View was not encouraging competition it was

243
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
Protecting companies like

244
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
The Utah Pie Company

245
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
But didn't want to compete

246
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,679
The court was using antitrust law

247
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,983
To make competition itself

248
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
That is a pear

249
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Antitrust

250
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,871
The law that is supposed to help competition

251
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
Was actually harming

252
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,479
Import in this book not only pointed out these problems

253
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
He also

254
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
Argued first

255
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,367
The chi said was to stop focusing on comp

256
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
Predators Andino David

257
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
The other David and Goliath

258
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
Instead work said

259
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,047
We should focus on protecting consumer

260
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:47,423
So you don't straight-up price-fixing what a bunch of companies get together and decide not to compete on price

261
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,239
That is definitely bad for consumers we should go after that

262
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,799
Also you know like those murders if a company

263
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,639
Buys up all the other companies in its business like Standard Oil did

264
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
Pretty clearly bad for consumers

265
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
Butt pork look back at lots of other things

266
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
The court found illegal

267
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,087
Price Wars manufacturers buying retailer

268
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
Small merge

269
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,415
And he says those are usually fine

270
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
If they lead to lower prices or better stuff

271
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
That's good for consumers

272
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
And if they don't

273
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,351
Consumers will shop somewhere else

274
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
We can leave this to the free market

275
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,935
You can almost boil the book down in

276
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
$0.01

277
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
That's in the final

278
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Says

279
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,127
The only goal that should guide the interpretation of the antitrust laws

280
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
Is the welfare of consumer

281
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,271
Consumer welfare with is really pretty different goal for anti

282
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
Work was saying

283
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,135
When a business wants to do something we're not so sure about

284
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
We've been focusing on how this will affect

285
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
The other business

286
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,303
We should be focusing on how this will affect

287
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
The consumer

288
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:53,215
After the book came out consumer welfare became this viral phrase among conservative antitrust

289
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,799
Did you have a sense that it would be impactful when you read it

290
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
I think

291
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Yes

292
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
But

293
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,015
I probably could not have imagined how impactful it would be

294
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Say more about that

295
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
Oh cuz it became the Bible

296
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
In 1980

297
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
Ronald Reagan was elected

298
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,767
He was very much on board with this free market cost

299
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,863
His administration adopted new much more permissive

300
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,167
Very bourke's merger guidelines

301
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
Built around this idea of

302
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Consumer welfare

303
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,591
And that idea also transform the way the Supreme Court itself thought about anti

304
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,687
The court cited the antitrust Paradox the year after it came out

305
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,527
And then for decades in one ruling after another after another

306
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,599
The court started reversing its earlier antitrust decision

307
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,903
And using the consumer welfare standard

308
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,975
To legalize more and more kinds of business

309
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,303
There was an argument going on in the seventies

310
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
And and

311
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
WorkOne

312
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
K1

313
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
Are we still living in in

314
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
Bourque's world

315
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Yes

316
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
This consumer welfare stand

317
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Now

318
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Define

319
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
Antitrust law

320
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895
You heard it just last year when

321
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,967
Another antitrust case came before The Supreme

322
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:14,367
Luke 16:14 54 Ohio at all versus American

323
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,719
American Express in this case was definitely the Goliath and

324
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,791
1 minute and 15 seconds into the oral arguments

325
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
Justice Neil Gorsuch

326
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Broken with a

327
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
We're not here to protect

328
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,191
Competitors ripeness Murphy

329
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:33,823
Protecting consumers

330
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:39,711
Correct just like the ghost of Robert Bork was sitting there whispering and Justice Gorsuch

331
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:45,855
My question is do you have any evidence fit on a net basis consumers pay more and I don't believe you have

332
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
The court found in favor of American

333
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Express

334
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Some antitrust

335
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Cases are

336
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
You know a bunch of

337
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Companies collude to fix prices

338
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,887
That is obviously bad for competition obviously bad for consumers

339
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
The government should

340
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
Definitely stop it

341
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
Under the companies prevented from happening

342
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
But there are lots

343
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,103
And lots and lots of anti-drug

344
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Face

345
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,687
When a manufacturer wants to buy a retailer

346
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,503
Or when a bunch of companies start engaging in a price War

347
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,807
When it is much harder to

348
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,111
Figure out whether the government should intervene

349
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,183
And what are the really striking things is

350
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
A lot of the time

351
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
The answer you get to

352
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,327
Is basically the result of where you start

353
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
If you start out thinking

354
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,679
You know the free market muesli work

355
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,031
New competitors can come in and take business away from the big established player

356
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,615
Then you will usually want to let the free market sorted

357
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
But if you think the free market just

358
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
Doesn't work that well if you think it's

359
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,087
Pretty easy for big companies to use their power to suppress competition

360
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,415
Then you will think yeah it a lot of those sort of hard call cases

361
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,535
The government should intervene in the free market in order to make free market competition

362
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
Eleanor Fox

363
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,375
Says she thinks of the bork Revolution

364
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
The Chicago School Revel

365
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Into

366
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
The first part

367
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
What's a useful corrective

368
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,591
Some of the accessories of the 60

369
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,919
It really did sharpen thinking about the economics of

370
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
And what competition really me

371
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
But there was also this second

372
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
There was never explicit

373
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
But that second part she says

374
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,439
Was implicit in everything Robert Bork

375
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
The second part is about the

376
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Presumption

377
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,095
That the market works really well that government intervention is

378
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,167
Really bad that government messes up when it comes in

379
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,287
That friends can take care of themselves and if they don't do right the market will catch them

380
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:45,407
So that second part is the ideological part the first part

381
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,271
We needed badly and we got and we adjusted to it

382
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
The second part we didn't need

383
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
Foxes that second part

384
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,439
The assumption that the free market is good government intervention is

385
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Is bad

386
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,047
Has pushed the government and the court too far in the other direction

387
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,143
The government just doesn't bring antitrust cases as often as it used to

388
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,703
And when it does it's like the banana joke

389
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
He's back but

390
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,519
Instead of fighting for David ever

391
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
Now the court almost always rules in favor

392
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,895
As a result

393
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
In lots of Indus

394
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
Food production in

395
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Banking

396
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
And Airlines and on and on and on

397
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
A smaller number of firm

398
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Is controlling a

399
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
A bigger and bigger share of

400
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,231
This tends to feel beautiful pretty abstract to us

401
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
SF consumer

402
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,791
Just in the past few years

403
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
And even really just in the past

404
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
Year

405
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
This issue has suddenly come to feel much more

406
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,727
Much more real much more sort of visceral much more

407
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
And this is largely

408
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
Because of the

409
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,127
Incredibly fast rise of a few gargantuan

410
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Basically Google Facebook

411
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
And Amazon

412
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:56,575
The world Robert were created was the world that made it possible for those companies to get so big

413
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
And so powerful

414
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:06,559
Next time on planet money has the board Revolution gone too far

415
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
Amore the point

416
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,399
What should we do about these giant death
