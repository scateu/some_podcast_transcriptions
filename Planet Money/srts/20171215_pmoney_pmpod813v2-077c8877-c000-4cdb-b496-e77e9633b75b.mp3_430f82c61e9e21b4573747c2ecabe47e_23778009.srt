Bobby's buyer's right away because they're wearing shiny red ribbons on their name tags

Entourage

89
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,120
You're surrounded by people

90
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
Hi my name is Tony Stallone

91
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,568

He keeps claiming there is so I don't know I haven't had a check that out yet

93
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
Truthfully it is a second cousin twice

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
Oh my God you really

95
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,648
Tony Salone is the produce buyer for

96
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,952
They do a lot of grocery delivery

97
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,815
Has been in the produce business for more than a hundred years

98
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
It's in my DNA

99
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,447
You standing next to this food displaying is gorgeous tomatoes and he's like

100
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,287
He's Brooklyn he tell me exactly how you have to store tomatoes

101
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
To keep them the freshest

102
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,199
Image of the guy who have been examining Tomatoes since he was 5 years old so when I walk down

103
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
I'll take I just get overwhelmed

104
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
What is

105
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Tony's

106
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,855
Strategy what is he looking for exactly

107
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,415
Well Tony has a line his strategy is

108
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,279
What the show come to me what do you mean by that is he's letting the show show him

109
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
The hottest ladies

110
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
He has another line

111
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,143
People don't buy products now

112
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,471
I'll pay by solution Tony Stallone has a lot of life

113
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
We have a lot of

114
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,079
Add another line he had is millennial

115
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
That is a problem

116
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
That he needs to find a solution for

117
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
So what tone is

118
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
Looking for a fish

119
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
How to deliver

120
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Precious

121
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
Most ready to eat

122
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Eat produce

123
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575

Also they can eat

125
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
It right away

126
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,159
And the two items he's focused on right now

127
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
Are berries

128
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
An avocado

129
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
Because Tony is convinced

130
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,607
State of a grocer can keep their berries and avocados beautiful and ripe

131
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,167
The customer is going to buy the rest of their produce

132
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
At that store

133
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:34,591
That is 100% true that is how I live my life like little guy walk into a store because I see raspberries and avocados

Fun watching the show and it said enjoyed watching because everybody knows him and he knows everybody

137
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,111
Any glass into this booth with you

Avocado guys

139
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Westpac

140
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
They are like the Ava

141
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Avocado

142
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
They have mastered the complicated

143
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
It's science

144
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,607
Getting every avocado tree

145
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399

Are they having like this complicated science

148
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,847
Discussion

149
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Annie's thinking

150
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
He wants to do a deal with

151
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
And that moment

152
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
Robert

153
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
I noticed something

154
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
Because Tony Stallone is in that booth

155
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
Other people start

156
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Looking at this

157
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
They start checking out

158
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Avocado

159
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,023
Because Tony Stallone is just standing there it's like he's annointed this booth

160
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
Which is Magic

161
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
Eventually says

162
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679

00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
Complex about to get the magic

165
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359

169
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,047
Is natural because your assignment was to find

170
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
The new

171
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
SuperFood

172
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
Every year there's some sort of super food

173
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,959
Pomegranate kale the goji berry

174
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
Something that will

175
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
Reverse the ravages of

176
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Time and

177
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
Allow you to live forever

178
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,871
And Ice I have found it

179
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Headed over

180
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
No

181
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
The journey

182
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
Okay go ahead

183
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,599
I'll be back I got the assignment

184
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,647
Walk away and it Dawns on me

185
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
I don't know what a superfood is

186
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
Superfood corn is good brussel sprouts cherries I have no idea

187
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,703
It's not a scientific category

188
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
It is a marketing tool

189
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
How's it going

190
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
One of my first stops

191
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,335
Was the place that claims to have

192
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
The original

193
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,175
Superfruit a pom wonderful

194
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,479
This is a pomegranate juice that was super popular

195
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
510 years ago

196
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
So what's up to this booth

197
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Nice a well

198
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
Why don't you interview the Press

199
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
She happens to be right here are either present if I'm wonderful everybody who's anybody

200
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:06,143
New York produce show you can just talk to them

201
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Elizabeth Stevenson

202
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Explains that

203
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
About 15 years ago

204
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,335
Pom wonderful with having trouble getting America to fall in love with a pomegranate

205
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:19,455
Community tap

206
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
Felicidades Giant

207
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
Until they decide

208
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
Let's just make it a juice

209
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,855
And then we can get people to try easy

210
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
But we're not going to put it with the other two

211
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
We're going to put it in the refrigerated section

212
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
With the produce

213
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,863
Super healthy a year-and-a-half later they say pom juice

214
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
Switch everywhere

215
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,727
We still defined that super premium juice category and that you find in the photo

216
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
So

217
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
At the show like who is the next

218
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,431
Public art to this tells me what I should be looking for in the next race super

219
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Number one

220
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,295
It needs to be juicy ball so people can try it for the first time

221
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,391
Okay number to it helps to be kind of an unknown fruit because then it's

222
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
Feels like we're discovering some

223
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Ancient seek

224
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,999
Something in the number 3

225
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
It has to be healthy

226
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
But you shouldn't make

227
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
Too many specific Health claims

228
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,631
Is pom wonderful

229
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:14,239
Trouble for doing that a while ago and so it's best to look for a food that you can just say

230
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
Has the antibiotics

231
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
We've got the antitoxin

232
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,103
Superfood super

233
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Announcer

234
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
With a purpose

235
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
Dragon fruit that's not quite right at sea

236
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,783
Star fruit and starfruit

237
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:33,183
The weirdest interesting little things called the gooseberries Regional Park

238
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
And I guess it doesn't really taste like a tomato it feels like it's me and Robert I don't know if you remember this but you totally

239
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,399
Interrupted my Gooseberry experience

240
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:48,543
What's a gooseberry

241
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
Super name meaning of super

242
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Tell me about

243
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
The last stop on the

244
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
I found it and I'll just

245
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Cut the chase

246
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
I'm going to give it to you okay okay

247
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
Dodge

248
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Coffee

249
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Fruit juice

250
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
No

251
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
That's not a thing

252
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
Is coffee fruit

253
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
Wait what is it

254
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
Is it like

255
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
Is it high in antioxidants

256
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
What is this is it usable

257
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
Yes really

258
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
Fairies

259
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Come

260
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
Coffee beans are

261
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
Coffee beans

262
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
Are the pit of Cheerio coffee cherry

263
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
Yes I in the outside the fleshy part people called the

264
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Cascara fruit

265
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
And a lot of companies

266
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
Take the bean and throw away the Shaolin

267
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
The fruit

268
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
What now

269
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
There are companies that are

270
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Keeping that in

271
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
You can try it up you can make it in

272
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
T you could

273
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,815
Make it into a juice will keep me awake is this a coffee substitute yeah we thought we knew what a soup

274
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
But this one has caffeine

275
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,727
It is a super super fruit is so awesome have you tasted it how does it taste I did taste

276
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,639
I mean kind of sour it's a little bit like cranberry juice a little bit like

277
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,455
Pom wonderful actually it's a portion of that juices coffee

278
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,759
Cockatrice apparently actually very bitter

279
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,319
So they cut it with some pineapple juice or some other juice

280
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,391
And that's how they make it drinkable

281
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Pineapple juice is basic

282
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,767
Listen to the task was not to find a sugar-free drink

283
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
But you asked me for super

284
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,863
And you got it you got juice you got antioxidants

285
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
You can stay young forever

286
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,959
We came back to claim with the science but

287
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
There you go

288
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,855
Article Mark remind me of your Simon

289
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Waste

290
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
I got super into it right away

291
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,487
And when you walk here at a show that's all about freshness

292
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
And ripeness and bounty

293
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,815
And you start asking about

294
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Rotting

295
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
Garbage like people do not like to talk about ways

296
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
The Banana Man

297
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
He just said

298
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
First we take what I learned that like big picture

299
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,687
30 to 40% of the American food supply is wasted

300
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Every year

301
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Throw it up

302
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
Maybe that the cow's butt

303
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
Basically

304
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
Left in the ground for ghost

305
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,903
And the big reason that I heard for this was

306
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
Looks

307
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
People just don't like

308
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,767
In America to eat ugly food

309
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
I will go through a hundred bananas

310
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
To find the right one

311
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,143
And so we're fuzzy were superficial

312
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
And there was this

313
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
Thing that I started to hear

314
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,031
Yeah we say I II appeals by a peel

315
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
No in our industry

316
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,943
You know if you look at what's on the Shelf if it looks pretty

317
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
And it's got great color

318
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
Well it must be good

319
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,575
That Peak Krieger from boo 338

320
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,135
Robinson fresh a giant company like one of the

321
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
The top 5 produce producers in a

322
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,255
So wasted because people don't like ugly

323
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,071
Products then the answer would be

324
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
To somehow

325
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
Make things look

326
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Prettier

327
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
On the Shelf

328
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
No it's actually the Opera

329
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
It's to make American consumers

330
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,591
Look into their soul and treat fruits like they would like to treat people

331
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
And value them for what's on the inside not on the outs

332
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,271
It didn't work so well with people how's that going to work with fruit

333
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,855
They're leading in heart they have made an entire line of products called

334
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,647
Misfits of just owning it

335
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,999
So like the Cucumber that has a yellow stripe on it or the grapes that are too small

336
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,303
They take them out and put them in a bag they put the word

337
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,863
Misfits on it and then they sell it at a discount

338
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,263
And other companies are doing something pretty similar like pairs that were too small before now they just called them kids size and

339
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
Put it in an adorable bag watch for free

340
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Kansai pass

341
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
So I thought

342
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Okay

343
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
The produce industry has figured out the waste problem

344
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
And then I had to

345
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Totally

346
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
We White

347
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
Cuz I met someone from our tribe

348
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:49,695
Turn on Brad record an associate professor and the applied economics and management school at Cornell University

349
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
I love their hiding everywhere

350
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:57,375
What is an economist a food waste Atkins he's like the perfect man just walking around the produce show

351
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,471
It's so Brad says yeah ugly food that is a problem

352
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
But he says there's a way bigger prop

353
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,847
The biggest place where food is wasted is in our kitchen

354
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
And he says that's because

355
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
Who has gotten so cheap relative to everything else

356
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
That people will buy food

357
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,551
Just to make sure it doesn't run out without even planning to eat

358
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
We buy too much

359
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
He does he surveys

360
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:24,767
In the store where people are making the decisions to buy food and what he's found is that we approach buying food with a different logic

361
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
Define others

362
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
Unlike many other things we buy

363
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
People

364
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
In the back of their mind

365
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
Already know that they're going to waste

366
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:38,847
A lot of food they just know that some percentage of the food that they buy or some percentage of

367
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
This food that they have in their household

368
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:45,247
Will be wasted a bunch of stuff think I'm going to cook all weekend

369
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
And then we'll go out to rest

370
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,855
And then Your Spinach Withers up and get small and will

371
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
It's liquid

372
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,439
So the way he sees it is it just

373
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719

Your task

388

389
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:39,519
To go get free samples it so I imagine you eating like a a few chips and a few slices of Apple

390
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:45,919
You've you've taken everything from the show I'm misunderstood my assignment

391
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
I thought it was good as many free items

392
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
They really embrace.

393
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551

Jennifer Washington and Oregon State

431
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
Which is where most of our pairs

432
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,439
So the other Bob's

433
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
Are telling you

434
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
That pairs are having

435
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
A sad sad time

436
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
Absolutely

437
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,679
I've worked in the produce industry for more years than I care to say

438
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
And

439
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,495
It's a misunderstood crew

440
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
Misunderstood

441
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
Okay

442
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
Let's put Paris on

443
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
Therapy couch

444
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
What

445
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,919
What is the trouble

446
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,711
People think of

447
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Pears as just

448
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
Misshapen

449
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
So they go to the store

450
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
And they

451
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,135
Grab a fresh pair and they take a bite out of it

452
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,695
And it's just sort of hard and

453
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Gracci

454
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
And then they think

455
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Did they hate

456
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,863
Paris forever and the next time you go to the store they just buy it out right

457
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
I think apples have it easy

458
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Hey Joe

459
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
Apple's Dudley Avenue Z

460
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
Apples don't need an instruction

461
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
What pairs

462
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,359
Paris you got to wait you got to wait 7

463
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,151
10 days for them to be at Peak

464
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
Ripeness you need a cat

465
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
Sure

466
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
Or you have to know when

467
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,855
It's ready so they invented This brilliant slogan

468
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
Same check

469
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,183
The net meaning like what like

470
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
Picture of your thumb into that

471
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,743
The neck Park

472
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,071
Yeah press right near the stem and if it gives a little bit

473
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
It's right

474
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,983
They've given up on your generation is Going On to the Next Generation

475
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,799
Because it's so easy I mean even you go to school

476
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
And you talked a little kids

477
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Will you tell him

478
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
When you go home tonight

479
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,223
You tell your parents that you know how to tell when a pear is ripe

480
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
It Is by checking the neck

481
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
So easy check the neck

482
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,575
I love that

483
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
When it comes

484
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
What's 2

485
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
2 fruit and vegetables

486
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
We're letting children Loop

487
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
There's a bigger lats

488
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Robert

489
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Did the boxers try

490
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Teach us all

491
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,327
Patience is a virtue

492
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,935
Okay alright thank you Nick Felton

493
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,439
So while the rest of us were wandering around

494
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,231
Hasting Delicious Fruit

495
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
And vegetables

496
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,607
Sally Helm had a very different assignment Sally your assignment was to

497
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
To find

498
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
Gadget something

499
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,751
Non-edible non-food products

500
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
Hamster the food processor

501
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:02,175
So I was walking around the aisles and I got a text from my fellow producers McFadden

502
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
And he was like

503
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,039
Okay Sally 6:15 Booth 6:15 is your birthday

504
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:13,695
18615 hello

505
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:18,815
What wouldn't what is this so we make a 6-inch by 6-inch limited hologram

506
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,679
Program with specific sets of frequencies to inhibit mold and bacteria growth Plus

507
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:28,543
We can also replicate the frequency that the Earth make a food want to stay alive

508
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
I

509
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:36,223
Saw V

510
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,807
15 minutes

511
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:46,207
They told me all about this card and I brought it I want it so it says food freshness car in the front

512
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
It's like a little

513
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,279
Square gold laminated

514
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,375
Card looks like one of those holographic stickers you would get from a gum machine

515
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,423
And at least according to Reagan RJ

516
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
What it does is

517
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,543
You know how strawberries like go moldy really quickly. Ideas whatever

518
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
So you put

519
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,127
The food freshness card in your fridge

520
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,663
Wither strawberries or whatever

521
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,711
And if it's within 5 cubic

522
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,807
Beat that means frequencies that are coming off the card

523
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,367
Will inhibit the mold

524
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
Growing

525
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
Process

526
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,792
And I will say I have not had time to

527
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
Talk to the proper food

528
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
Scientist

529
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:30,240
Safety expert I don't know any one who knows how science works

530
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,288
I'm just going I'm just going with Rick and RJ here

531
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,080
They took me to the card

532
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,640
And they point out in Dulce in the corner

533
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,920
They're like these shapes

534
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:42,272
So it's like circles and triangles and

535
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,344
Q This is a crucial part of

536
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:52,256
Why did the sacred geometry go to the science behind it like metatron's cube is 1 a sacred geometry

537
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,328
Is in there. You know the Flower of Life

538
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,376
The different layers in the hologram

539
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,472
When you say the frequencies are embedded in the card what do you mean

540
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,544
Imperative we program the inside nanocrystals

541
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
Inside

542
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:12,992
Okay well again this is welcome to the future we use Tesla technology everyday

543
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,784
We use

544
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,600
We use Tesla technology every single day

545
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
Metatron's

546
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Flower

547
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,464
Nowell metatron's Cube

548
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
The flower of

549
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Life

550
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:29,120
Using Technologies in stolen from Elon Musk in a Tesla

551
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,424
Nanocrystals nanocrystals

552
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
Is this a cult

553
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,568
That's an interesting question is possible I know it's listening

554
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,872
I did ask these guys are you in

555
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,176
I'm sure you were more polite than that number

556
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:47,296
So I'm sure you must got this all the time but this sounds crazy

557
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,624
We get it all the time but we say stick one in your fridge and then call US

558
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
You know

559
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:58,816
I gave you the assignment can you brought me a piece of technology

560
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
Maybe from an alternate universe
