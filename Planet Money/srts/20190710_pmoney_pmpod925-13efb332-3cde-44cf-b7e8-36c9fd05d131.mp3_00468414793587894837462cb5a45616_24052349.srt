1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,072
I started working on the story about recycling

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,400
I did not expect a lost ship

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,680
And the mob

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:14,080
Well I can tell you a story that is actually quite interesting about the origination of recycling

5
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,640
He's a professor of Economics at Bucknell University

6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:22,784
To be able to understand why Americans embraced recycling you have to understand the story of the Garbage barge or the garbage ship

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,064
How the mobro

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,368
The mobro the mobro mo

9
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,440
Dro tell me the story the problem is

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,328

11
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,632

And yeah

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,472
We've kind of recycling

14
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,752
Tell the mafia

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,040

I guess you could call it that that sounds rather sophisticated for somebody like me

114
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,871
You can call me a farmer if you like that's how I grew up

115
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
They were sharecroppers

116

Capital of Alabama

121
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
Lowell grew up in a home

122
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
With no trash

123
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,207
We did not have a trash can

124
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
No ma'am

125
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
Wooden ammo trash

126
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,399
Everything we had to eat we've raised on that farm that we ate

127
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,239
We did get a 5 lb of sugar once in awhile

128
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,847
They'd also get a 50lb bag of flour low remembers the bag came with these

129
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:11,711
Little flower designs on it for my mama made my sister school dresses

130
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
No waste

131
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
No traction

132
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Goodnight something

133
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
We were happy

134
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
All those are the days

135
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,719
Those days where in the 1930s

136
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
And at some point in Los life

137
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
Things changed

138
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
Now we produce

139
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
So much garbage

140
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
My God

141
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
UCI match garbage

142
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
How can we do that

143
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,799
This is where Lowell story with garbage

144
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
Really takes off

145
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
It's the 80

146
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
Lolis in the construction business but

147
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
Like a lot of people at the time he's thinking about

148
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,271
Alternative Energy

149
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
And he hears about a guy in Westchester New York

150
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
Who was turning

151
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
Garbage

152
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
Into energy

153
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
And little things

154
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,535
All that stuff that I hate sitting in landfills

155
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Has this

156
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Hidden

157
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Use

158
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,167
So your motivation was to turn garbage

159
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,191
Into energy

160
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
That's correct

161
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,823
Garbage to energy it look like a very simple deal

162
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
He consults with them engineers and they say

163
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
Yeah this is a thing this works

164
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:19,039
When you pile of trash it decomposes and emits methane gas

165
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,111
And you can use methane to make Power

166
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,719
So if we got enough garbage we could sell the electricity

167
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
To the grade

168
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,303
Everybody agreed this had married

169
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,375
It was a question of putting the pieces together

170
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:40,031
By the way we use this message today to get energy from landfills but back then it was a new idea and

171
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Lowell

172
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,335
Stop business opportunity

173
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,639
He was going to create a huge

174
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Pile of garbage

175
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
And use it for electricity

176
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,039
But he would need a lot of garbage

177
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,367
Your local dump that wasn't enough garbage he needed

178
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,415
Boatloads of garbage

179
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,255
And at the time if you were interested in garbage

180
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
New York

181
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
What's the place

182
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,399
New York City in the 80s had begun running out of landfill space and

183
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,239
How to start paying other states to take their garbage

184
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,079
Salal is like Perfect all use some of that garbage for my

185
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
Big pile of garbage plan

186
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
But in New York

187
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
At the time

188
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
Garbage was controlled

189
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
By the mob

190
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:26,111
Oh yes now that's a story that'll take lot more time than we have today

191
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
Garbage in New York

192
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
That was like a control Subs

193
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,559
That was a cartel that control the flow of garbage

194
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
And that's a good deal.

195
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
But he didn't know any of this at the time

196
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
All he knew was if you wanted to buy garbage in New York

197
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,799
He needed to talk to a guy named cell

198
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
You already know esl

199
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
I really rather not

200
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,783
Spell had guys who collected New York trash

201
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,623
But they still had to pay to dump the trash somewhere to get it landfill

202
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
And Lowell

203
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
Keto Sal

204
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,743
What if I take the garbage off your hands

205
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
For Less

206
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,047
Think about it

207
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,119
And then the FBI shows up at Lowe's store

208
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,191
FBI spoke to me two or three times you know

209
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
Hey what are you up to

210
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
Hauling garbage

211
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
You got any proton

212
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,919
And that's when he said though you know you dealing with the mob that's what it was

213
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
No I didn't know that

214
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
But it doesn't matter

215
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,575
I'm trying to make energy over here

216
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,415
Lowell knowingly gets into business

217
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
With the mafia

218
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,607
Because it didn't really feel like working with the mafia there was a ride in a stretch Cadillac limo that was a

219
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
A little scary for Lowell there was a dinner with Sal

220
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,727
Some guy told Lil where to sit and that's

221
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Swear law LSAT

222
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
And that was it

223
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,079
Laurelwood by Sal's

224
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Garbage

225
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
He's a nice guy

226
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
I like that

227
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,015
He's the guy that had to talk in Jaguar you never heard about that

228
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
The talking

229
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Jaguar

230
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,903
This is a tangent but I mean there's a talking Jaguar we have to

231
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,999
Salvatore avellino had a 1982 black

232
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,559
Jaguar that's what he drove the boss

233
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
Antonio Tony ducks

234
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
Carollo in

235
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
Tony ducks

236
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Because he duck

237
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
Law enforcement

238
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
At least

239
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,359
Until this one thing happened on a rainy night in March of 1980

240
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
83

241
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:28,735
Salvatore's black jaguar is parked outside of a restaurant on Long Island

242
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
An agent

243
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Open the door

244
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Another agent hold

245
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Some kind of

246
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,647
Cover over the Jaguar to make sure that

247
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
No rain drops spot

248
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Deceit

249
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
Do you remove the dashboard

250
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
Lease a bug inside

251
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
Put the dashboard back

252
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
They tapped

253
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
Sal's Jaguar

254
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:54,335
And this bug recorded mob conversations that eventually took down all 5 bosses of the mafia

255
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
The car

256
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Talked

257
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
The talking Jaguar

258
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
Okay back to Lowell

259
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,783
Lowe's not doing anything illegal

260
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575
He's just buying garbage

261
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,391
He arranges with the landfill in North Carolina

262
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
That he's going to dump

263
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
Tons of New York garbage there

264
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
Create a methane

265
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Paradise

266
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:19,679
So at okay so you had the source you have the seller you had landfills agreeing to take the garbage

267
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Next

268
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
He has to move the garbage down

269
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,055
And the cheapest way to do that is by boat

270
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,455
Barge actually he gets one from Jacksonville Florida called the mobro 4000 a big

271
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,271
Flat iron deck to load the garbage onto

272
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,623
And he gets a tugboat from New Orleans called the break of dawn

273
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,647
To tow the barge

274
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
A tugboat little tiny little cute little tugboat

275
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,143
Pound for pound nothing more powerful

276
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
The notable

277
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
The barge gets loaded up in New York

278
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
20 feet high hell down with

279
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Cables

280
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,615
And on March 22nd 1987

281
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
3186

282
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
Tons of garbage

283
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
Set sail

284
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
Steered by

285
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
Captain Duffy St

286
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,391
Pierre St-Pierre one of the best in the business

287
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
Were You There When it got loaded up

288
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Are you aware

289
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,583
I know I was watching that like a mama watch over her new baby

290
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
What you talking about

291
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,959
At that time of my life my whole life was tied to that thing

292
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,007
At that time Lowell is

293
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Full of Hope

294
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:34,431
I told Debbie the captain now hurry up and get back here fast as you can so we can get another load down there for the weekend you know

295
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
Are you ready you're ready to

296
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Oh yeah

297
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
Yeah we ready to load up

298
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
The barge is moving

299
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
Very slowly

300
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
And people start noticing

301
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Like

302
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
What is that thing

303
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,047
And somewhere else in there

304
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Crowd started showing up

305
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,447
I know the news newspaper people

306
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
TV people

307
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
All the popes

308
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
I want to know who this idiot is

309
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,151
All in all this garbage around I said here I am

310
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
What else can I say

311
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,319
Remember New York was already Trucking garbage to other states so

312
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,135
Lowell didn't think a ship would be any different

313
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
But somehow

314
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
The site of this barge

315
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
Full of trash coming down the coast

316
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
Did not sit well with

317
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
People all these people

318
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,399
We don't want that garbage in our

319
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Wonderful state

320
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:33,055
Immediately it was pretty obvious this is going to be a whole different problem than what I had

321
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
I have not anticipated

322
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
Now this is just

323
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:42,015
Normal garbage from people's homes nothing especially toxic or dangerous about it

324
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
But

325
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:48,927
The EPA had just released new rules that said you couldn't dump toxic waste in landfills anymore

326
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:54,047
Someone said they saw bedpan on the barge like from a hospital or something

327
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
So everyone got it into their heads that

328
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,959
There must be some Yankee mobster toxic waste hidden on the barge

329
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
And they're trying to unload it on us

330
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
A court order

331
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
Lock the barge

332
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
From unloading in North Carolina

333
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
I couldn't

334
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,319
Do anything more to try to force their hand which was discussed you know we had a valid country

335
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,183
But to try to force their hand would not have helped anybody

336
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
So what do you do now

337
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
I told him

338
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,839
Don't Debbie get out in the ocean get away from this crowd

339
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
Get Alma Over the Horizon

340
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,983
Drop anchor and let's give us some time to think

341
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
You know

342
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,103
Are you drop the anchor so it's just hanging out in the ocean

343
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Until we could

344
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
Meet see what we going to do that

345
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
At some point Florida goes

346
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:50,111
Well we'll take it will charge you this much to unloaded here come on over

347
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
So there goes Duffy

348
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,463
We get there in the coast of Florida somewhere

349
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,535
Outcomes crowd of 10000

350
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
Dead again

351
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,143
Where we went it drew big crowds

352
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,727
Alabama is a don't even think about bringing it here

353
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:11,103
Lowell has the barge tied to a cypress tree on the Mississippi River waiting

354
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
Mississippi

355
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
Didn't want it

356
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
Louisiana

357
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Don't bring it here either

358
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:22,111
It was like a soap opera a helicopter is following the barge around its on the Nightly News like

359
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:26,207
Who will say no tomorrow

360
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,047
That garbage has been unsuccessfully seeking a home

361
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,887
For almost a month-and-a-half now still loaded with tons of garbage

362
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
Still on water

363
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,519
So this little Tugboat is tugging the barge around looking for a home

364
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,871
Poor Captain Duffy St-Pierre campdoc anywhere to take a shower

365
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Aventon

366
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,455
And it seems like everyone is following

367
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
The Garbage barge

368
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,879
The most watched load of garbage in the memory of man dripping Brown ooze of possibly infectious mean

369
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,487
Material people everywhere talking about how they found syringes and

370
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
What not

371
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
Nothing

372
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,375
The EPA comes out in white suits and breathing mask

373
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
To inspect the garbage

374
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
They determine it's fine

375
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
It's just garbage

376
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
Does it matter

377
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,359
The Mexican Navy went to the barge to deliver a message

378
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
Stacked the barge

379
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
Was not wanted in my

380
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
Belize

381
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
The Bahamas

382
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
They sent out their Defense Forces

383
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Do not

384
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Bring it here

385
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,111
And the Lord says

386
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,951
He wasn't actually trying to send the garbage to other countries

387
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
They just thought he was

388
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
Too close to them I guess

389
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:38,143
They were just so surprising something of that magnitude did like it did it

390
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
So surprising it was

391
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
Nothing really

392
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
So the barges

393
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,103
Bobbing in the water in the Gulf of Mexico

394
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
2 months

395
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,663
Three months four months

396
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
Waves of saltwater

397
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,807
Crashing over the garbage baking in the sun covered in flies

398
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Probably seagulls

399
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,439
Play that you started

400
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
Emotions of mine

401
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,863
What people took from the image of this Garbage barge

402
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
Sailing around from us

403
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,727
Was that there was no place for the garbage to go

404
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,823
It became a symbol for America's problem with trash

405
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,223
We've run out of places to throw away our throw away my 1990 Accord

406
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:29,855
According to One Federal survey at least 27 States will be critically short of space to dump garbage

407
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
Everyone is like

408
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
What have we done

409
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,999
What have we done to this country we filled it

410
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
With trash

411
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,839
Movies are made about the barge

412
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:44,447
It was a film called Sex Lies and videotape them in again

413
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,007
In the movie he says the main character starts out

414
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
Sitting on a therapist couch

415
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
The very first scene of the movie and she's like

416
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,663
I just can't sleep at night

417
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,991
Where is all the garbage going

418
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Garbage

419
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,927
All I've been thinking about all week is garbage I mean I just can't stop thinking about it

420
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
NFL

421
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,863
We have to ride a place to put this stuff eventually

422
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
Last time I

423
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,495
I started feeling this way as when

424
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:23,871
That barge stranded in you know what's going around the island and nobody would claim it

425
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Remember that

426
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
Yes

427
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
There were all these

428
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
That's coming out at the time

429
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,135
That showed that the number of landfills in America

430
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Was

431
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Plummeting

432
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
Landfills were closing

433
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,535
And people kept signing me stats in stories

434
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
About the Garbage barge

435
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,375
Info people put it all together and their minds

436
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,727
They conclusion west of the United States is running out of landfill space

437
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
United States

438
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Wistful

439
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,823
That we couldn't store anymore

440
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
And where we fool

441
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:02,527
We weren't full the reason why the

442
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
Happening at the time

443
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Yes

444
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
Landfills

445
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
We're closing

446
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,951
But that was because there were new rules for landfills

447
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,767
Stricter rules to protect the environment

448
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,423
BPA said you know have to do things like line the bottom of landfills with plastic so they don't contaminate the ground

449
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,007
And so the old town dump every little town had one

450
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
Without of compliance

451
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,103
You can't accept garbage in here anymore if you legal

452
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,455
And so these Town dumps for closing by the dozens

453
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
In their place

454
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:38,111
Regional landfills we're becoming a thing bigger landfills that could accept trash

455
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,671
While still following all these new rules

456
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,487
The natural resources defense Council says

457
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:48,095
They used to be about 10,000 dumps in the mid-80s and that now we have

458
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
Less than 3000

459
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,959
But we were not running out of space then

460
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
And

461
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,775
We still aren't running out of space

462
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,591
Thomas says we probably have

463
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,175
Thousands of years of landfill space left in the US

464
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
And even

465
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,295
Hardcore environmentalists reluctantly agree that

466
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,855
Yeah we have a lot of space left

467
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
But people

468
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
Thought we were running out of space

469
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
And

470
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
That was What mattered

471
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,351
And so the recycling era was born

472
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,679
This is when state government said we're going to require cycling

473
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,215
2 up cycling to occur

474
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,495
This is when people started

475
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:31,103
Separating their paper and plastic into little bins in their homes and offices

476
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,175
Because of lowland the mafia is garbage

477
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,991
That have more of an impact on society then

478
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,783
Anything else you talked about I was

479
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,087
That's where that's why we recycle Tuesday

480
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,879
Who knows we be without that barge

481
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,207
Recycling became the answer to a problem that

482
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
Didn't exist

483
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:54,143
They were good environmental reasons for it of course less weighs less pollution but that's not what convinced cities

484
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,703
Used to start sending trucks to everyone's homes

485
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,263
To pick up their glass bottles and cardboard box

486
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Fear

487
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
Convince us to do that

488
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:08,223
With lies that cost more in his abilities had to figure out ways to make it work

489
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
Financially in

490
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
Any kind of

491
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
Been moving along since then

492
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,903
Lowe's Garbage barge made of 5 months

493
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,208
Thousand Mile Journey before it found a home

494
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,536
A judge order the trash took go back to where it came from

495
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
New York

496
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
To be burned

497
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,912
Greenpeace hung up a sign that said

498
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
Next time

499
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Driver side

500
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,032
The ashes were buried in the landfill

501
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Lowell

502
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
Paid

503
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,384
How much money did you lose

504
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,712
That's the most embarrassing Secret of My Life

505
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,784
More than I would ever want to dream of

506
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
It was a worse

507
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,672
Proposition I ever got into okay

508
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:54,304
And forever will be known as that dummy who sell the Garbage barge

509
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
What elixir

510
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
What a legacy

511
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,496
How do you feel about I mean

512
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
You are basically

513
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,824
The reason why

514
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
We recycle

515
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,688
I understand all that

516
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,552
But it doesn't reduce my pain of being the world's biggest dummy okay

517
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,880
No you are not the world's biggest gummy

518
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,696
But it did help me in one respect I guess

519
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,256
Law says the barge taught him an important lesson

520
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,304
That some issues are so

521
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,096
Totally unpredictable

522
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,424
If he could go back to school he says he's want to study anthropology

523
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,752
Understand why people hate the things they hate

524
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
My garbage

525
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:41,408
On my Tombstone I would like them to say this old boy did his damnedest okay

526
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:46,016
Alright with me if they refer to that dummy that that barge in the ocean

527
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
Shoot Me Vine

528
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,856
They put that on my Tombstone is a lie

529
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,696
I don't have any hard feelings toward anybody

530
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,560
I have nothing but love and respect for people wherever they are and whoever they are

531
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,888
And I'm not the least bit worried about leg

532
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
I mean

533
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
So

534
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
We recycle now

535
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,056
But should we

536
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,104
