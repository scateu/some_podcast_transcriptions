Alex blumberg and David kestenbaum reported it back in 2013

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:25,088
And we did the show back when we raised money to make a Planet Money t-shirt

7
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368
We raised

8
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,648
Hundreds of thousands of

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,232
Amazon handled the payment handled the money

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:37,120
And then when we went to move the money from Amazon to our bank account at Chase it took

11
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,400
5 days

12
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,936
It took 5 days

13
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,592
Maybe that's not surprising I mean you see this periodically it'll take 3 to 5 days for the transaction to complete her five to seven business days

14
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,640
But think about that

15
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,736
5 days once Take 5 days what is happening after you click

00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760

17
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,088

Amazon of we can send you anything in a day

25
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568

This question why can take so long to send money from one place to another

49
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
It's a serious question

50
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,808
And in this Lotus I think we'll just a friend it hurts me more than it hurts

51
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,136
It's you and I think part of the reason that I'm excited that I can relate

52
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
That I have been burned by the Sun

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,024
I'm not as good as you

54
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,816
It's a sometimes I'll

55
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,680
Transfer money to my account think it's their pay a bill and then it won't be there and I'll get hit with a late fee

56
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,264
I think that happens a lot and especially if you're paycheck-to-paycheck

57
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,848
You're being penalized by the slowness of the system and nothing else about

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
Our life online is this low

59
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
My first thought you know about why it was so

60
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Like we were transferring a lot of money

61
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Lottabody

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,344
Over $500,000

63
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,928
I was going into this little regular checking account wasn't a

64
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
So I thought

65
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,072
You know maybe sensibly it got a little extra scrutiny and that is why it took so long

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
Set a test that was the case

67
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,472
We tried a second transfer we tried to send just $10 the reversed

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
From Chase to Amazon

69
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
And this transfer

70
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
Took even longer

71
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
8 days

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
So we did the logical thing

73
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
We called up Chase and Amazon

74
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Amazon

75
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,040
What can I do to help you today

76
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
Oh I have a question about my Amazon payments account also I am a reporter for NPR National

77

78
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:50,144
Took my question is I have I have a Amazon payments

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
Account that was

80
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Associate

81
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
Can't answer questions if you

82
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,104
You can't you can't answer questions if it's being recorded

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
Is there any way to

84
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
Get permission to answer questions if they're being recorded

85
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,064
We also tried Chase your call may be monitored or recorded

86
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344

87
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:14,464
Thank you for going to my name is Lolita Baker could I get your first and last name please

88
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,768
Yeah my name is Alex blumberg

89
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,071
I have a question about my Chase account

90
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:23,423
I'm at my so I'm also a reporter for NPR in recording this call for possible broadcast

91
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
K

92
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
Four possible broadcast

93
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,919
Yeah I have a question about my accountant it involves Amazon payments

94
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:42,367
Add involved Enron payment to Amazon amazon.com

95
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,255
We were able to learn that our money got sent through something called the

96
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
ACH system

97
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
Which saint for automated

98
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
Did Clearing House

99
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,399
What exactly that was how it operated

100
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
Why it was so slow

101
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,751
It was surprisingly hard to get people to talk to us on the record about it

102
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,311
Chase and Amazon both the client to make anyone

103
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
Available and would only answer questions

104
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
Dover email

105
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,711
When I did get someone on the phone to ask about the state safe

106
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Why are you doing this story

107
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
I can tell they're hiding something or just

108
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
Embarrassed or just

109
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,623
They were so used to the system it didn't seem weird

110
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
And often the answers only led to more questions for example we found someone who used to work at the Federal Reserve which

111
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
Runs part of the system that handles these electronic pek

112
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
Elizabeth McQueary

113
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,703
And we have what we thought was a simple question

114
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
What does the

115
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
System event look like

116
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
It's a row of machine

117
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,639
Big tall computers with

118
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,711
Information being spit out on monitors where

119
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
Those are classified

120
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
You can't tell me where they are

121
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
No

122
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
Can you can you say witch

123
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
Which state they were in

124
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
You have to realize that

125
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:57,119
That those machines those servers are moving billions of dollars every day so it

126
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
Well protected where those systems are

127
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
Can you tell us what state though

128
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
So I don't think I can

129
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
Another question I thought would be simple but

130
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
What is the deal with

131
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
Weekends

132
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,967
Amazon and Chase both told us that the reason it took so long to transfer money

133
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
Was that there was a weekend

134
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
This is all the time and online banking and bill payment

135
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
It'll take 3 to 5 business days

136
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
5-7 business

137
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
It's always business

138
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,279
If you think that why should that matter

139
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,839
Look at my account online on weekends

140
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,959
I can't even go to the bank on weekends so why does the system these each system closed down a week

141
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,823
It's some point ACH does cut off its operating hours

142
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,687
Moreless has Bankers hours and then let me know cause there is so so this is

143
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,551
It when you talk about the ACH you said the ACH takes banker's hours

144
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,135
Are we taking that people are we talking about machines

145
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,695
We're pretty much talking about machines

146
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
So if we're talking about machines why do they need to take Bankers hours

147
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
That's a good question

148
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
I think you have to really

149
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,495
You have to think of it is a system that was

150
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,823
Conceived and implemented in the 1970s

151
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
The 1970

152
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
40 years ago

153
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
This pizza Financial Plumbing

154
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
It is 40 years old

155
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
That's the reason so slow

156
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Adult

157
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,623
The system was designed long before anything like amazon.com

158
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
How long before the internet

159
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
I was born in the days

160
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
When the way to send money

161
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
Was with a paper check

162
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303
What's imagine the way people made payments

163
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,351
Back before anything was electron

164
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
Before the system.

165
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
Right Stuff example

166
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
An electrician

167
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
Alright say it's 1970

168
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
I want to pay my electricity bill

169
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
I get out my checkbook

170
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
I write out a check

171
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
To the power company for sake

172
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,687
$20.16

173
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,527
Put the check in the mail the post office delivers the check to the power come

174
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
But that's not the end

175
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
The power company Bank

176
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,415
Then makes a note in his ledgers check for 2016 received

177
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
But it still doesn't have the actual money

178
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,791
To get the money it needs to send that same paper check

179
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
Back

180
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
To your bank.

181
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:08,191
So your bank and say yes this is from our customer 1970 Dave kestenbaum

00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
Yes yes $1.16 in his account

183
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,287
And this exchange of paper checks

184
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
Between these two bags

185
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
Had to happen with every check that was written

186
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,919
And it wasn't something that could happen

187
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Through the mail

188
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,015
The exchange of of the paper check had to happen physically

189
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
Between between two financial institutions

190
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:30,207
Bert Harkins is Senior Vice-President with a company called Fiserv which provides technology to financial institutions

191
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
He says sending money back then

192
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
Took a lot of manual labor

193
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,119
The banks would physically exchange bags of checks

194
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,471
If they weren't banks in the same physical location if you had banks in different regions

195
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
The country

196
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:48,639
Then you literally were flying bags of checks from one of the country to the other to do that Exchange

197
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:54,271
In in major metropolitan areas there were set locations which were often just

198
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,391
Sort of parking lots in insecurity areas where literally

199
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,743
Trucks with backup to one another from each individual major financial institution

200
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
And they would pass bags of checks back in

201
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:10,143
And at the very end of this whole process day if your 1970 Bank

202
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
Takes your 1970 check

203
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
Which has gotten back

204
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
From The Electric Company

205
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
Edit mails it back to you

206
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:21,407
All of the story that little check could tell if its Voyage first and Ice Postman took me the electric company

207
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
Then I went to their Bank

208
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,735
And I got put in a bag then I got handed off

209
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
Parking lot to our bank

210
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
Then I got put in the mail again and now I'm home

211
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
And that is the way it works for everyone

212
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
Private individuals like you

213
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Paying my bills

214
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,279
But also enormous institutions huge companies that had to pay their employees

215
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
They did it

216
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
My check

217
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Paycheck

218
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,655
The Social Security Administration millions of checks

219
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Paper checks

220
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
So that was a problem

221
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
The solution to that problem led to the

222
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
And the solution was

223
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,175
We're going to get rid of that really annoying thing where every bank has to find a way to meet up

224
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,967
With other banks in parking lots

225
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
To exchange checks

226
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,295
I think about it if I'm the bank of David

227
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
I have to meet up with the bank of Alex to exchange checks

228
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,183
Maybe I have to go meet up with another bank at another location that the

229
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
In another state

230
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,999
It's a lot of meetings and it just doesn't make it

231
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,095
So they said let's just get rid of all these random meeting

232
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
Between individual banks at different locations

233
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,191
Let's set up a central

234
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
Clearing House

235
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,263
Where all these transactions happen at 1

236
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,079
And help facilitate all these transactions

237
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
We're going to use this magical new technology

238
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Computers

239
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
And banks will not be sending bags of

240
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
Checks to the screen

241
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
Said sticking to be sending

242
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
Magnetic

243
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Computer tapes

244
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
And the tapes each bangle sending it

245
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
And on the table say

246
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,975
Send a hundred bucks to this guy this guy at this Bank

247
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
And the Clearing House you can think of it sort of like

248
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
Enola post office

249
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
It sits sorting all the mail

250
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,911
The gathers up all the transactions destined for particular Bank

251
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
I can put that on it

252
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
Pain in the back pick that up

253
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
Magnetic tapes

254
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,847
Kingship back and forth between banks around the country and the central clearinghouses

255
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
That

256
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
What's the upgrade

257
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
What today looks like

258
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,503
Fairly slow process at when it was when it sort of came online

259
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,807
Was a huge leap forward from what they were doing

260
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
So you can get paid without

261
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
Any paper being involved

262
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
That's crap

263
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,207
Well when you put it that way it seems like an exciting

264
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,583
The Technology's drugs prices in kept getting better over the years computers got faster

265
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Smaller

266
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
Here's a computer ad from 1977

267
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:25,311
You're looking at a small portable computer

268
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,151
The IBM 5150 lb

269
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,223
You can plug it in anywhere

270
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
High definition of portable

271
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
But you can't plug it in

272
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
Eventually we get to the internet

273
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,903
And this system for moving cash

274
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
What happens to it

275
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Nothing

276
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
Basically nothing

277
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,071
It doesn't use magnetic tapes today but it still acts as if it

278
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
All right so as far as we can tell

279
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
Here is what happened

280
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
2R t-shirt money

281
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
What are you trying to transfer

282
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
At 8:03 p.m. on a Thursday I clicked a button on a computer screen

283
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
Sending a request

284
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
Amazon.com

285
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
To transfer the money

286
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
To our bank account

287
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Request

288
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
Go to Amazon

289
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
And it's it's

290
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,855
Because as Amazon wrote To Us in an email it arrives quote

291
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,439
After our last batch for Thursday processing with Transit

292
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:18,047
In the old days I got this the banks had to gather all these requests to send money

293
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,375
And then put them on a magnetic tape and send them out at the end of the day

294
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
So if a request comes in too late

295
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
Keep you have to wait till the next day when the next it goes

296
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
But today there is no tape right at all

297
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
Connected by wires

298
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
And yet

299
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,919
This is still the way it works your request comes in too late

300
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Doesn't happen.

301
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
Next day everything is done

302
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Batches

303
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,063
So I request made it to Amazon's Bank the following day

304
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Which is Friday

305
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,391
From there it got sent to one of the major sorting

306
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,487
You can imagine those big rows of computers and a secret location that Elizabeth

307
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
McCreary describe

308
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,351
They're two of these clearinghouses one is run by the fed the other is run by a collection of

309
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,143
But now

310
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
Wet Saturday

311
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
The Weeknd

312
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
So

313
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Nothing happens

314
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
Find a

315
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
Sunday also a weekend

316
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
Nothing happens

317
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
Monday acronym

318
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
How many arrived at Chase Bank

319
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
At 7:05 in the morning

320
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,759
But it didn't actually appear in our account until Tuesday

321
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
Maybe because Monday was a holiday

322
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
But Tuesday it's finally

323
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,415
Imagine if email work this

324
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Play right you send an email Thursday evening

325
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
It doesn't arrive until Tuesday

326
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,607
Any of these big secret sorting computers that run this ACH system

327
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
It's always stuck in the past

328
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,239
Bert Harkins the payments consultant says that the systems that they use

329
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
Are all based on a nearly extinct programming like

330
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Cutco

331
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
We're in Atlanta and it's hard to find

332
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,199
Graduate from Georgia Tech who know COBOL

333
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Like knowing Latin

334
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
This is the system that carry the T-shirt

335
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,111
Based on a time when we used to exchange checks

336
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
Parking lot

337
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,439
And that was a programming language that no one knows

338
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,535
And this is one of the major ways that money get sent around the United

339
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,375
According to the electronic payments association called nausea

340
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,167
In 2012 there were

341
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
21 billion transactions

342
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,543
Total value 36.9 trillion dollars

343
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
And the more I learn about this

344
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
As you know

345
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
The more crazy it drove me

346
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,223
Because it's not like you can't upgrade the system I mean

347
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
I have proof that you can

348
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
My proof

349
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
Country of England

350
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Kristen live

351
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
People absolutely definitely

352
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:25,535
Was very act by the fattest three dice movement that exactly the same reactions you to say

353
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
I'm sending money

354
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:33,215
Compass Bank here to that bank that they are biggest uses they have lots of water and Technology why is it taking three days

355
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,775
It would be faster for me to take the money out of an ATM

356
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
Wookies Ramsey of the bank

357
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
And give it to them

358
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
And that was definitely

359
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:45,247
A feeling that people who dislike just give me the money out person and blow poke down the road

360
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
It's faster

361
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,831
And so with a push from the British government the banks are agreed

362
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Update

363
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
Vocalink that company that Chris works for

364
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,999
Runs it now it cost pennies per transaction he says

365
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
And it's fast

366
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
It takes literally seconds

367
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
15 seconds

368
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
End-to-end

369
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
So in the USA took 5 days

370
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
Send the teacher money

371
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
In the UK

372
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
You can do it inside

373
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,567
Is it true that there's a limit of about $150,000 per transfer

374
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
In the British system so we have to do it

375
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
As for transfers

376
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
But the

377
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,967
Seconds Chris says business is really like the system

378
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,039
And his daughter really like the system she's in college

379
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
And she sometimes runs out of cash

380
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
I actually regular gas

381
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,231
The central St can you send me some money and I can just hit the button

382
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:33,119
And the money will be with her and intellectually mature second and you're muttering under your breath I should have never put the system in place

383
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:40,287
What Willie it does make it very easy to go about fixing to wifey that I can possibly guess it comes from somebody else know you

384
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,943
Unfortunately you're on the hook 24 by 7 by 365 site

385
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
What about yourself

386
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
IND

387
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,063
For the sake of demonstration can you send her a few pounds now

388
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,391
Interested meaning of Jersey City New York

389
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
If I can get my iPhone I will

390
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:06,143
Try sekai so the moment I'm looking to my online bank account to telephone my balance

391
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
I had

392
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Payments

393
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
Paper synovial

394
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,311
I just bring up a list so I'll go

395
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,127
I think the pantofles of people and that she is

396
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
Write about a time

397
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
Jessica so I will send her

398
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,271
How much does a beer cost in New York

399
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
Better than ten bucks with the Beast

400
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
How come the tip

NASA space Today Show you want to pay 10 lb useful check because if I just made that I accidentally

403
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,447
I didn't want us to get ringing out since it's always important to hear about

404
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,287
Faster payments in that it goes immediately and it's irrevocable

405
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,359
Cuz I usually don't fight 10 lbs is okay

406
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
One moment please

407
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,735
Sami Gayle I have a sickness at 10th and payment center

408
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:59,903
Headbang balance will I be 10 lb sloppy high on should wonder what's an s on doing sending a 10 quid

409
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,559
After we hung up with Kristen we have course call this daughter

410
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
How are you

411
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
I'm good thank you how are you

412
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,471
Did your dad tell you he might be calling

413
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,263
Yeah he filled me in on Africa

414
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
Did you get the money he sent

415
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Very convenient

416
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
Yeah I know

417
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,575
We ask Jessica if she was going to use it to buy a beer she said

418
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,391
No probably something really boring instead

419
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Like a Subway

420
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,743
There are individual banks in United States that have systems like this

421
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
For example in a my bank

422
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
Chase has

423
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,399
Popmoney where you basically can send money instantaneously to other Chase customers

424
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,727
But you can't send instant money to people with account that other bag

425
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,287
Has been thinking about building

426
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
Something more comprehend

427
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
Like what they have in the

428
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,431
Kristen told us that people from the FED of come over to talk to him

429
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,247
And just last year the banks in the United States here

430
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
How the big vote on this

431
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
Should we move to a faster

432
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
With

433
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,159
I know this isn't going to be enough for you Alex

434
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
Same day service

435
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
Meaning send in the morning

436
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,023
It could be there by the end of the day

437
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
Is Elizabeth McQueary

438
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,887
Not necessarily A real-time system

439
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,703
Where are you could have the money instantaneously

440
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
This was sort of a

441
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
A transition to something faster

442
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
Slightly faster

443
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,151
Yes baby bass

444
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,711
But still not really fast exactly

445
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,295
I am the banking Community voted it down

446
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
Voted it down

447
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,647
But was closed but the way the ACH governance sister

448
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
Works need a super majority of Italy

449
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
75%

450
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:45,119
Yes we do not know the exact tally it's not public but we do know that more than half voted yes

451
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,911
But not enough to cross the 75

452
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,751
Elizabeth McCreary says there were concerns about fraud

453
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,799
And also that it would just be this major overhaul

454
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:59,455
Many of these Community Banks they actually close their processing back office at 3 p.m. in the afternoon

455
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
Even before the banks

456
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
Front lobby

457
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Is closed

458
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
So they would have to staff

459
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,135
In order to be able to receive these payments

460
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
Later in the day

461
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,511
Alex you know I'm not as irked by the slowness

462
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,071
Of the system as you are I know that you're not

463
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,887
These reasons they make some sense

464
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,447
Right I mean the US has far more Banks

465
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,055
UK has under 200 mags the USS something like 7000

466
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
And all these different states

467
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,407
Each with their own computer is known people who know the ACH

468
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,247
System you can argue look if customers are okay with the system

469
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
And it works

470
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,599
10 great know we built this type in the 70s

471
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
We dealt a good pipe

472
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
It still works today

473
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
Why spend a bunch of money to replace it

474
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
What's something fancy

475
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,559
You could have said that any point hippie the cart and buggy works fine why do we need a car

476
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
What about the Concorde

477
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
Actually need to fly

478
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
Yeah but this isn't some booty

479
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,239
Product were talking about the entire world is moving

480
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,799
The only thing that isn't is the USB

481
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,359
Speed of light man

482
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,711
The right one thing if we have disclosed them simply because

483
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
People think it suits our needs

484
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,551
But you know there may be something else

485
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
More going on

486
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,159
There's a survey done by the consulting firm called Glenbrook

487
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,463
Which Elizabeth McQueary now works for

488
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,279
Is a survey of a bunch of people in this online payment

489
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
And they were asked

490
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,863
What do you think is the most important apps

491
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
Obstacle to implementing faster

492
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
Most respondents

493
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,239
Table is beside that

494
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
There be hassled

495
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
Systemic

496
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,847
But 20% of respondents

497
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Big Ripper

498
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Set it to differ

499
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,943
They thought the biggest obstacle was quote

500
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,247
Financial institution opposition

501
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
Due to cannibalization

502
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Existing

503
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,855
In other words if we upgrade the ACH

504
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
I will compete with

505
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Black wire tree

506
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Are fast

507
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,279
And I actually can tell you exactly how it's

508
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
Because there's a last part

509
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
The story of Art

510
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,911
Acura transferred it to a Chase account

511
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,959
Had to transfer it to an NPR back

512
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,031
The only way to do that was using a wire cutter

513
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
The cost

514
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
$30

515
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
$30

516
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
For sending data

517

Hey tits Jacob back here in 2018

534
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,536
Since we ran the show back in 2013

535
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
Of course the world has changed lots of people have started using apps like venmo beaming each other money from their phones

536
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
But

537
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,008
Banks are largely

538
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,336
Still using ACH still using that old system

539
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
Still generally take

540
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,944
Days to send money from One bank to another

541
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
But

542
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
That will change

543
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,344
We checked back in with Elizabeth McQueary to get the up

544
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:22,720
Achs giving itself a multiyear period To adapt

545
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,512
To the changes

546
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
And now

547
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,144
What we're saying is the final leg of this transition

548
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
And that is

549
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
To require

550
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:39,616
That the receiving institution makes those funds available to you as the consumer

551
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
Bye

552
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:47,040
5 p.m. so that it's truly a same-day payment to you as the receiver of the payment

553
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,856
In other words in just a couple of months

554
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,440
You will finally be able to move money from One bank to another

555
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,720
On the same day

556
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,768
Scores

557
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,096
The same day thing it only applies to work days not holidays

558
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:08,032
I'm actually super into payment I've been trying to figure out a

559
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
Another payment show to do

560
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,968

Alex goldmark is our senior producer Brian first at a theater

564
