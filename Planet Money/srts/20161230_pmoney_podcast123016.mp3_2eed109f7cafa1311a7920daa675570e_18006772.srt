00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,328
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Robert Smith

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,400
Let me tell you a secret about being a reporter

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,192
If it were not for deadlines

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,728
Reporters like myself

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:14,592
Would work on the same story for the rest of our lives the only way we get things done around here

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,360
Where is Denmark

7
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,408
But it does mean that sometimes

8
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,200
You don't have a real ending

9
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,016
To the story you're telling you just have to sort of

10
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,040
Figure out

11
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,320
Some kind of way

12
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,344
ATN podcast

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,184
Often times I wouldn't this often times we sort of end with a kind of

14
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,976
Time will tell

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
But not today

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
Today on the show

17
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
Time

18
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,120
Has

19
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,192
Call we follow up on our favorite stories of the year

20
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:44,544
And we find out what happened after we turned off our recorder after the deadline

21
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,872
It's an annual tradition we have here Planet Money named after a certain

22
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,896
Catchphrase

23
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,688
Of the radio Legend Paul Harvey

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712
Today

25
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
Together

26
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,784
You and I are going to learn

27
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
The rest of the story

28
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:01,696
The reason why this is my favorite time of year is because I get to do my Paul Harvey impression this is

29
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
The rest

30
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
Of the story

31
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,536

1626

51
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,200
I'll tell you this is not an easy year to recap

52
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
Because

53
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,528
Most of the big scary economic stories that we

54
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
We covered all year long

55
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,368
Still don't have endings to them

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
They're still teetering on the edge

57
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,488
United Kingdom Francis United Kingdom still has not pulled

58
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
Trigger

59
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
To leave the European Union

60
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
Puerto Rico still

61
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,864
Crushed under the massive debt

62
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
Venezuela still

63
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
Just a devastating tragic story

64
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
Still collapsing

65
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,080
I will be falling all of the stories well into 2017 and

66
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
Of course

67
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
Will be covering our brand new

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
New president

69
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
That's a wrap up

70
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,272
This year this year there are still a few podcast that we wanted to check back

71
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
First up

72
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
Wells Fargo

73
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:38,976
We did too big investigations into the bank along with NPR economics correspondent

74
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
Chris Arnold hey Chris hey Robert

75
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,376
So let's just quickly recap what we did in the two podcast

76
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
What did Wells Fargo do wrong

77
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,776
It's okay there was this big banking scandal at Wells Fargo that people have probably heard of where

78
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,080
Mega Million customers got credit cards in

79
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,640
Stuff that they didn't ask for it and that's terrible but

80
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,224
What we dug into and what I think is much more interesting

81
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
Is it was the employees

82
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,648
Themselves at this company who probably were hurt more than anyone else

83
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,952
And the way that happen

84
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
Is that we found

85
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:18,400
A number of folks who who resisted the sales pressure in the fraud and all the bad stuff that was going on inside the bank

86
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:24,800
Tell him even call the Ethics Line at the bank to say hey this is terrible is all this bad stuff going on around the office

87
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,640
And after they did that they were either pushed out or fired

88
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,200
And then the bank did something very

89
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Particular to them

90
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,808
It put what we call The Scarlet Letter

91
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,856
On their permanent record

92
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
It's called the u v is

93
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
With a permanent record

94
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
Griswold

95
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
And that prevented them

96
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
From getting a job

97
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,328
If any other bag is so we're just basically wrecked their career

98
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,912
Are we specifically for the story about a young man named Jeremy

99
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
Who had this

100
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
Scarlet Letter on his u5

101
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
And essentially had to

102
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,360
Change the part of the banking industry he was in and he knows

103
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,688
This bad Mark is still on his record

104
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:09,088
I try not to think about it to be honest with you

105
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
Scares the crap out of me I can everything that I've worked for these past eight years can be taken away from me because of this

106
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,887
When is because of this lie because of this this one statement that Wells Fargo in

107
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,983
Put on there he is it for him he's basically saying like this like a landmine

108
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
That could go off at any time

109
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
And Destroy his career

110
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:34,431
Landmine planted by his former employer by Wells Fargo right exactly Ed

111
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,527
So this caught the attention to a lot of people we got a lot of feedback on the story

112
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:43,391
And in particular this caught the attention of Senator Elizabeth Warren

113
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,951
Who as you probably know is for Massachusetts

114
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
And

115
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
She's

116
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,047
Made a name for himself obviously by

117
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,911
Challenging big powerful financial institutions and try to get reforms there

118
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
She is not somebody

119
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
You want to have

120
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
A firing

121
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,615
Off letters to your CEO and demanding answers and as a result of our stories

122
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
That's exactly what happened

123
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
We could report

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
On end

125
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
You're about

126
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
Employees

127
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
He said that Wells Fargo had

128
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Alligator

129
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
Against the music

130
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,207
Statements on there

131
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
U5

132
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
That we're not true

133
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
And the

134
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
That's what

135
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
God of Interest

136
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,935
And so we started looking at the

137
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
You fought

138
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
Statements that are

139
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
Then required

140
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
File

141
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,847
And didn't and finding

142
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,151
More and more evidence

143
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711
I'm a big problem that well

144
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,343
Increase when when someone says she's looking into this I mean that really means she's conducting an investigation

145
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,439
Right she's asked for documents from finra which is

146
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:54,815
The financial industry regulatory Authority at that sounds like a government agency is actually

147
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,399
Self-regulatory Industry Group but she's trying to get

148
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
All kinds of document

149
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,007
It's from them there the bank Industry Group that puts this Mark on the youth

150
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,823
Right they manage this whole u v system

151
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
So she's asking questions

152
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
Of finra

153
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,711
She sent a letter to Wells Fargo demanding

154
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
Answers in

155
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,831
And and wanting more information but I also she's making this bigger

156
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,135
Then Wells Fargo she's asking the question okay wait

157
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,439
How could this happen and

158
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,535
The fact that this did happen does that mean that we need some kind of Reform here

159
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
To fix the system

160
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
What's the catch with

161
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
When somebody says

162
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Problem

163
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
An employer didn't

164
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
Taccom

165
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,287
Well since you have taken the attitude

166
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,591
Is there something wrong here

167
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
The Whistleblower

168
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Problem

169
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,455
We should say there has been a few other

170
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,575
Get to progress after we are the podcast our Wells Fargo has talked about

171
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:53,183
At least intending to rehire some of the workers that perhaps were wrongly fired

172
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
We're following that and

173
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Finra

174
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
Has sort of at least acknowledge

175
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
Chris that

176
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
There might be a problem

177
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
With these

178
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,935
You fight with these reports with these black marks on people's record

179
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,567
We will definitely hear more about Wells Fargo in 2017 thanks Chris

180
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Oh you're welcome

181
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,759
It is my pleasure to bring in Jacob gold

182
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,575

183
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,367
In the fall about self

Check out machine

185
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415

Grocery stores

Put in

188

To I don't know

189
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,303
To make my life easier if you scan your groceries yourself

190
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,143
And then it breaks and they call over the store employee to fix it and then you walk out

191
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Who sings All This Time

192
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:41,311
That's the theory anyway so for this story as you may recall Nick Fountain I we went up to

193
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Toronto

194
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,895
Are we talk to the inventor of the self-checkout machine

195
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,479
We also talked about the future of self checkout

196
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,807
And for that part of the show we talked to somebody named Dusty

197
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
You were to NCR that's a big

198
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
Company that's working on this.

199
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,207
And just see what he described first like his vision

200
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,023
He's like this is the store of the future

201
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,839
Do you need the scanner Could you actually not have

202
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,167
More cameras in artificial intelligence behind the cameras

203
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
Actually know that

204
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
We just saw you pick an item up from this

205
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Part of the Shelf

206
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
And we know

207
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
That that's where

208
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
The

209
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
The baked beans are

210
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
And therefore automatically add that

211
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
To your order

212
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:24,319
That's as frictionless as you can get you walk in the store you pick up your items you walk out

213
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
No cash register a dog that's right

214
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
And you think that'll actually happen

215
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
That will happen

216
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,535
Yeah the questions will that happen in 2020 or that happen in 2030

217
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,423
And all I get is baked beans so this would solve all of my problems store that sells baked beans

218
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
With lasers

219
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,007
So this is Juneau the dusty let's vision

220
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:47,359
When you talk to text people they always have their like utopian vision of the few

221
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
Futurama Netflix

222
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
Never really

223
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
Come so he says all this and I'm

224
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
But

225
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
Robert Smith

226
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,343
Amir 48 days

227
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
Less than 2 months

228
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
After this podcast aired

229
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
Amazon

230
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
Evian amazon.com

231
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
Announced a new project

232
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
Welcome

233
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:13,471
To Amazon go use the Amazon Go app to enter Then

234
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,871
Put away your phone and start shopping it's really that simple to Robert Amazon

235
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,431
What store is like a little 7-Eleven

236
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
And it works

237
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,039
Just like Dusty lots of NCR told us

238
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
The store of the future would work

239
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,975
Once you got everything you want you can just go when you leave are just walk out technology

240
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
Adds up your virtual card and charges your Amazon account you receive it sent straight to the app and you can keep

241
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,775
Go it Amazon go no lines no checkout

242
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:52,383
Apparently with the store needed was not necessary technology but lots of buzzwords like

243
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Just walk out technology

244
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:59,039
And then let's do do do-do-do-do do-do-do-do do-do-do-do

245
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Do we know how to do it

246
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
Amazon is glad you asked

247
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:08,511
So how does it work we use computer vision deep learning algorithms

248
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,095
Interfusion much like you find at self-driving cars

249
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
I have no idea what the

250
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:18,239
I suspect there's a lot of workers on closed-circuit cameras just lay like

251
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
Two cans of beans

252
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:25,151
I should I should say we just put one more note of skepticism the my skepticism apparently just got approved on butt

253
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
This is an ad

254
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
The store is not open yet

255
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
But it's supposed to be open

256
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,063
In early 2017 a real store

257
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
In Seattle washing

258
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
Thank you Jacob Happy New Year

259
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Our last check in

260
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,095
On the rest of the story is with

261
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Stacy fan

262
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,935
X-Men Stacy hi Robert we did a podcast

263
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
A year ago

264
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,775
Now that was about ice

265
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
And more specifically was about

266
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
The economics of Isis

267
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:00,479
Yes Isis is a horse the terrorist group that is occupied territory in Syria and Iraq

268
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,575
And we spoke with a man who lived in an Isis controlled town

269
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,903
Muhammad ketterer and his hometown is deir ezzor

270
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,999
And he told us a little bit about the economics of living in an Isis can

271
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
Control tower

272
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
He said Isis members you

273
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
Use dollars in

274
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
A lot of money to throw around and stores in tears or sorrow

275
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
Catering to them

276
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
Selling a lot of really

277
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
Western items

278
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,335
Things like energy drinks and Axe Body Spray and candy bars

279
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,895
Twix that's kind of fancy Goods

280
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
Twix

281
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,247
Twix Twix bars like only

282
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,807
Only Isis Fighters get to eat Twix bars

283
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,415
This amazing things this podcast was

284
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,231
Muhammad story he actually been recruited

285
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
To work for ice

286
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,327
Yes to design a logo for their news age

287
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
This is a graphic designer

288
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Exactly

289
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
And after that he was asked to join Isis and

290
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
E flat

291
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
And when we talked to him he was in Turkey

292
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,823
He since left turkey at his now in Germany with his face

293
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
Family

294
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,991
Although he still in touch with people indira's or his hometown and he said things there are mostly the same but they have gotten

295
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
Worst

296
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,343
What is the things he said was the tax-collecting has gotten more aggressive

297
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,135
And now Isis is demanding

298
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
Taxes in the special

299
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
Currency that it meant

300
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
Getting used to demand

301
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
A ton of taxes in either

302
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,607
Syrian money or in US dollars

303
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:25,471
Exactly but I started making its own coins out of gold and silver and copper

304
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,287
And it sells these coins to jewelry stores

305
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,103
And people have to go to jewelry stores and buy them

306
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,943
So that when Isis members show up at their house demanding money

307
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
They can pay them in the special Isis

308
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
So Isis members

309
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,111
Self still use dollars but everybody has to pay Isis

310
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Indy special

311
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
So Isis

312
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
Makes money

313
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
By minting money

314
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
Visalia to the people and then under threat of death

315
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,863
Demands the money back from them in Texas

316
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Yes

317
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Evil Genius

318
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
Yeah Evil Genius

319
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,519
Muhammad himself is doing pretty well

320
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
He has a new baby

321
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,151
He's trying to learn German but he says he still misses deer Azure everyday and

322
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
He says

323
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
The second Isis leaves

324
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
He and his family will go back

325
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Thank you Stacey

326
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Because I have a

327
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Surprise

328
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Color for you on the line

329
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Okay

330
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Hello

331
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Json

332
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:24,095
Yes Jason Bruns the man who are you guys

333
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,191
Ice bite everyone with me in 2016 Planet Money

334
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
Got into the oil bill

335
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,519
We got into it hard we bought

336
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
100 barrels of 00

337
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:39,711
I thought we fancy well people cocktail

338
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
At $40 a barrel

339
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,295
And we lost a ton of money doing

340
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
You should go back and listen if you

341
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Not have the check

342
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,951
And when we last left your Json you were standing in a muddy oil field

343
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
With our money

344
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
Where are you right now

345
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
Phoenix Arizona

346
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
What are you doing in Phoenix

347
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
A vacation

348
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,215
We're just down here doing a lot of golfing

349
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
I love eating

350
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,823
I suspect that this vacation was paid for by

351
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
The Planet Money

352
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,663
Incompetent at buying oil

353
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,319
Well I don't think that quite got it it did probably help me by one of my steak dinner so I'm not going to lie

354
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,135
Probably didn't do much on anything else

355
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,999
A lot has happened in the oil world since we lost money and left a business

356
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
OPEC

357
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:29,119
The oil cartel agreed to limited production of oil which sent the price

358
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
Shooting up

359
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,983
About the same oil that we bought it $40 a barrel is now fetching

360
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
40

361
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
$6 a barrel

362
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,151
If we had a way to keep that oil we could have made a huge profit but of course we did

363
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
Where we at

364
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:48,319
If you to put it in bottles and sold it like a quarter to time on your show you probably done better

365
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
You're right

366
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,463
Json when we last left you you had

367
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
Shut down one of your wells

368
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
Because of the low oil

369
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
Yes and you did not feel great

370
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
No no

371
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,751
Spell I didn't but I did start it up the next month

372
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,567
I started up and ran it long enough to

373
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
Does may contain call

374
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
Disable to keep the lease

375
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
And you know what make it wasn't

376
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,991
Profitable so to save at least I broke even

377
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,551
You told us that you did not

378
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,463
Sort of get up in the morning and check the price of oil you didn't follow all the news because it was creating

379
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
Stress and Anxiety

380
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
But that was when the prices going down

381
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,607
When the price is going up are you more excited to

382
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,423
Check your phone check the news check the price every hour

383
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,495
So not every hour but I check it every day

384
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
It is still amazing

385
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
To be

386
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
How all these things in the world

387
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,919
Can affect the price of oil

388
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
In Kansas

389
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,527
You know I an OPEC meeting in Geneva or rumors about

390
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063

391
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
Iran more harsh

392
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
Do you like that that can determine

393
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
Whether or not

394
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463

There's a lot of Smith's in the world to stop writing to ask
