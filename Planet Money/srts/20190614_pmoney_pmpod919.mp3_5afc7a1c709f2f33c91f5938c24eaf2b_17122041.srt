1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,792
Good morning

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,328
The actor Kurt Russell

3
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:05,120
Does Square One Time

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,192
Who are you and

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,728
What are you arguing and why

6
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:15,872
Greg I'm going to Simpson I live in Hot Springs Village Arkansas small rule Community outside Hot Springs

7
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,152
And how are you

8
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:17,920
But

9
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,944
Big cities

10
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,736
Simply aren't worth the cost

11
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,576
I can continue but that's usually the kind of clip you use

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,928
Dennis Simpson clearly knows how a Planet Money episode works

13
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
He is a list

14
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,488
And he sent us an email

15
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
With an ARG

16
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,816
That stems from the fact that

17
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,120
His life in Hot Springs Village Ark

18
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,168
Chainsaw is apparently

19
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
Freaking

20
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:45,056
Great it is 26000 Acres of complete awesome

21
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:45,824
Golf courses

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,104
11

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,968
Lakes I'm looking across our Lake right now it's not the largest lake in the village but it's very nice

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,624
Over that hill and over the hill behind it is 1.7 million Acres of National Forest in the water

25
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Mountain Valley Water is bottled about 6 miles from here we have some of the purest water in the United States

26
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,840
And it says Hot Springs Village

27
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
Is cheap

28
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
Especially when he

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
He Compares it to places like

30
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
New York

31
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
Or Sanford Zoo

32
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,824
We watch the realtor.com and we watch the Zillow actually got to link the other day

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
For a

34
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,384
Quarter acre lot

35
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,432
With a dead truck

36
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,456
A deadbolt

37
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:28,064
And a cinder block 800 square foot house that was 1.2 million dollars

38
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
In the Bay Area

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,720
And we joke about that that's a $30,000 redneck home to us that

40
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
You would never live in that

41
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,328
Temperature to boil down your argument

42
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
Cities are overrated

43
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
I think cities are overrated

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,448
I really do

45
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
They're overrated

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,616
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Kenny Malone and I'm Greg results

47
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,688
The conventional wisdom from Economist has been

48
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
If you want to Make It in America

49
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
Move to the city

50
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
But in the last few years

51
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,088
People have been leaving City

52
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
Cities like New York

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,416
In San Francisco and Miami

54
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
And Los Angeles

55
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,976
Today on the show

56
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
Are cities overrated

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
Is it time to rethink

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Where to live

Today we are going to talk

80
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
Due to the country's leading economy

81
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,560
To ask the question

82
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
How do cities become / 8

83
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,656
No they're not overrated

84
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:24,800
They do amazing things and they have been doing amazing things for thousands of years Ed Glazer is an economist at Harvard

85
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
And wrote a pretty popular book about City

86
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
These called Triumph

87
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:34,016
Of the city what was the subtitle of that trying for the city how our greatest invention makes us

88
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,088
Smarter healthier hold on let me get

89
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
Make sure I have to eat have the adjectives in order for you

90
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
There a lot of hair

91
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
Ed Glazer for decades has been

92
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
One of the

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
Biggest cheerleaders

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Four cities

95
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,192
Trying for the city how I greatest invention makes us richer smarter Greener healthier and happier

96
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,008
Play circle up in Manhattan in the 1970s and 1980s

97
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,080
Which wasn't the most glamorous time for New York

98
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,640
Or really any of the country's major cities

99
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,456
Cities had been these manufacturer

100
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Hap's pit

101
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
During that. The world

102
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Kind of opened up

103
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,368
New York's garment industry went overseas for example

104
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
Detroit car business started shriveling up

105
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,976
The crime rates in cities skyrocketed

106
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
Cities became

107
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
A place where

108
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Where scary things happen

109
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
And or at least that was the

110
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,287
New York the entire city

111
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,383
If you've ever seen the movie Escape From New York the scary plot is

112
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
It's the future

113
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
1997

114
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,015
And the president has crashed in New York City

115
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
And must be rescue

116
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
You can win

117
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,391
Find a president bring them out in 24 hours

118
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
You're a free man

119
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
24 hours

120
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
Make a new one

121
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Bulshit

122
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Straight just like I said

123
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
This movie was part of like a whole genre

124
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,191
Of dystopian New York City movies

125
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
Came out in the 70s

126
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:02,079
It really felt as if the age of the city at

127
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,383
Come and gone was not going to come again

128
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
And that was really the back. That was the world that I grew up in

129
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,783
And from that perspective The Comeback of cities feels fairly

130
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
The reason cities came back is because

131
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,439
There was this whole wave jobs that came in the 90s in the 2000s

132
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,767
They're all part of what a condom is sometimes called knowledge

133
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
I think like Finance

134
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
Biotech coding

135
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,703
Instead of making a new physical object with your muscles

136
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,799
This is the kind of job where you give the world a new idea with your brain

137
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
These types of jobs

138
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Ed Glazer says

139
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Thrive

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
Live in dense urban area

141
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
Is old Urban Edge

142
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
Enabling Act

143
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:46,111
Get smart by being around other smart people that older bananas became more valuable

144
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
And it was on that

145
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Advantage

146
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
Did cities found himself coming back

147
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,815
There is the stunning statistic in Blazers book about this modern economy

148
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,983
Please are found the Americans who live in big metropolitan areas are 50% more productive than their small

149
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Mooretown equivale

150
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,823
Glaser along with a lot of economist

151
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,407
Best tips spent decades trying to figure out why this is like

152
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
What exactly is the magic

153
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Of a city

154
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
And he says for sure some of it is this

155
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
Self-selection

156
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,879
Where you got high Achievers trying to make it in

157
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,695
Play Store says even when you take that into account

158
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,303
There's something about a city that seems to make workers better at their job

159
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,887
So the key point is that all of

160
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,423
Human creativity

161
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,727
Is based on the Bedrock of human interaction

162
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
Almost everything of what

163
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
I know I've learned from people around me

164
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,455
Physical proximity speeds the flow of ideas and city's been enabling

165
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,807
The collaborative change of creativity that are powered Humanity's greatest hits from

166
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
Athenian philosophy to Facebook

167
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,183
So these are fundamentally enablers of human creativity

168
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,999
And now it's not like every city in the country

169
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,791
Has rebounded from the 70s

170
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Canady's the same

171
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,119
And this is why you'll hear Economist talk about

172
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,167
So-called Super Star City

173
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,471
The rare economic term

174
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,543
It sounds like it should be a song from the band

175
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
Superstar City

176
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Are these

177
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,431
Places like San Francisco New York and Seattle

178
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,039
Places accounting for a disproportionate share of a country's economic growth

179
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:25,439
Over the last decade are biggest cities have accounted for over 70% of the nation's job growth

180
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,279
In other words the cities aren't just driving our economy

181
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,327
They are kind of becoming

182
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
Alright so are we are we ready to go

183
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,703
Yes okay this is David daughter

184
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
He's a labor economist

185
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Mist at MIT

186
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,543
I'm also the

187
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,335
Co-director of the MIT

188
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
Work of the future task force

189
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,431
David told us another reason why cities

190
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,503
It's that when you look back through history

191
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
They have this incredible power to give opportunities to

192
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,183
Even workers who did not have specialized skills or College

193
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
Agree

194
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
For these types of workers David

195
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,815
Moving to the city would actually change the kind of work

196
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
You do as you

197
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,911
Went from rural areas to suburbs

198
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
Metro areas to City

199
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
There's a kind of an occupational escalator

200
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
The non-college workers rude

201
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
This is the classic

202
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,383
Start in the Mailroom and work your way up store

203
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,199
The data show that if you move to a city

204
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,015
The odds of this happening we're just way better

205
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,367
You leave a small town and step onto this big city career Escalade

206
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,671
And workers would benefit with

207
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,767
Or without a degree it would arguably be building more skills

208
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
And I developing a unit

209
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
Especializacion that would

210
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,191
Exit more productive that would cause her wages to be higher and it would give them more

211
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,727
Optical job security over

212
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
Hey look I'm from a small town in

213
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,103
This is exactly what I grew up assuming

214
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
To be true assuming

215
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,943
Bit the quickest path to Upward Mobility

216
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,759
Was packing my bags and moving to a big city

217
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,855
Actually I think most Economist assume that to that is the conventional bison

218
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Is is that what you think

219
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,207
That's what I thought you know up until 6 months ago

220
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
After the break

221
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303

To give

231
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,471
What was probably one of the biggest speeches of his life

Everything it was incredibly intivity Ben Bernanke is

243
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Is the former chairman of

244
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
The Federal Reserve

245
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
He sent me an email he sent you an email

246
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,471
He's like I want you to give this prestigious lecture

247
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,567
Where does your mind go so you know the first place my mind went was

248
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,407
Can I delete this email and pretended it has never caught

249
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,967
Because this is going to be really hard

250
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503

Email from Ben Bernanke I would like to do now is

254
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
Introduce red lecture

255
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
David otter

256
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:44,351
I was actually there for the speech it was in Atlanta it was a huge convention room full of hundreds

257
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Economist

258
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,191
Diva daughter takes the same kind of nervously smiling

259
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Thank you

260
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
It is a

261
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
Overwhelming honor

262
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
To be early starts talking about how we starting to rethink

263
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
The popular wisdom

264
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Insidious

265
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
So when I started this project

266
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
That was my

267
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
Assumption

268
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,599
Cities are land of opportunity we are rising

269
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,647
That's where we should go why is everyone moving to

270
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
Remember moving to the city

271
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,255
Got you access to that career Escalade

272
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
Free speech

273
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
David did some new research

274
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
In the first big surprise

275
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,423
Was it this career escalator

276
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
It have been flattening out

277
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
For decades

278
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
Another word that was steeply upward sloping in the 1970s

279
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
1980s

280
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,383
Starting 1990s it starts to

281
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
Rotate downward

282
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:35,295
Further show in 2004 they're still so that by 2015 that escalator

283
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
Had complete

284
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
Fleetly

285
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
Leveled out

286
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
Moving to the city date

287
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,255
Is now more like one of those moving walkways at the airport

288
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
There is no moving up

289
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Like I used to

290
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
And so the big question is

291
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
Why is

292
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
That's what changed

293
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,519
And the answer has to do with something at David and actually been looking at for a long

294
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,127
Our country's labor market has been splitting into two tiers

295
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
Number one

296
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,967
You got high paying knowledge-based jobs

297
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
Two number two

298
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
Low-paying service-sector

299
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
The stuff that used to be in the middle tier

300
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,415
That is the stuff that has proved

301
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
Easy to automate with

302
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
Technology or offshore with

303
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,559
You know free trade but this was just a general national tree

304
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
For this fancy speech in Atlanta

305
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,959
David decided he wanted to see how this was unfolding across America

306
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
Where exactly

307
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,055
In the country are these middle care jobs disappearing

308
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
Expected to see them.

309
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
Disappearing everywhere

310
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,199
Especially in rural areas and smaller declining cities

311
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Like those in the Rust Belt

312
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
Places that were obviously sucks

313
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
David assumed the exception to this would be

314
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,135
In ARP Superstar cities

315
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
That's where

316
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
All the benefits of

317
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
Silicon Valley or Finance

318
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,535
Los Angeles her spilling over to everybody

319
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,351
You know just get there the cup runneth over and everyone is

320
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
Part of this

321
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
Concentrated prosperity

322
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
What would David had found

323
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
What is presenting

324
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
In his speech

325
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
What's the exact opposite

326
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
This job polarization

327
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,223
This division of the labor market into high-paying and low-paying tears is now happening more in Superstar cities

328
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
Been anywhere else in the country

329
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:15,647
This job polarization is urban phenomenon

330
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
Until about 72 hours

331
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,791
I have been telling you

332
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
People

333
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,887
We got to get everyone to move to cities cuz that's where the opportunity is

334
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
I'm less certain of that

335
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
Then I was

336
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
72 hours

337
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,031
This was pretty Bonkers to hear live

338
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:37,919
You know it wasn't like Ben Bernanke was spitting out his drink and the audience was sobbing uncontrollably

339
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,783
But deep Sauter was onstage challenging this decades-old economic truths

340
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
Go to the city

341
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
If you want to make

342
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
You were saying

343
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,183
That simply isn't true for a huge segment of the work

344
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
It was kind of

345
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
Jaja

346
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
I got your job was slightly on the floor mine was you know like I couldn't get off the floor for weeks at a time

347
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
So surprised

348
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
David Pink Floyd

349
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,775
Dark picture of what's going on in Superstar cities

350
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,103
You have this talk to your job is doing better and better

351
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
Then you have that lower-tier of jobs

352
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,455
Non-college workers are primarily there to

353
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:15,295
UC to the care and comfort and feeding and security of the more affluent

354
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
They have been

355
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
Shuffled

356
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,159
Into these jobs that use

357
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Arguably

358
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
More generic skills

359
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
And that's why

360
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,863
It's hard for them to command High wages because the set of people can do many of those tasks

361
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
Is

362
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Abandon

363
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
And since David daughter gave this

364
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
And revealed these fine

365
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
I think there has been a wave of follow-up

366
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,103
Most recently a group of economist

367
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
At Cleveland fed

368
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
Tried to calculate where you should go live

369
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
Depending on what you do

370
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
And what they found is that

371
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,855
If you do not have to be in a superstar City to do your job

372
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
Probably should not go

373
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
Do a superstar set

374
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,743
And so the question that started this entire up

375
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
How do cities become over rate

376
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
We put that directly to David daughter

377
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Depends for whom

378
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,935
They're overrated for

379
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
Adults at college tours

380
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
They're probably not overrated

381
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
For how to get your

382
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
David says

383
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
That means cities are overrated

384
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,199
Protest about one in every three work

385
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,503
For about a third of the country

386
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
Cities are now

387
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Allowed

388
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
But they're still the other 2/3

389
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
At the moment

390
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,183
There's a lot of opportunity for

391
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,255
You know skill specialized creative work

392
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,839
In dense urban areas that are just not yet nearly as available

393
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:36,191
In Hot Springs Arkansas although I'm sure Hot Springs Arkansas author Whoppers Mini

394
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,239
Wonderful things are not available in New York

395
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,055
9 golf courses 11 Lake water as

396
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Charette

397
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,407
The driven snow will a 2 + 1

398
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
Dennis Simpson

399
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,783
To listen to We started this whole thing by claiming cities are overrated

400
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
We called him back

401
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
And we explained

402
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,135
Basically he was right

403
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,951
If you don't have a diploma or some specialized

404
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,487
In-demand skill set

405
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
Cities are not the place

406
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,119
I'm actually kind of living that process just a minute

407
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
Simpson though

408
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,471
Cities probably are not

409
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Overrated

410
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,287
For him personally

411
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,847
Because what dentist does for a living

412
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
Is run a tech

413
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,175
In your line of business like

414
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
Will it come into the city make a lot of sense

415
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
When do you make a lot of money

416
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,343
Oh yeah yeah yeah no question I do I've never argued that point

417
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
Nm4

418
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,463
15 years I had like the third largest IT company in Little Rock

419
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
And my joke was I had 16 employees and 17 headache

420
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
I didn't miss

421
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Any part of that

422
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,655
No part of that whatsoever do I miss

423
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
We cannot commit

424
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
You just doesn't like C

425
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,287
He wants something as he puts it holistic

426
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
Holistic is getting up in the morning

427
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,711
Walking outside and seeing the bald eagle in the tree literally 15 feet from my dick

428
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,271
There are bald eagle sightings in New York City

429
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
Although

430
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,855
We looked it up in the last story we could find about

431
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
A sighting was

432
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Two thousand

433
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
Lowe's in Staten Island

434
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,631
When a bunny has a brand-new newsletter if you are not

435
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:14,239
And in fact Gregory goralski is the brains behind the newsletter Greg

436
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,543
Becomes what once a week comes once a week

437
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,151
It's usually about some big thing in the news or some big economic idea
