00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,855
I'm going to follow Jose around tonight because he is a legend

129
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,927
You think I'm a legend 6 years ago when I was working there

130
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,231

131

132
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
That's what tonight I am stoked

133
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,375
To figure out what he's going to pick and his strategy in deciding what

134
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
Jose's number

135
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
The twentieth of never

136
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,239
Gets to sell beer at

137
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
And yet

138
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,335
He consistently sells more product

139
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
Than anyone else

140
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
The parkway

141
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
Which means more Commission

142
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:16,319
What's your ranking commissioned last year before before

143
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,439
If I were a betting man I would bet that Jose is going to have the highest Commission

144
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
You can tell just by looking at him he's a good sales

145
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,399
He's got the deep and what she told us he got spending a few weeks of spring training selling items down there and we keep

146
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
Pestering him

147
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,239
Until we get him to admit

148
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
I consider myself

149
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
The best

150
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
Reason Jose is the best

151
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Because he doesn't just

152
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Guess what he's

153
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,503
He is meticulous about

154
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,831
Even has a spreadsheet at home where he analyzes

155
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
What picks work the best

156
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
Jose doesn't just look at the temperature

157
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
When you mix it

158
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,255
He evaluates who else is selling his prime

159
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
How many guys are selling it

160
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,095
Who's the possible guys are up against

161
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,887
Elizabeth difference of

162
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,703
Mike is really good meme I keep trying not to sell

163
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
With each other

164
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
Oh cuz it's competition

165
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
Jose looked at the list

166
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Has it all in his head

167
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
It makes it

168
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
I'll take dogs

169
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,271
In the bleachers you just took hot dogs out of waitress

170
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
Call Matt Mobley

171
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
Donkey Kong

172
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
After Jose pics

173
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,415
The next year they with the cold weather play

174
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Coco's gone

175
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
They're hoping no one brought their heavy jacket

176
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,071
Kateri home

177
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,375
I'm going to take a pizza in the bleachers

178
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
What is Robert

179
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
Just picking what they're selling

180
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
Tonight they're picking the territory

181
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
So like hot dogs at a home

182
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
Pizza in the bleachers

183
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,711
It's because they're sizing up their customers by how much they paid for their baseball team

184
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,807
When I was working there Diet Coke sold really well around home plate

185
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
Cuz you know that's where the vein people sit

186
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,159
Coke regular Coke sold much better in the blue

187
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,975
Now I know Nick that you are rooting

188
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,815
For your idol Jose he is the best he's that

189
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:09,471
He's the Derek Jeter Pedro Martinez Pedro Martinez of

190
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,751
Vendors at Fenway

191
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
But I

192
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
Have a good feeling about some of the younger

193
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,615
Talent tonight

194
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:20,223
While those old guys have been here forever they're getting their sweet Pixar beer at home

195
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,527
There are some lean and hungry

196
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,087
Teenager standing in the back of the garage just

197
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Waiting for

198
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,695
Hi my name is Mitchell lion I'm a vendor at Fenway Park

199
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
And you have been working how long here

200
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
About two weeks

201
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,351
5 games

202
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
Which is a senior in high school

203
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Call Kids R

204
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
You smile

205
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,799
It has the new guy he will choose almost near the end of the list

206
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,615
He doesn't even think about picking hot dogs or beer

207
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
You're out of his League

208
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:54,015
What's the dream like maybe people didn't show up maybe play a different is there a dream for today well

209
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:59,135
Peanuts I could probably get I've heard people getting peanuts on their first year they make very good money off of that

210
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,487
So if for some reason there's peanut there tonight

211
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Have you ever thrown them before

212
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,607
But I can figure that one out pretty easily

213
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,447
There is no way he's going to get peanuts today

214
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,263
Add to work for three years before I could sell peanut

215
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
But you can see the pitches mph

216
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
Younger

217
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
He's the new Jose if he can just

218
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Get a good pic

219
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
Mitch goes second-to-last

220
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
And he has

221
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
Two choices

222
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,343
He could sell this season's newest product

223
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
Cheetos

224
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
Popcorn

225
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,047
Apparently you will get heckled by the Boston fat if you run up and down the stand screaming Cheetos popcorn

226
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
Or is that the choice is

227
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Water

228
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
In the cheeks

229
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
I'll take water out of bluetooth on

230
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,239
Mitch's in for a really long night

231
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,103
Some of my worst memories from this job we're selling cold drinks on a really cold night

232
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
It was terrible

233
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
Mitch has a plan

234
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,527
You basically just have to yell water you get your water here ice cold water

235
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
I'm going to give you a tip that I learned working here

236
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,159
It's a cold night don't say ice cold

237
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,559
Sure thing I can do that warm water

238
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Do the kid learns fast

239
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
He is smart

240
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
Mitch is the underdog

241
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
Good luck with that

242
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,847
The pic is officially over

243
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,663
Everyone grabs their stuff to put in the uniform which is base

244
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Basically this bright

245
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:32,063
Yellow t-shirt each T-shirt has a specific number on the back Jose the legend he's number one

246
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
Admits the rookie selling water hundred

247
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,927
They had to some kitchens to pick up their product

248
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
And we had up to the stand to watch the game

249
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
Annabelle

250
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,191
Next time you're at a ballgame I recommend you look away from the game

251
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Winchester

252
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
Watch

253
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
The vendors

254
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
They are

255
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
Amazing

256
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,151
Every second count because every second they can save

257
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,991
Running up the stairs are running down the stairs are doing a quicker more efficient transaction

258
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
If another second they could use

259
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
Define another customer

260
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,879
To make another sale it was really hard work

261
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,975
The first yard work there I just switch from glasses to contacts cuz I was sweating so much

262
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,303
I'm still watching super efficient system here

263
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
Yeah but it wasn't always like this

264
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,911
When I worked here and there was a manager in the corporate office

265
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,983
She decided at the beginning of that what mix of products are being so

266
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:26,591
Three guys selling Coke out of right field to Cotton Candy guys in the bleachers

267
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Top down

268
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,223
What are the suits know at Aramark the vendors are the ones

269
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
You can feel the temperature

270
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
Airdrop 5

271
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
Subtly read

272
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,623
The mood of the crowd when there's no bobblehead giveaway

273
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,743
Yeah by letting them run the pick by having their paychecks dependent on how much they sell

274
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,815
They figure out the best allocation of the product

275
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
It makes way more sense that the vendors make

276
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
Decision if they have all the information

277
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,983
High enough. I want to go see how our guys are doing

278
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
Okay it's been really hard

279
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
To chase down

280
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Jose

281
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,943
The number one performer the self-proclaimed

282
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Best Ben-Hur

283
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,623
In the ballpark Rhapsody knighted states begin boots really fast really fast but we finally set up here the bleacher so we can watch

284
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,255
Watch him work he scans back and forth you see somebody he put down his box and hotdogs

285
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,839
Wax paper

286
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,375
There goes the dog

287
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Call you

288
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
That was like 3 seconds

289
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
Yeah going slow today though

290
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,431
Hello call Nicole

291
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711

292
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
Spell divorce law at someone

293
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
You give me 20

294
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,903
He's the Master look at how quick to give the change

295
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,719
Looking around nope no sales he runs down

296
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:53,119
Boom boom boom boom boom cat takes a very spry man to run downstairs

297
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
If somebody grab them

298
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
Wax paper bun

299
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
There goes the dog

300
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:06,431
In his hand and he has the money in his other hand while he's making the hot dog

301
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
Hygienic

302
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
A hot dog

303
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,063
A lot of money

304
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,903
He tried his best

305
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,207
How about now

306
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
So nice

307
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,303
Amazing watch a master at work

308
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
A dog

309
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
I noticed something about Jose

310
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,959
As soon as he makes the sale he is scared in the crowd

311
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,775
Annies looking not just for other sales but for his

312
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Competitors

313
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
You can see him run up to a mile

314
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,175
Spot another hot dog vendor in the aisle in immediately pivot and pick another song

315
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
You don't run to where the hot dog is

316
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,087
You run to where the hot dog is going to be

317
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,439
You are vending Guru

318
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
Let's see how my pic

319
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Mitch the underdog the rookie

320
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
What's the heaviest weight

321
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
Alright head up the stairs

322
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
Look up

323
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,519
Robert is pretty exhausted right terrible

324
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
Welcome to the cheap seats

325
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
High up in the bleachers

326
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
So this is the section that Mitch has chosen

327
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,015
To sell his water in like this is his territory tonight

328
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
And

329
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,695
We're watching him down there he's got his water he just is about to make a cell looks like he went out of use how's your day

330
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,023
So far

331
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
You guys have a good night

332
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,423
Yes but looking up slowly is with the money just like

333
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,519
He doesn't have the technique that has water over

334
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
Yours too

335
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,895
1050 is going to be a change

336
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Oh my God

337
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,783
Struggle with that money there

338
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
Hope you enjoy today

339
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,647
Okay it is a little bit of a rough night permit

340
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
I will admit

341
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
I see a lot of potential here

342
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
And

343
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,047
His whole life struggling with the water struggling with the change thing

344
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
Sympathy

345
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,655
From the crowd I saw one gentleman give him a nice

346
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
She just gave him a little tip

347
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,263
It's a lot of stairs up here

348
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
I will see the vendors are not

349
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
Eager

350
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Talk about

351
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,151
Their tips but Clues have to be

352
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
E major Park

353
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,271
Yeah Summers I was working there I had no shortage of

354
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
Of cash money in my wall

355
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,671
There's a reason why if you notice at the park the price for water is 475

356
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,767
A hot dog is 5:50 until when you were there did you really like slow roll.

357
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,327
Yeah when I was working there I was selling

358
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,399
Coke and diet coke a lot it was for 25 so to give

359
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,727
Two-person $5 back and then I would hold up the quarters and I would say

360
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
Hey guy you want your quarters like

361
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
You want me to pass these three

362
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,151
Dirty metal objects down this road of people

363
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Keep the quote

364
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,551
Nick there is a real economic

365
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
Lesson here

366
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
About the fundamental nature of competition

367
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02,303
It turned out hold up we're going to interrupt the podcast we're going to sing Sweet Caroline Boston tradition

368
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Please

369
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
What was that you were saying Robert

370
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,887
I would like to get to make a serious point about productivity gains and

371
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,983
Distributed decision-making and ruthless efficiency of process

372
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
I did notice some

373
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
If past 9 p.m.

374
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
The Red Sox are up 73 against the Rays

375
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
Play the crowd is sort of starting to go home

376
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
Most of the vendors are done for the day

377
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,807
Night they're down below counting their money eating leftover hot dogs and

378
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,135
Mitch the rookie the underdog he's nowhere to be

379
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,439
But you know who is still around

380
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Jose

381
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,023
Jose is still hustling

382
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,815
In fact he is the last

383
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Bender

384
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,399
In the park and because he has no competition

385
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
He has left

386
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
The bleachers

387
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,263
It is a sight to see he's doing his whole Loop of the stadium

388
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
First base

389
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Home

390
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,383
3rd Base everyone's territory running up and down the stairs

391
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Sing the last hot dog

392
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
The last face

393
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
It's always like this is

394
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,319
Is why Jose is the best he just stays out longer

395
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,647
He works harder than everyone else this is what I came here looking

396
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,951
Looking for thought it was the spreadsheet of the strategy

397
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,815
No it's really just hustling harder Jose is the last Bender to return from the stands

398
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
He's the last with the cash out

399
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,655
He's the last one hang up his number one

400
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Yellow shirt

401
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
At any point

402
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
Today did you watch

403
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,799
Any of the game did you look out on the stadium or

404
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
Twice

405
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,967
I'll check the ending to see where I'm at how much time I have left to sell and I'll take your time as well

406
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,831
There was one play that something happened looked up it was

407
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
It was all done for

408
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
Weber playing tonight

409
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,743
Feels like today

410
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
Now I don't know if I could

411
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
You spent 3 hours in a ballpark

412
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
Huge baseball fan

413
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,983
Yeah my chosen today

414
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,799
It's the Tampa Bay Rays

415
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,127
That feels about right

416
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,455
I think he was deeply embarrassed by this but

417
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:32,575
Let nothing be embarrassed about we got his final numbers he sold 270

418
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,647
Hot dog 270 hot dogs that works at 2

419
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
$1,500

420
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Worth of hotdogs

421
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
We did the math

422
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
He probably made a commission of round

423
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
200 200 $50

424
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,119
Maybe we're guessing here you got

425
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
$150 in tips

426
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,727
Bottom line somewhere in the ballpark of 400

427
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
Not bad for a cold winter

428
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
What Jose called the worst

429
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Night of the year

430
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,639
Mitchell rookie water kid

431
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
Are Underdog

432
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,479
He left early I mean he's a high school student

433
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
Hit long train ride back

434
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
The suburbs where he lives

435
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
Parents don't like him staying out too late

436
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
But we called him up to see how his night with

437
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
Haymitch hello

438
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:12,255
Hello how's it going dude says he had a much better night

439
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
How many Waters did you end up selling

440
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
96

441
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,655
Es6 not bad for a newbie

442
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:24,799
He told us he probably made sixty bucks in commission and we're guessing here but maybe 20 or $30 in tips

443
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,359
Some idiot $90 for a couple hours work

444
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
That's great

445
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,711
But Jose made were thinking around $400

446
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,759
$100

447
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
No contest

448
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
On the number

449
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
But you know what Mitch did remember who the socks

450
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Complain that night

451
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
And post it was just one other thing

452
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,231
Standing in the back of the stadium in

453
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:48,607
All of a sudden I look down I saw the whole stadium I saw all the players all the

454
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
Stanza

455
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
It was just

456
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
And how long does that feeling last

457
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
It lasted about

458
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,871
Two or three seconds and then I I got back to work

459
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
