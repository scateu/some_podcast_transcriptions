Who happened to like tennis balls

Any something under the couch

32
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,464
It was like a bumper

33
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,512
He rolled the ball towards the couch

34
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,304
And it didn't go under

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,608
When the ball row rolled

36
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
For the couch

37
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656

00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,704

Moret servicenow.com

99
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:01,152
Hibernate you've been reporting on world patent marketing for a while now right is this the craziest or you've ever worked

100
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,088
Pretty crazy but I've also written about you know cough syrup theft rings for purple drank

101
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,392
That's possibly involved Lil Wayne and

102
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:16,512
Chris Brown as customers so that was crazy too

103
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
Where does the story go down

104
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Festive cats

105
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,863
A confidentiality agreement

106
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
He signs it he send it back in

107
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,727
Then he hears from a representative of world patent

108
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
If it's British guy who the New York

109
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
And you like wild

110
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
Fantastic

111
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,663
What a great idea really talking it up

112
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,015
And then the guy said the next step was that world patent marketing could do some research

113
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,879
He told me that for the price of 1995

114
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
They will be able to do an analysis

115
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,791
So Steve is told that the market analysis is going to tell him

116
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,119
Whether there any other products out there like his

117
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
And if so are they patented

118
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,495
It also is going to tell him

119
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
How marketable his product is

120
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,383
And how World patent marketing could Market it for him

121
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,735
And then it's six weeks I would get a pack a bag and it would tell me everything

122
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
Oh my God

123
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,183

128
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
Like $20

129
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
No

130
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
Are you talkin $1,995 but

131
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
But as an investment

132
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
In your future

133
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:41,503
You know you got to be in it to win it and so that's what I did I went in at 2 with it

134
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271

135
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,111
Perceive gave the company has credit card information

136
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,903

From World patent marketing

143
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
Opened up the envelope

144
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,079
And there was a packet in there probably around

145
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:11,199
I would say 50 pages is a very very first who's sick it was very thick

146
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
It was very impressive

147
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Inequalities

148
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527

00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,583
There is nothing else like it that was patented Repose ballie bumpers

154
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
Like a viable product

155
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
Yes it was so

156
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,471
There was a section that gave you a score

157
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
My score was

158
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
80

159
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
Which was the top

160
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,895
79 to a hundred was a probable

161
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,943
High probable sale toolbox

162
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,783

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
Walmart all of them

166
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
I mean

167
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,719
The dream right then

168
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,255
In their became a reality

169
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
Also in the packet

170
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
4 steps on what he could do next

171
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
The Rock

172
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,423
Packages that world patent marketing offer

173
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,239
And Steve was pretty excited at the time

174
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
Started looking into the primo one

175
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
It was a universal patent

176
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Protection package

177
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,455
I want that. This package

178
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,015
Are patents mentioned in 21 countries

179
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
Manufacturer

180
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
I never do all the marketing

181
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Product

182
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
That was

183
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,975
$20,000

184
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
So that was

185
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
One of several options

186
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
Yeah and there are other options

187
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,887
2 but I figured that

188
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,703
Because my score came in as high as it did

189
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
I would want to protect myself

190
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,847
In other countries if you didn't want people ripping you off

191
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
Another country exactly

192
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,967
He went ahead and put a New York to meet with his financial advisor

193
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,015
To talk to him about this package

194
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
And his financial advisor

195
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Thought the

196
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,879
Packet was legit and

197
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
They decided to go for it

198
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,487
Patent application paperwork for his patent

199
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,327
He was told that his product needed to be patent pending before he can move forward

200
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
Steve

201
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:09,471
Who is full of Creative Energy and like nervous because he wanted to get started on this

202
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,287
Couldn't go out and talk to manufacturers or Market

203
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Did the Peter topping and

204
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,175
You know you're looking around and thinking old man old man

205
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
Got to come through it's got to come through

206
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
And

207
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Sure enough

208
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
It it did

209
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
It did

210
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
Oh yeah I did get a

211
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
Is the receipt

212
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
That it had actually been filed

213
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:37,887
Okay and that all the paperwork was received by the US patent office and then my product was in Patton

214
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
Pending status

215
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
Perceive

216
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
This is huge

217
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
I was in a better I was

218
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
I was that person

219
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,639
Like the person who invented the the steel mills and

220
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
The only other

221
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,223
Crazy things that were invented

222
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
I was now part of that family and

223
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,903
You know it was just a thought of of being an Avenger that made me feel so wonderful

224
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
So after that

225
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
Steve hears

226
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
From the CEO

227
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,583
A world patent marketing himself a guy named Scott

228
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
He was definitely

229
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
A New Yorker someone who

230
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,055
I'm not taking anything away from New York all night

231
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,871
So was so was this guy SKy Cooper

232
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
Was he stoked about your products

233
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
He told me

234
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,527
He told me that this was going to be

235
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
The product

236
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
His company

237
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,391
He was going to I was going to be

238
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,207
Did the top inventor of

239
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Roll patent

240
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Well

241
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Oh yeah

242
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
Oh oh oh yeah oh oh

243
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
It gets it gets a whole lot better

244
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,007
We should stay here we did try contacting Scott Cooper

245
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
Where to get his side of this

246
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
I didn't get back to

247
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,895
So Steve is pretty excited to be working with World patent marketing at this point

248
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
But things are going a little slow for amino

249
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,015
He's like I want to be in every Walmart yesterday

250
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,367
So he doesn't even wait for World patent marketing to find a manufacturer

251
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
He finds one for himself

252
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
And

253
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
We were go

254
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
Scott

255
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,303
Scott and World patent marketing we're not upset

256
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
That you

257
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,119
Dad found your own person

258
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
Oh no

259
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
Oh no

260
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
It was the opposite

261
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
Cooper call them up and it's like

262
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
We need to do a market

263
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,151
What's we got to send out a press release across the country

264
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
Any sense of a draft of the release

265
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,015
I said Scott isn't the only thing is it says that

266
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
World patent marketing

267
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,647
Got me the manufacturer his ball doesn't really say that

268
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,463
It says that you don't we're sort of in on it

269
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Acid

270
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
Got my manufacturers this was all worried about that

271
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
We want to get people motivated

272
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
And I said well

273
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
Okay his trust me

274
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Trust me

275
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,687
So it's a few days later Steve is at a Christmas party in California he's standing by the pool

276
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Scott Cooper

277
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
Inside it is depressed for

278
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:06,111
Saying that Steve Harris just received this incredible Christmas present

279
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Of

280
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
A manufacturer

281
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
And so it went everywhere and I'm fact now I can go everywhere but it also went on his

282
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Website

283
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Haha

284
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
So you were like

285
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
You are a big success story

286
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Actually

287
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
So I was

288
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
The success story that they did

289
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Wait what

290
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
Thousands people

291
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,927
We meet someone who took the bait

292
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:47,327
She and Steve would end up taking this whole thing down

293
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943

More information is available at aecf. Org

299
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:22,911
Okay we're going to pause Steve Harris's story for a second because we need to meet Crystal Carl

300
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
Britney tells about Chris

301
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,751
Crystal Carlson is

302
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Amazing

303
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,615
Investigators she knows her way around public records she knows how to pull

304
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:38,015
Court documents she for many years had her own Plumbing business and I also homes

305
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
School

306
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
My children have seven kids

307
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:46,463
So that's like a full-time job and its own Crystal got involved with World patent marketing after Steve

308
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
She's living in Arizona

309
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:52,863
At the time she would see these reports on the local news about people leaving their kids

310
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
In hot cars

311
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
So she was worried about that

312
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
Casino seven kids

313
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
Crystal went from

314
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:04,383
Civilian to inventor one day when she was coming home from the grocery store with her family as we're bringing groceries in I've got to

315
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,967
Do that have to go potty and I'm trying to get down to the toilet and then the dog

316
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,807
Made an accident so that it's like this clean

317
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:16,671
And then I'm like asking my husband is everything out of the vehicle and he's just staring at me

318
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
I was like

319
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,535
Where's the baby

320
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
So Crystal invented

321
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:30,239
Pressure sensor that detected with a kid was still in the car or any other parent when they were walking away with the child still

322
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Did you like

323
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
Work up a prototype

324
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
I did

325
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
What it look like

326
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
Horrible

327
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
I tore apart a bunch of items

328
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Estelle

329
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
It was not very

330
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
It was like a real

331
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,647
American tinkerer invention

332
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,463
Yes Crystal knew she needed patent protection

333
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
So she went looking for someone to help her

334
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,815
And remember she really does her homework

335
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
I'm a very

336
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,143
Big research nutso

337
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,543
Haha I really poured into it and I found so many different companies and they had all these different

338
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Things that they

339
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,223
Said that they didn't and when you try to research on them you couldn't even find any of their products out there so

340
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,527
It's really hard for me to feel

341
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,599
Like I could trust them she found this one

342
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
World patent marketing

343
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
It was super profession

344
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
The CEO of the company

345
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,791
Was supposed to be very involved with inventors and Crystal like that

346
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
And also

347
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
They had some success stories

348
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:33,215
Hi my name is Steve Harris

349
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,055
And so I decided I'm going to Google search

350
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
Kiss products

351
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:44,735
And lo and behold I came across his product manufacturer for sale in a website

352
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Site

353
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,831
And every other company I can't find it

354
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
Single invention cell

355
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
That's promising

356
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
The world patent marketing

357
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255

So crystals looking around and she finds this page

359
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,655
On the world patent marketing website touting its advisor

360
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,311
They just have this little thing that said meet our Advisory Board and they had all these images to the people who were on The Advisory Board

361
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
Impressive

362
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,199
Impressive because a lot of those people

363
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Tide

364
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
Background

365
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
To them

366
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,623
That would make you feel that they were important

367
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,671
Government officials

368
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,743

376
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,831
Whitaker was paid for his role on The Advisory Board close to $10,000

377
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
According to court.

378
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,695
Give us a list of prominently and press releases about the company

379
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
Any recorded videos for them

380
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,839
There's one that we saw online where he's talking up this chair for a hot tub

381
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,143
It's a unique design is going to help

382
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
Lots of people

383
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Manor

384
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,383
And here's another one of him describing dislike razor blade cover

385
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Is a

386
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
Simple design but unique

387
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:25,855
We did reach out to the Attorney General's office and a spokesman told us that Matthew Whitaker

388
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,183
Had no knowledge of any fraud happening at World patent marketing

389
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:35,839
Roccat marketing is just the latest version in a long-running cotton that has been

390
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
Take advantage of inventors for

391
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
Decades now

392
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
But World patent marketing is unique

393
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
Because of how much money was able to get out of

394
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
People like

395
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
Crystal

396
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
World patent marketing

397
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
Mostly the same cell on crystal as they did to Steve

398
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,479
The confidentiality agreement and whatever

399
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
But there were a couple nutria

400
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
This time

401
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
They made her wait before they took her money

402
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
And I told her it's because I had another lady

403
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,671
What an idea just like hers

404
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:05,535
But you were more prepared than she was so they ultimately decided to move forward with you

405
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Wow

406
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
Now I have this feeling of

407
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
Oh my goodness

408
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
There's another person out there

409
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
Trying to move forward

410
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
What the same thing as me

411
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,335
I'm in a race moving right right

412
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,127
Crystal's sold in old cars

413
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Scrubs together

414
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,199
Some change and paid for the marketing study

415
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,991
And again it found

416
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,527
Her products was a winner

417
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,623
World patent marketing told her that she needed to pull together 36

418
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Thousand dollars

419
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
For the global patent protection

420
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
This package

421
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Was the work

422
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,399
They said it would get her patent protection everywhere it would get her copyrights trademarks

423
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Ana license

424
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,775
They told her that to raise the money she could just go borrow from friends and family

425
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,591
Or maybe she can take out a second mortgage on her house

426
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,991
Or go get a personal loan I don't even know a person personally who could go out there and get a personal bank loan

427
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,295
$35,000 cash

428
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Right

429
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
So

430
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,975
I can't do that so she turned and said to her friends and family

431
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
And she showed them

432
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:13,375
The packet that she had received from World patent marketing about the viability of her product

433
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,983
Crystal told her friends and family what her contact at World patent marketing told her

434
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
That

435
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
They would make their money back in 6

436
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
So

437
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,383
Her friends and family gave her the money

438
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
Incent World patent marketing

439
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
36

440
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
$1,000

441
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
Kriti sanon today

442
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,295
Crystal realized

443
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Hennessy

444
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
A patent attorney kept making errors

445
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:39,743
She was having to correct them this is the part of the story where the dogmas of the inventor

446
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
Combines with suspicion

447
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
And becomes a powerful tool

448
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,399
Crystal start researching everything chic

449
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,959
Patent law licensing marketing

450
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
And she starts

451
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
Calling World patent marketing

452
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,335
Pretending like she doesn't know about these things

453
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
And drilling them

454
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,175
And won't they're stopped all the phone calls

455
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,015
Savannah Crystal started looking for other world patent marketing customers

456
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
To see if they were having similar issue

457
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,599
How'd you do that

458
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,623
Facebook

459
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,671
I mean I know it sounds crazy but

460
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,743
The first reason that Crystal tries to find

461
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
Is that guy from the videos

462
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,839
That's the guy whose product World patent marketing was bragging about

463
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,631
Again

464
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
On your knees or

465
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
Straining your back looking under the couch or bed for your pets toys or the remote control had to find him

466
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
And the way that she did was

467
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,895
Pretty clever and every single

468
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,735
Article they wrote it was Steve H you know so

469
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
Steve wise

470
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
Ddave so

471
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
I went through

472
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,951
All the way like 2 years back and then I found

473
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:48,607
This poly bumpers thing they were promoting and then I click to view who all likes it and I see this

474
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,703
Steve Harrison oh my God the Steve H cuz I was not the only one that was

475
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,103
Steve with hearing a lot from other people who are sending him messages

476
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,919
If I was a multi-millionaire

477
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:08,575
How do I get into the box stores really busy trying to get his products

478
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,951
Into stores he had had 500 Vale bumpers manufactured

479
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
With the manufacturer that he himself found

480
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,303
I need marketing the product on its own

481
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,119
Air inflation pump free

482
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,679
Order Chinese boy poppers today

483
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
Your dog

484
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Never lose

485
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
His balls again

486
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,847
To Crystal messaged him it was like

487
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
How's your project going

488
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,455
And we start exchanging stories to realize that

489
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
We were being scammed

490
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
And then

491
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,807
Steve received a letter

492
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
From the US Patent off

493
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
And

494
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,671
I open the envelope

495
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
I

496
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
Pretty much hit the floor

497
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,119
Because the letter can

498
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,167
Contain information that my patent

499
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
When abandon

500
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,519
World patent marketing hadn't submitted his patent application

501
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
Improperly

502
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,615
And then when the patent office followed up with questions they hadn't responded

503
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:08,223
Steve dreams of being an inventor and His image of himself as an inventor

504
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,575
Was all coming crashing down around him one of the sons of the manufacturers

505
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,367
Texted me at

506
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,928
3 in the morning and woke me up

507
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,232
And said you better see this

508
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
And it was a commercial for

509
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
Product

510
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,608
That was just like mine

511
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,144
That was published

512
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
Five years prior

513
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
So

514
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
The Prado

515
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
So

516
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,592
It was

517
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
It was devastation

518
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
It was complete devastation

519
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
So you'd spend

520
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
3 years of your life

521
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
Roughly $110,000

522
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
Have you sold any

523
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,672
Read sold

524
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Probably about

525
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
30 of them

526
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
And then

527
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
You haven't sold one since

528
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,632
I can't I be infringing on someone else's patent

529
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
How does that feel

530
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,920
I I I I can't

531
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
I can't go I can't go there

532
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
That that's a place I can't go

533
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,600
Meanwhile Crystal was reaching out

534
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,904
To everyone she could trying to warn them off

535
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
One of her biggest moments

536
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,232
Was when she found out about a police officer

537
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,840
Put already sent money with World patent marketing and was planning to spend thousands more

538
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
She called him and I told him what happened to me

539
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
And I told him what happened to Steve

540
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,032
At that point he said thank you

541
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,848
How did you feel right then

542
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Really good

543
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
Yeah

544
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
You should feel good about that

545
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,576
I'm sorry I'm getting teary-eyed

546
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
It's fine

547
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,768
Personal experience

548
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:01,120
You know I borrow $236,000 from friends and family

549
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,240
It makes you feel horrible

550
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,568
When you're able you're not able

551
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,592
To give it back

552
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
I'm sorry

553
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,504
I haven't talked about it like

554
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,296
While

555
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,416
Did you ask them for your money back

556
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
I did

557
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
I did

558
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,328
I sent a certified letter

559
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,912
Crystal Palace. Cooper give me my money back or I'm going to report you to that

560
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,960
Immediately she got an email back

561
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,496
He threatened me

562
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,616
That he was not doing these things that I claimed he was doing and

563
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
She's got all these

564
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:51,552
Powerful people part of the Obama Administration on his Advisory Board and why would any of

565
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
Of these people

566
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,392
Want anything to do with him

567
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:01,024
If he was doing the things that I claimed Crystal shut her computer and decided okay

568
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
We're doing this

569
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Call the FDA

570
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
Call patent office

571
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:13,056
Started trying to reach out to anybody else I could and man we grew our numbers fast that's when we went

572
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,360
From 10 to 20 to 50 to 100

573
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,736
So this letter to him happened in April and by December we are filing a class-action lawsuit

574
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
By August

575
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,832
I was already talking to the FTC

576
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,624
In private

577
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,440
Because they were doing a soft investigation

578
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:36,352
So in 2017 the FTC comes in and they raid the offices of world time

579
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Marketing

580
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,936
They got all the paperwork and the office

581
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,752
And they file a complaint accusing

582
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,848
Scott Cooper and World patent marketing of building thousands of people out of

583
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
Almost 26 million dollars

584
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,944
We reached out to that DC and they decline

585
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,504
But there were tons of documents

586
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
They submitted in court

587
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,088
And a lot of crazy stuff came out

588
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,880
The CEO Scott Cooper

589
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,464
At former Israeli military as security guards

590
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,560
You tell people they were trained in Krav Maga and use them to threaten

591
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Another thing that came out where the script

592
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:13,984
Scripps that sales representatives would use when they were trying to persuade somebody to send them money

593
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,056
A lot of pictures of felt like their ideas are unusual

594
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
And being approved

595
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,128
But it turned out that they're all working off of us

596
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,688
Stetson Baptist he found no rejection

597
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:27,552
One more thing that came out in court was an email from Matthew G Whitaker

598
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
The now acting a

599
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Attorney General

600
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,672
He was put in place last week after Jess session

601
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Chance was fired

602
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:38,048
This email seems like it's a someone who's complaining about world patent marketing

603
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,864
It basically was telling this person

604
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,656
That they could face

605
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:46,240
Potential civil or criminal consequences

606
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,544
If they were doing

607
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,592
What sounded like from you know the context

608
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
The email

609
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,408
Reporting to

610
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,200
Better Business Bureau or

611
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Marrying

612
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,504
The company online

613
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,296
We asked Chris about this

614
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
How do you feel about this

615
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,696
This guy who's now one of the most powerful people in America

616
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,744
Being involved with this company

617
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,352
My personal opinion is I do not know Mr

618
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,144
Whitaker personally

619
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,472
But as far as any involvement with World patent marketing

620
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,264
World patent marketing with

621
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,360
Stock Supra with a con man and he conned

622
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
Everyone

623
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
Focus on Steve

624
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
That if they can fall for it

625
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
So could anyone

626
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
Including a former US attorney

627
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:35,648
I called the court-appointed receiver this morning the guy who's trying to collect money for the

628
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,208
And he told me while other board members ever

00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488

630
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
