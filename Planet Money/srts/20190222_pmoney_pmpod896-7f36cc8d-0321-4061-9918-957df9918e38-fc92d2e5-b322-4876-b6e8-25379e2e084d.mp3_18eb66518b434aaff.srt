1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,328
Today show with part 3 of what I have been

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:05,376
Been calling me Planet Money antitrust

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,168
The show will be much better if you

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:07,936
You go back and listen

5
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,216
The first two episodes

6
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,496
If you do not

7
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,520
Here is the

8
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,568
Text that Scrolls on the screen at

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,016
United States government used to use antitrust law a lot

10
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,600
To protect small companies against big companies in the name of competition

11
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
Then there was a back

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,672
Flash led by a judge named Robert

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,976
He wrote a book called The antitrust parody

14
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,792
Docks that argued antitrust enforcement had gotten out of hand

15
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,584
And the government needed tobacco

16
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:40,192
Now in the past couple years as a few tech companies have gotten very big

17
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,472
And very powerful

18
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,520
A backlash to the backlash has been

19
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:50,176
My name is Lina Khan and I'm an academic fellow a Columbia Law School and a senior fellow at the open market

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,224
Find your lawyer

21
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,552
I'm a lawyer when Lina Khan was in law school 2 years ago

22
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
She wrote a paper for the lottery

23
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,136
What was the title of the

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
Amazon's antitrust paradox

25
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,976
An allusion to that board

26
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,768
The antitrust paradox

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,048
Why did you choose that

28
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,120
I was interested in exploring how

29
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,448
Works approach to antitrust had enabled Amazon's rise

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
And

31
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,056
The Paradox with Amazon seems to me that

32
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
Here we had a company that was amassing dominance in various markets but our current approach to antitrust laws

33
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
Always really keeping us blinds

34
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
So that dominance

35
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,136
And so that to me seems like an interesting tension or current approach to Aunt

36
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
Worksop Road

37
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,720
Is known as consumer welfare

38
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
The basic idea is

39
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,280
Low prices

40
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,560
And lots of choices

41
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Are good

42
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,424
If consumers are getting these things then there's no antitrust problem

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
End

44
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,592
Clearly Amazon has delivered low prices and lots of choices so it hasn't run into much trouble with an

45
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
Antitrust law in the United States

46
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,480
And yet Mina Khan argued in this paper there are things that Amazon has

47
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
I've been that

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,832
So her wonky article comes out

49
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,880
She heard from a few antitrust lawyers

50
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,952
Ben-Hur article gets mentioned in the New York Times

51
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,024
That's bird kind of a new wave of interest and so I just

52
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,608
Started receiving more and more email

53
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
What about this which I

54
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
Respect

55
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
The tremendous amount

56
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,008
Even though it's not good for our story

57
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
What she is not saying

58
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,872
Is the Des student law review article

59
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,152
Completely blew up

60
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,712
I mean I know you didn't go on Ellen

61
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,112
Or whatever

62
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,928
Lina Khan learned that the rise of a few Giant

63
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
Had made this very wonky thing

64
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
Antitrust

65
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,584
Suddenly feel urgent and important

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
Two lots of Ordinary People

67
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Is it

68
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,704
Bad these companies are so big r

69
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,776
They assigned that the free market is failing us

70
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,312
And competition is this

71
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,896
Disappearing do we need to think about antitrust in a new

72
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,808
Congressman wanted to meet with her The Washington Post in the Atlantic wanted to profiler CNBC NPR

73
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,136
She joins me now to talk about how antitrust law

74
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
Handles Amazon

75
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
Lena thank you for being with us let me first say Amazon is among NPR's core

76
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
Corporate sponsors

77
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,448
Right we're going to have to talk about that hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob

78
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,520
I'm Kenny Malone today on the show Amazon

79
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
One of our corporate sponsor

80
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,592
And Facebook

81
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
And Google

82
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
Spectra corporate Swanson

83
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
Okay but all of this is kind of a

84
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
These three companies are suddenly everywhere

85
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,344
They have an incredible amount of money

86
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
Empower

87
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,952
And leave his part of this new wave of thinkers were starting to say

88
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:46,816
Maybe the rise of these giant tech companies is a sign that antitrust is broken

89
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,840
And we need to fix it

104

So the question for Today Show is

105
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,607
What if anything should we do about the big toe

106
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,471
I mean actually that's a ridiculously large question there's no way we could do that

107
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
And we're going to do a subset of that

108
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
Question right we're going to focus specifically

109
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
On competition and the free market and the role of the gutter

110
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
We're going to focus on anti

111
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Took the question really is

112
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:41,087
Should we be using antitrust law in some way with respect to these big Petco

113
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
And the way we're going to do this

114
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,927
We're going to talk to two very smart

115
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
Lawyers who

116
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Job is

117
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
To answer questions like

118
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,583
We're going to ask them to Big Quest

119
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
1

120
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
Are we thinking about antitrust

121
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
The right way

122
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,007
Does this consumer welfare standard still

123
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
10 question 2

124
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,383
If you had all the antitrust power in the world

125
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
What would you do

126
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
First step

127
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Lina Khan

128
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
Do you want a title we're going to make you that

129
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
Ruler of antitrust in America

130
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
Nazi scientists article to the

131
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,671
Spirit of antitrust

132
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
So you where are you

133
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,023
Assertive respectfully decline an appointment

134
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,095
I'm happy to play along with the hive

135
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,703
Is there a reason in particular to focus on big technology

136
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,567
So the reason I've been focusing on big technology companies is because I think

137
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,127
Some of the blind spots of the car an antique

138
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Best approach

139
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,479
Are most significant in the context of these tech companies

140
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:47,135
In part because in many instances are offering products or services that are nominally free or paying and data

141
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
So that complicates how antitrust

142
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
Starbucks at these issues

143
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
Think of Google and Facebook

144
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,047
You don't have to pay money to use those services

145
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
So the current antitrust

146
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
Consumer welfare standard

147
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
Which focuses largely on price

148
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
Just isn't going to work very well

149
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,311
Also she says this is fundamental nature of a few key text

150
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
They just tend to be winner-take-all

151
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,711
Everybody's going to tend to end up using one search engine one social network

152
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,783
Everybody who wants to buy or sell online

153
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,879
Is going to wind up at the one online store with the most buyers in

154
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,439
Can we talk about specific companies

155
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Okay

156
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,767
What should we do about Amazon

157
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:31,679
I think first we need to have investigations into Amazon's conduct we have a very

158
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,983
Meagre understanding of how the different parts of

159
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:40,383
If it's business is actually Interlink and how it potentially uses data collected in World Market to Advantage itself in another Market in

160
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
And that sort of thing

161
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,503
And so I think as a first step more investigations more hearing

162
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:50,879
I'm just understand what's happening and that should then help inform what we should do

163
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
Okay what about as a second

164
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,351
Realizing things that are way more interesting frankly than investigation

165
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
Yeah I mean I think

166
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,471
It'll one problem that I've been focused on is the potential

167
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Conflict of interest

168
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
It seems baked into some of these companies current

169
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,639
Businesses Amazon

170
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
Amazon is many

171
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,735
The main thing most people think of when they

172
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
I think of Amazon is

173
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
This Market

174
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,111
A store where anybody who wants to can

175
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
Sell almost anything they want

176
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
The millions and millions of potential

177
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,279
In the jargon this Marketplace is

178
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
A platform

179
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
And what we wound up mostly talking to Lina Khan about

180
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,679
Is what does it mean for competition when

181
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,495
One company wind-up controlling such a

182
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
A huge

183
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,079
I mean what so unique about platforms is that

184
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:47,711
Platforms end up dramatically reducing the cost of entry for all the third parties and what that means is

185
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
Platforms can be really

186
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,527
Good for competition

187
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,391
Because now there's this place where everybody in America who wants to buy say

188
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Batteries

189
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
This is going to go to buy there

190
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,279
So if I want to get into the battery selling business that is great

191
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
Of course I have to compete against

192
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
All the other battery brands

193
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:12,287
Not only Duracell and Energizer but also Amazon's own private label batteries

194
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
Amazonbasics batteries

195
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
Amazon

196
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
As built out pretty extensive private label it has at least a hundred and twenty different labels where it's now actually Pro

197
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
Producing Amazon based

198
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Good

199
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
You could argue

200
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
A lot of people do

201
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,183
But these Amazon store brands are good for combat

202
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
Amazon is one more competitor in the market

203
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,815
Pecan argues in the long run

204
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,911
Amazon selling Amazon brand stuff on Amazon

205
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
Maybe bad for company

206
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,103
So that I think can create a conflict of interest and so far is Amazon owns the platform it runs the platform and decide

207
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,663
I2 comes up where in the search rankings

208
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,759
But it's also competing with all the merchants that are now depending on the platform

209
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,319
So this problem I mean this seems like

210
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,879
A fundamental like a store brand problem

211
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Bright light therapy

212
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,767
You know whatever Walmart is a bigger retailer than Amazon and they have store brands and they can you know

213
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,047
Put

214
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
Purina dog food on the bottom shelf in the

215
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,263
Boy or whatever their house dog food is on the top shelf and you could imagine the same problem they're right a giant retailer with all this

216
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,847
Power just said so look what we're going to have a store brand

217
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
Is that a similar competitive Prof

218
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
I think you have to really look

219
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
At the degree to which

220
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,367
The retailer or the distributor is

221
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
Playing a bottleneck roll

222
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
In a sector

223
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
So which retailer is a

224
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
It's absolutely true that they have private labels generally speaking there's much more competition and the retail Industries and there is

225
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
Prison online Commerce

226
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,007
And so I think that means that the stakes of discrimination are quite different

227
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,103
So you're saying I could shop at Walmart or I can shop at Kroger I could shop at cost

228
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,431
That level of competition that you're talking about

229
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,247
There's also the issue of how a risk gets assigned

230
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
The issue of who is taking

231
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
The riskier

232
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,879
The company developing a new product

233
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Or

234
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,231
The company running the store where the product is going to be so

235
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
So what's a Jacob

236
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
That

237
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
You and I decide to go into

238
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
I'm going to sell

239
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
Hats for dog yes

240
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
Million-dollar idea

241
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
The way a lot of traditional stores

242
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
They buy the dog hats

243
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
From us in bulk

244
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,895
And then if the dog had sit on the shelves and don't sell

245
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,455
It's not really our problem at least not in the short

246
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
The retail store

247
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
Paid us money

248
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,575
For our hats we have the money

249
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
The store took the risk

250
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
That the hats my

251
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
Amazon does not work

252
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
Amazon is not going to buy the dog hat

253
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,559
That's from us we can post or dog hats

254
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
For sale on him

255
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
And if they don't sell

256
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
We go out of business

257
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
And it did not cost Amazon in

258
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
If the dog had to do self

259
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
Then we pay Amazon jungle Barbara

260
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
Dog hat sell like crazy

261
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,663
If the world suddenly Goes Bananas for dog hair

262
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,503
Then Amazon is free to start selling their own line

263
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
Amazonbasics

264
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
Is the bring all sorts of nice

265
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
Cut up shirt that are not guaranteed

266
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
Need to sell their

267
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,767
It's the third parties that are undertaking the original

268
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
Risk

269
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,607
To invest in a product and see hey is this going to succeed

270
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
What's troubling is that in some instances

271
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
When a product does start doing well

272
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,591
Amazon observes it and then takes that idea produces it itself

273
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:31,199
Knocks out the third party from the top search listings and so suddenly you know

274
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
Is Amazon that's reaping the rewards

275
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
Of the risks that somebody else took

276
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,111
Then what would you expect this sort of long-term consequence would be

277
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:43,231
I need the long-term consequence will be the third parties will be more reluctant to invest

278
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:49,631
Skin products to take risks to bring them to market the idea being that even if this product succeeds there's a

279
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,447
A good chance that Amazon will appropriate the value

280
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
Of that reward

281
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:59,615
And they'll just be left hanging other words if Amazon's just going to wait and see if our dog hats cell

282
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,967
And if they do sell it's going to start selling amazonbasics dog hat

283
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,295
Why should we get into the dog had business in the first place

284
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
Kant argues that lots of people will think

285
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,183
Why should I even start selling anything online

286
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
I'm just going to end up losing to Amazon

287
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
And in the long run she says

288
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
This will mean less,

289
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,655
You presented this as a problem or is a potential problem

290
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
What's the solution

291
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
I think one solution is

292
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
Separating the marketplace

293
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,103
From Amazon private label I think

294
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,663
If you're going to be a dominant Marketplace

295
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Then

296
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,015
You perhaps you to be able to also sell on that Marketplace

297
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,343
Putting yourself in direct competition with all the merchants that art

298
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,903
Dependent relationship of dependents

299
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,719
It really want to drive home here

300
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,791
It is that you would say to Amazon

301
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,839
You can either sell Amazon stuff

302
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,423
Or you can be a Marketplace for all these third-party sellers

303
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
But you are not allowed to do

304
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
That's right

305
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
That's that's a big one

306
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:06,943
It's a big one not just because it would mean the government intervening in a big way in this giant pizza

307
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,735
Although obviously that is big

308
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,879
It's a big one because really we haven't seen antitrust enforcement on this scale in this country

309
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
For decades

310
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,951
And by the way we did reach out to Amazon

311
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Spokesperson argued

312
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
Amazon making its own product

313
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,095
Means lower prices better product and more

314
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
He also noted that private label

315
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,959
Is a relatively tiny part of Amazon

316
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
After the break

317
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
We talked to her second emperor

318
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
And he tells us what he would do

319
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847

The second person we're going to talk to

333
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
To today is Scott here

334
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
He's an NYU Law professor

335
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,407
He's teaching right now and antitrust course called

336
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
Big Tech and standard oil

337
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
Perfect for the series

338
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Working on

339
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,087
And he did want us to mention that he's done some Consulting work for a firm

340
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
It has concerns about Ana

341
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,207
Temple is working antitrust for a long time

342
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
And for most of that time

343
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,071
Most people were just not very interested in

344
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
In talking about

345
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
Was there a moment that you

346
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,447
You realize other people were perking up and paying attention

347
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,287
Would have played a role in the last presidential campaign

348
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,847
It was it was a plank in the Democratic platform

349
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
And

350
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
Then-candidate Trump

351
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,479
From time to time raised concerns about

352
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,783
Possible targets for antitrust intervention

353
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,575
Was it like exciting

354
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,391
Sure it was exciting exciting

355
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
So like

356
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,023
What's it like working and you know being an antitrust expert now having the speaker feel that this

357
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
It's cool that people are excited about this

358
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,375
Is there a black bear

359
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,543
We worried that we'll get it wrong that we'll get too excited that will pass a new law that does more harm than good

360
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
That

361
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,127
People have unrealistic expectations for what

362
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
And I trust is about I would accomplish

363
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
Scott Hemphill describes his antitrust views as middle of the road

364
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,087
He doesn't think the system needs to change as much as leadec on things

365
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
The system needs

366
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
You're one difference between the two of us

367
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
Confidence the consumer welfare standard

368
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,511
Just fundamentally can't work any

369
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
Hemphill thinks it can

370
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,631
Remember consumer welfare is a lot about price

371
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,471
But companies like Google and Facebook give their product away to people

372
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
For free

373
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
So it seems like under the consumer welfare state

374
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,359
And it would be really hard to know what to do about

375
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
But

376
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,223
We say consumer welfare and antitrust is a short

377
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
Four situations where sometimes we don't mean

378
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,343
Consumers in the sense of individual

379
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,391
Consumers can also include companies

380
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
Step by step

381
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,231
Like say companies that buy ads on Google and Facebook

382
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,327
And if Google and Facebook use their Market power to jack up and prices

383
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,423
That can be a violation of antitrust law under the consumer welfare standard

384
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,775
Scott Hemphill says generally we are thinking about antitrust in the right way

385
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,335
We don't need to rethink the goal of an

386
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,943
Is still worried about big tech companies

387
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
And competition

388
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
Emperor of anti

389
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
Today

390
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
What would you

391
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
Two major things

392
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
Oh

393
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
1 is

394
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,279
Could I just want to point out as soon as you were annoyed and Emperor you fold your arms in a very

395
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:39,167
Assertive

396
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,239
One place to go is

397
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
2

398
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Investigate

399
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
Now this may seem like small stuff

400
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Of course you want to invest

401
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Pretty weak

402
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,711
I'm I'm warming up here

403
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,271
The main thing I want to do is take a hard look

404
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
At Tech murders that have

405
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
Already been consummated where

406
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,183
There may have been an anti-competitive problem at the

407
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
What's the big idea for

408
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
Scott Hemphill

409
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Mergers

410
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
That is the thing that worries him

411
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
Thinks about big Tech

412
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
And antitrust

413
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
And specifically what are some of those men

414
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
So that the

415
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,007
The one that jumps out to me is

416
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Facebook

417
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Instagram

418
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,103
In 2012 Facebook buttons

419
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,151
Instagram for 1 billion dollars

420
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
And handle says

421
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
Is antitrust emperor

422
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
She would try to figure out

423
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Why Facebook

424
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,343
And why he says is important because

425
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,903
Murderers are not inherently on anti

426
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,743
Is that sometimes there's a totally legit reason for two firms to

427
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,559
The classic reason for murders is if you think

428
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
1 firm

429
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,863
Can

430
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,679
Help successfully grow promote develop

431
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
The technology of the other

432
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:51,103
So Facebook already has all this data and it has a great ad sales team or whatever things that will really benefit in

433
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Instagram is just

434
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
Going to be a more efficient business

435
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,223
Can I grow better that's going to be good forever

436
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
That's a good news happy stories

437
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
And it might be right

438
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
Also you might be wrong

439
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,671
The Facebook Instagram Marjorie might be a bad news

440
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Sad story

441
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
Companies already big

442
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,815
And then it starts getting bigger and bigger

443
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
By buying up other

444
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
That is a sign

445
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,447
But maybe the company is trying to suppress competition

446
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,007
You know what you just buy up its rival so it doesn't have to

447
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
Compete that is obviously

448
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
Bedford company

449
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,639
Temple says as antitrust emperor

450
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,455
He would try to figure out what Facebook was thinking

451
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,759
Why did it want to buy Instagram

452
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
Good news happy story

453
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
Or bad news set story

454
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,415
By the way I just want to bring Lee to come back for like 1

455
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
Second here because

456
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:42,047
She also mentioned the Facebook Instagram merger as a potential antitrust prob

457
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
This really interesting reason

458
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,143
Why it was bad for come

459
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
Let's just think about

460
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,495
Real example of witches

461
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
As Revelations about

462
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
Facebook Slack

463
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
Privacy and security

464
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,871
Protocols of

465
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
I'm coming clear you've heard more people say

466
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,199
I'm quitting Facebook I'm just

467
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Is closing this down

468
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,039
At least I have my Instagram account

469
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
I think

470
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
Privacy is one good example of a

471
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
Dimension on which

472
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,463
Consumers should be able to choose and having more competition

473
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
By that

474
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,839
So this Facebook Instagram merger is one place where Lina Khan and Scott Hemphill

475
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
I'm pretty close on what they think we should do

476
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,703
It what I'm saying is that a transaction

477
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,007
Motivated at the time

478
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
Bye

479
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
Avoidance of competition

480
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,639
Is a good candidate for

481
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Divestiture after the fact

482
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
Wait

483
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Is that

484
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
Middle of the road

485
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:39,903
Consumer welfare is fine antitrust Emperor Scott Hemphill saying

486
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,975
After an investigation depending on the findings

487
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,791
The government should maybe break up

488
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,143
One of the biggest companies in the world that's what I'm that's why I'm thinking about you

489
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Okay

490
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Okay

491
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
OK Google

492
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,543
You're about to not be the emperor anymore you have any last wishes

493
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,847
No no it's

494
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,663
It's a heavy responsibility of the emperor heavy is the head

495
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,735
We did talk to people at Facebook about this whole in

496
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,855
Anime the case that both Facebook and Instagram benefited from them

497
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
They pointed out that

498
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,463
Instagram had infrastructure problems in just about

499
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,767
30 million users when they acquired the cup

500
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,583
6 years later there are 1 billion

501
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
They also noted that

502
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,191
Relevant Regulators so no reason to

503
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
To stop them

504
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,031
So we talked about Amazon with Leena Khan

505
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
In Facebook with Scott

506
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
Hemphill now

507
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
Let's talk about Google purchase

508
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
Google is a big one

509
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,735
We did a whole episode a couple years ago about Google and anti

510
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,807
Still online to find it just Google

511
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
Google is big is that bad

512
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
That was the headline

513
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
Since then there's been more antitrust news

514
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
About Google

515
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
Specifically

516
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:51,583
He's in the European Union that focused on Android on Google's operating system for smartphone

517
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,167
Which is by far the most popular mobile operating system in the world

518
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
Google had told phone maker

519
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
If you want to use Android

520
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,359
You also have to pre install the Google Search app and Google

521
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,895
Chrome browser on your

522
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
The EU looked into

523
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,223
And last year

524
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
Issued a decision

525
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Quote

526
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
Google has use Android as a

527
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Vehicle

528
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
To cement the dominance of its search

529
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
...

530
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,536
They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition

531
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
Any important mobile sphere

532
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,656
The European Union found this illegal

533
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
Under its

534
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,728
Antitrust rules and find Google

535
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
Billion

536
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
Google said in a statement afterwards

537
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,408
Quote Android has created more choice for everyone

538
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Not less

539
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
The company is appealing

540
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,320
So okay we have done these three shows on an ant bite

541
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,648
And the first to wear these historical moments

542
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,952
When we went through really big changes

543
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,000
As a country in the way we think about

544
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:56,096
You know the free market and big business and competition and the role of the governor

545
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,704
And now you know this episode we have that the present moment the rise of the tech Drive

546
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
An end

547
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,776
You know the ending question has to be

548
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:09,152
Is this another moment when we need to once again sort of stop and rethink the way antitrust

549
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Scott hemp

550
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,248
Pretty middle-of-the-road antitrust

551
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
Set no

552
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Maybe we could

553
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
Forced

554
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,672
Current rules better but the rules themselves the worldview

555
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,208
