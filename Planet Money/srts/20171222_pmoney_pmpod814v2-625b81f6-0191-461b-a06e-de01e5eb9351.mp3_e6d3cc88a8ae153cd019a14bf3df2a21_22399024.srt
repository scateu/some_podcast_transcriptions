Many of us myself included

15

We got our start

16
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,304
At the station they were little incubators for a little weird planet money people

After months of scrambling and writing and rewriting and

23
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,576
Reese scrambling

24
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,136

The motion is adopt

29
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,656
President Trump sign that bill today while we are recording this

30
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,472
This is the largest tax overhaul

Index

32
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,032
And when we say large

33
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,944
Not just kidding that was actually Ben bernanke's 600-page macroeconomic

34
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,504
The GOP tax bill

35
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Way longer than

That's right in today on the show we answer the question

46
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
Taxpayers are asked

47
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
For example

48
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384

Orb LLC or MVA or DMV or whatever

00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,368
Entity tax changes mean our moms will stop bothering us about buying property

The big

66
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,072
Headline-grabbing centerpiece of this new GOP tax bill

67
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
Is the cut 2

68
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
Corporate tax rate

69
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
And we're not going to talk about that

70
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,752
Not yet at least we sent Cardiff Garcia out to go deal with that

71
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
He's going to bring us what he found later in the

72
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Episode

73
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
And so to kick things off

74
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
This one's a bit of a doozy

75
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
Pass-through entities

76
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
Which I know

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
I know it sounds more like a

78
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,832
Fake science name for ghosts

79
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,624
But they are very real

80
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
And they are very confusing

81
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
And maybe

82
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
Very lucrative

83
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
To deal with this one

84
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
We brought in

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
2X

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,352
My name is Lily bachelder in the

87
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,144
Professor at NYU School of Law

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
Lily is also the co-author of a reason

89
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
Paper about

90
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,032
The possible loopholes in his new tax bill

91
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,848
That paper has gone surprisingly viral

92
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
We were pretty surprised ourselves

93
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
You are now officially

94
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Tax paper

95
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,832
The rare rare status we also called up Rohit

96
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:43,232
Kumar leader of PWC tax policy Services practice

97
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,768
About this new tax bill

98
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,304
For Price Waterhouse

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
Cooper switch

100
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Apparently

101
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,752
Just goes by PWC now I assume there were some expensive branding exercise that decided that was better

102
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
Sea of accounting firms now

103
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
I suppose yes

104
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,384
We should also say that in a previous life Rohit was a

105
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,688
Policy director for Republican Mitch

106
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
McConnell and Lily also in a previous life

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
With the chief

108
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,112
Tax counsel for Democrats in the senate committee on finance

109
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,184
It is true we talked about Pastor in our we ready to be great

110
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
Okay

111
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
So there's basically

112
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,095
Two kinds of businesses there are what are called C corporation

113
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,191
Which are corporations we're going to talk about those later in the show they're getting attacks

114
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,775
But then there's another way to structure a business

115
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
A pass-through

116
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,871
Apostle the easiest way to think of a past due rent

117
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
Is it is a business

118
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:39,807
But where the income of the business is showing up on the owners individual income tax

119
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,367
So when we think of it as if your

120
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
What's called a folder

121
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
Proprietorship in your

122
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
You know just selling a little bit of crafts

123
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,999
That you make on Etsy

124
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
Maybe you making cell

125
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
Knitted underwear

126
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,863
That is totally a real thing on at

127
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
It would be pretty complicated

128
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,263
And probably too much work or money to set up a whole Corporation

129
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,079
And file a whole separate tax as a corporation

130
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,151
And so we have this other way to structure a business

131
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
That's as a pass-through end

132
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,735
Where the prophets are immediately

133
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,783
Taxed at to the owners

134
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,599
C-cell all of your pairs of underwear as you make

135
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
Whatever profits you get from them

136
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
And then you report that as your income right all of the income rolls up passes through the business to the individual

137
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,839
It shows up on their individual

138
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Income tax return

139
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
Any pastors are not just

140
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Small

141
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,727
Knitted underwear sellers I mean they can be

142
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Giant International

143
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Companies with most

144
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Partners they can be

145
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
Real estate companies like president

146
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,687
Did Trump's real estate company that is made up of a bunch of pastors

147
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
And in all these cases

148
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
Is it works the same way

149
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
The prophets

150
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
Of your business

151
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
Get reported as income

152
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,415
Buy you the owner or owners

153
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
And you pay tax on that income

154
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
Whatever your tax bracket says you sure

155
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
Another new tax bill

156
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
Allows these owners

157
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,143
To not pay tax

158
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,447
On as much as 20%

159
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
Of that pass-through

160
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
20%

161
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
Untaxed

162
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,687
Money part of the rationale is that the new tax bill also has a big tax cut for that other structure

163
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
A business Corporation

164
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
And so it's only fair that

165
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
Both structures

166
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
On the other hand a lot of

167
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623
People feel like this

168
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
Is just another way

169
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,695
To give a tax cut

170
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
To the wealthy

171
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
So if you just looked it

172
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,327
The pass-through businesses that exist right now

173
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,911
Their ownership is really concentrated among the wealthy

174
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,215
So there's some estimates that

175
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:38,591
Over 60% of pass-through business income is earned by the top 1% which is

176
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,943
A lot more than the percentage of wage income that turn by the top 1%

177
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,783
Now it's not like all of those people can take all of that income and simply

178
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
Not pay taxes on

179
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
There is a built-in thrush

180
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
And if you earn more money than that threshold the bill

181
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
Had some language

182
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Is it may restrict

183
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,839
Your deduction you give me one sec I can grab the conference part I've got it on my desk

184
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Great

185
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
Do you hear me

186
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
Okay I found it okay

187
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
So the deductible amount

188
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,775
For each qualified trade or business is the lesser of

189
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Hey

190
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,639
20% of the taxpayers qualified business income with respect to the trailer business

191
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Or

192
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
Be the greater of

193
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
50% of the W-2 wages

194
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
It's very complicated

195
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Language

196
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,343
And it may limit the abuse of this pastor

197
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
But

198
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,439
It does benefit some kinds of businesses over others

199
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Some professions

200
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
Won't be able to take much of a deduction

201
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,863
At all so for example they excluded a whole class of

202
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:38,239
Providers are businesses service providers they call them so doctors lawyers

203
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Accountants

204
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,615
Unfortunately applies specifically to high earning doctors

205
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Employers ni

206
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
But other kinds of

207
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,479
Businesses that own say a lot of assets

208
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
Factories Maybe

209
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Real estate

210
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
They're going to be able to take

211
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
A better today

212
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
Over all these new rules

213
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
Make being a small business or frankly a big one

214
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
A pretty good deal

215
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Maybe

216
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
Even a better deal

217
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
Been being irregular

218
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,423
Human employee says so all of us sitting here at the who are not

219
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,823
Pastor businesses are we just smok sitting here paying more than our fair share

220
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,431
To tell until we get some more clarification on what the bills doing

221
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
And this is the thing about this new tax bill

222
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,087
Came together so quickly and the ink is still drying on the newest version

223
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,647
The even the people who have been watching this thing

224
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
Like Hawks

225
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Are not in

226
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
Hayirli sure

227
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,791
About every line and every word

228
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,095
And how it's ultimately going to be interpreted

229
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Enforced

230
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
So yeah

231
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
There are a lot of

232
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
People myself included who are wondering

233
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
Maybe I should die

234
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
Ask my company to fire me

235
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
Then form an LLC and then

236
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Be rehired

237
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,895
Not as a human

238
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
But as a company

239
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
It may be possible

240
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,295
I'll go that route but then the other one note of caution

241
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,903
I'm other than the general little Caution which is no one should be forming a pass-through entity on the basis of his interview

242
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,791
If the holy artificial Arrangement there's always a risk that the IRS will come back in after the fact insane

243
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,607
Which is the official term

244
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
Is that is that it that's funny

245
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,959
The IRS is of the same term I tell my dog not to eat garbage

246
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,823
Yeah also my daughter when she's about to jump off something she's not supposed to

247
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
There you go

248
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,319
What's the business tax rate their big cuts there a big deal but

249
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Personally speaking

250
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,463
When I sit down in front of TurboTax or at an H&R Block

251
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,279
I will almost certainly not be thinking about

252
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
Business tax

253
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,655
I will pull out a disgusting shoebox full of receipts and

254
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
Realize

255
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
I have no idea to ducks

256
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Directions work the same

257
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
Any answer

258
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,103
Is actually do for now

259
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Because these chains

260
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
I'll kick in

261
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
Until

262
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
You're doing your 2018 taxes

263
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
Is when in fact

264
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
Deductions are changing

265
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
In a big way

266
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
I'm going to hand this one over to Elsa

267
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
All right conduct

268
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,999
These are the things you spend money on during the year that you can take off or

269
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
Did.

270
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
From your tax bill

271
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
You can list

272
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,607
All of these items which is to

273
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Itemized

274
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,727
Deductions or you can just take one standard one size

275
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
It's all d.

276
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,103
Options you get to itemize basically reflect

277
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:29,503
Value judgments by the government meaning when a government lets you deduct certain things got of the government telling you

278
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
How you should spend

279
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
Your money

280
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,367
Like what charity the government wants to encourage charitable

281
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
Contributions show it

282
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Duck that

283
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,511
But this Republican plan has done kind of the opposite with

284
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Expensive homes

285
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
And

286
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Hi tax

287
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
States

288
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,167
What is new Republican plan does is make

289
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471
Those homes a little harder to buy

290
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,543
And a high-tax States a little harder to live in

291
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,639
The mortgage interest deduction has shrunk and the state and local tax deductions

292
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Now have

293
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
All right how are you hear me

294
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
So I called up Howard gleckman a

295
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
The tax policy

296
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Sea center which is not

297
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
Partisan

298
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:09,695
What does the average person do under this new regime opossum

299
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
Deductions

300
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,023
Cancel the important thing to know about this bill is

301
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
There's the kind of no average person

302
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
So you and I can have the same amount of income

303
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,959
But a very different tax

304
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,311
That is especially true if one of us lives in a high

305
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Pax

306
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,871
States because Republicans

307
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,199
Adjust taking a hammer to State and local tax.

308
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
Deductions better known as

309
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Salt

310
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:39,391
They pass the bill that cap salt deduction how many terrible puns are used to talk about deduction

311
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,487
There's lots of there's a lot of them you know take this with a grain of salt

312
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
We don't want to rub salt in the wound

313
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,143
We don't want a text. It's worth its

314
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,959
Quickest weight in salt okay okay okay

315
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:59,871
Because I couldn't resist either just as too much salt can destroy a good dish

316
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,943
There is no such a thing as too much salt in your

317
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Deduction

318
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,575
Alright so one of the Republican plan deductions for property taxes and others

319
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
State and local taxes

320
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
Now cannot exceed

321
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Tencent

322
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
Thousand dollars

323
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,791
Which is really not good for taxpayers who live in high-tech

324
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
And

325
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
Who lives in the high-tech date

326
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,679
The high-tech stagehands Ibiza Blue State

327
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
They tend to be

328
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
States with lots of Democrats

329
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
York

330
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
New Jersey California

331
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,407
That is why there's been such a huge political

332
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Fight

333
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Over-salt

334
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,735
No deduction for state and local taxes

335
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Is have been around since

336
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
The beginning of the income tax

337
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
You know the original idea

338
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
Was very simple

339
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
People should not have to

340
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,463
To pay taxes twice on the same thing

341
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:53,119
What ended up happening is that salt made it a lot easier for states to

342
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
Raising taxes

343
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
And the biggest beneficiaries of salt

344
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,567
Have generally been people who live in Rich suburbs in high-tax States

345
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,175
So there's been this perception that the rich states are getting a break

346
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
At the expense of

347
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Of the rest

348
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Abba country

349
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,295
But Howard says that's actually not true

350
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,879
There is his argument that why should low-tax

351
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,671
State-subsidized Hi-Tech

352
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
And the reality

353
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
Centos high-tech face

354
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,351
Generally contribute more

355
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,631
To the federal government

356
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
Then get back

357
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Federal government

358
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
Which Howard is saying is

359
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,543
Federal assistance benefits lower-income

360
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,151
People and the numbers show that lower-income people tend to live in low-tax States

361
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
High tax states

362
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,223
Don't rely on federal programs at

363
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,575
Anyway people can argue all day about whether or not downsizing salt

364
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,927
Is fair but there is another deduction that Economist have been really

365
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Excited

366
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,279
And that is a mortgage interest

367
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,839
What is so irritating

368
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,143
About this deduction Tuacahn

369
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,727
This is what Economist like to call an upside down

370
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Seduction

371
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
Are we talkin about seduction

372
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,871
Score for mortgage loans of a million dollars

373
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,711
And the in the question is do you really want to subsidize

374
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
People who were buying

375
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Giant houses

376
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Cost a billion dollars

377
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,159
How old is referring to the old rule which let homeowners deduct interest

378
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,719
Payments on $1000000 or less

379
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
Of Mortgage Debt

380
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
Under the new rule now

381
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,607
You can only deduct interest payments on seven hundred

382
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,887
$50,000

383
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
Or less of

384
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,495
The reason a lot of Economist have

385
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,311
Wanted to see less of this mortgage interest deduction

386
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
Is it that they say

387
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
Distorts the economy it

388
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,687
Sabres people with bigger more

389
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
Expensive homes

390
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
People who don't really need help

391
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,087
And maybe the deduction encourages excessive borrowing

392
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
What I really wanted to know is

393
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,463
Can I now tell my parents

394
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
Stop bugging me about buying proper

395
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
So I'm 41 years old

396
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,631
I still have never been a homeowner

397
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
And you know them renting my entire adult life

398
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,799
My parents are convinced that I am doing the dumbest thing in the world

399
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,711
But under this new regime can I go back to my parents and tell them I'm actually not

400
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,759
Being that dumb after all

401
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
Hey what am I really that dumb

402
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,647
So what's going to happen here is your standard deduction is

403
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
Going to go up quite a lot

404
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:30,047
Yeah under the new rules the standard deduction I can take now as an individual has

405
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
GG

406
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
$12,000

407
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
Well the mortgage interest deduction has shrunk so

408
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
How much is a question for me now is

409
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,055
How those two things trade-off and a figure that out

410
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
I have to calculate

411
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,431
Well if I were to buy a house what are the mortgage interest payment deductions that I could

412
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,247
Take and if I were to itemize all my teeth

413
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Options would that

414
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Total

415
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:56,415
Be more than the $12,000 standard deduction I could otherwise take

416
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
And it

417
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
Hideout even under the new rule

418
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,839
It is still a good idea for me to buy

419
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,959
As long as I'm not borrowing more than $750,000 which is

420
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
Definitely

421
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Not

422
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
Company for me

423
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Hi Mom

424
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,895
You're still right

425
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,943

Cardiff Garcia

443
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
Spell less like an odyssey than liked

444
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,287
Okay then hits involve going through a lot of

445
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
Line item

446
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
But it wasn't

447
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
All right

448
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
California

449
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
If this bill were a concert

450
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Corporate tax rate

451
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
Be the headline Act

452
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
Finally arrived

453
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
This is the big one

454
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
Here's the deal

455
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
The corporate tax rate is going down

456
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
35 /

457
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
Percent to 21

458
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
2%

459
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,999
This is a big issue because this taxed

460
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
It's been a good source of revenue for

461
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
For the federal government

462
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,143
Head over 10 years the loss of the government just from this rate cut

463
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,447
Is estimated to be about 1.3

464
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Australian dollar

465
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,799
This may seem like a massive giveaway to corporations

466
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,639
But it's actually something that both Democrats and Republicans have been talking about

467
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
4 years

468
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
I mean I'm a bit skeptical about the

469
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:01,599
Like want to talk somebody who likes it and crawls Smith I'm the director of economic research at the cannon center

470
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,415
Niskanen Center is a kind of moderate neoliberalism

471
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
Think Tank

472
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,511
Carl has some problems with this bill through Raleigh thinks it makes

473
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
They're basically two rationales one is that

474
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,655
The Us corporate tax rate right now is

475
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:20,287
Higher than most of the developed countries in the world

476
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
Base for companies

477
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:27,199
That also means that companies won't have as much incentive to hide their profits overseas

478
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
Clever accounting trick

479
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,039
But I think the larger deal is that

480
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
Encourages like more investment in the United

481
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,159
And so the corporate tax rate is lower

482
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
That makes more investment

483
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
Profitable

484
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,303
And that should cause more investment more jobs and higher incomes are wedges

485
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
People United States

486
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
Let's say we're going to start a corporation

487
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
Planet Money Corporation

488
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Obviously

489
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,215
We get a tax cut

490
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,007
Once we have that tax cut

491
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
Going to have higher profits

492
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,591
We'd have to make some choices about how to

493
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
Spend that new money

494
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
We can invest it we can buy new equipment

495
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
Recorders computers

496
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
We could hire more reporters

497
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Or we could

498
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
The current staff some raises

499
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,647
Orchid lower prices to

500
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
Well I guess blow free because we don't charge

501
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Podcast

502
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,023
Let's face it Planet Money was never going to be a great Corporation

503
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
But anyways

504
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:20,447
The last option the one that you've been hearing a lot of people worried about is that we'd end up giving our shareholders some money back

505
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Stock dividend

506
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
BuyBacks

507
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
The Carlton other advocates

508
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,591
To the bill they think the Investment Park

509
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
Buy new equipment

510
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
Computers for quarters

511
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
They think that that's the most

512
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
Important part of the equation

513
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
It's okay please respond by investing more

514
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
Then that will allow it

515
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
The workers of those companies to be more productive

516
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Lat raises

517
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
Labor productivity

518
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
Which increases the

519
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
Total amount that the economy can produce in a given year

520
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,839
What it means is that investment equipment research and other things

521
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,863
That's what I make

522
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
Planet Money

523
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
Corporation more efficient

524
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
Better and better at cracking a pot

525
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,775
So that's the argument for cutting the corporate tax rate

526
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:00,895
Because you're comes more productive we all get richer plus the US becomes a more competitive places

527
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,479
You business so the Planet Money Corporation stays here and the government keep

528
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Collecting our taxes

529
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
A lot of people are skeptical

530
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
They still worried that companies

531
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,159
Just choose to give the money back to their shareholders

532
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
And here's why

533
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
Companies profits of

534
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,767
Mostly rebounded strongly

535
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Instafinancial price

536
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
So they're going to invest more

537
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
For hire more workers

538
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
Give raises

539
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
They already would have

540
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
Carl doesn't buy that crate

541
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,311
He says it's one thing a lot of big rise in profit

542
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
Is going to just a few

543
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Few companies

544
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,431
The most companies really might use the money to invest

545
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
He also says that even if

546
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,039
The tax cut doesn't compel every company to invest more

547
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
Could still be good for the

548
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
Economy

549
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
Even if a lot of company

550
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
Do just

551
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
Give the money back to their

552
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,975
Usually most investors

553
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
Hit much of

554
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:54,143
The dividends or will they get from BuyBacks and they put it into buying back more stock so it stays in the sense in

555
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
This investment system

556
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
Answer to the extent that happened

557
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,311
The money will find its way towards some new investment to be made

558
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Better words

559
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
A good outcome no matter what they come

560
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,431
All right Carlos Garcia

561
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,271
You're skeptical and and I'm just curious if Carl has convinced you of anything

562
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
She did convince me about this

563
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,367
Specific argument he's making about the

564
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
Corporate tax

565
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
That there's a good chance

566
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
That'll leave

567
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Invest at least

568
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Some of it

569
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,304
Sure okay

570
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,864
That's not quite the end of the story though is it

571
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,424
Because there's something we kind of have to acknowledge about this

572
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Tax rate cut

573
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
Which is that

574
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
Most people are going to bed

575
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Directly from

576
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
The company's benefit Direct

577
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
Play from it they're the ones

578
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
To get higher profit

579
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,176
Most people sort of left of Hope

580
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,480
At the company's then use the money either

581
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,808
Invest more and make the workers better or

582
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
Did they hire more workers

583
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
Are they real

584
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
People salary

585
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,184
Do we need to wait and see who benefits

586
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
From this but

587
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
As you mentioned this is a

588
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
Cost

589
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,304
Leave tax Cut & Sew

590
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
It seems a little bit like a arrestor again

591
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,912
I think some of the most powerful

592
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
Criticisms of this bill

593
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,264
Haven't actually been centered on the fact that it

594
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
It's going to cost the government

595
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
A lot of money

596
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,896
The rather than if it's going to cost the government a lot of money there might have been

597
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,944
Better ways to use that money

598
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
It would have benefited

599
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
Did most Americans

600
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
Another word

601
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,296
There's a lot of people who agree

602
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,856
Did the corporate tax rate at 35% with

603
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
Too high

604
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,952
They just think that there were other ideas it could have had bigger benefit

605
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
It's foremost in mirror

606
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512

The tax bill is 1100 page

610
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,080
