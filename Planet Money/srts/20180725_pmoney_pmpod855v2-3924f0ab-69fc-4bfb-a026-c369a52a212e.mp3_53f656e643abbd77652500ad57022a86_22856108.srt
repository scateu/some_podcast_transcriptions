1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,584
Kipling money we all have our pet obsession

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:04,864
Mine

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,400
Is cartel

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:09,472
I will admit it I am fascinated by

5
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,240
Cartel

6
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,544
When businesses get together and decide

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,312
Not to

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,128
Decide that they are too powerful

9
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,688
And two special for the law of supply and demand

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,992
Like OPEC does for oil

11
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,040
And what I love about cartel

12
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,576
Is it they are set up

13
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
Because of greed

14
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,416
I mean who wouldn't love to charge more for your product

15
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,000
But then someone always gets to go

16
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,536
And starts to cheat

17
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,072
They stab each other in the back

18
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:35,840
Amy

19
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,168
Those thinking about this the life and death of cartels

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,472
When I heard a story from my friend

21
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,824
He works with his group called Innovations for poverty action

22
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,616
You could call it nurse Without Borders

23
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:52,992
Nurse Without Borders it's a nonprofit that helps get Economist to help out with problems in pork

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,344
And just was telling me about this one particular cartel

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,648
The his group had encountered in Senegal

26
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
The poop cartel

27
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,256
Yahoo is this poop cartel that you speak

28
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:09,120
So you've seen in the Way porta potties get serviced

29
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
I'm here when your Porta-Potty is full you've probably seen the trucks that come by with a tanker truck with a big fat

30
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
Here with a big hug and it's the same thing

31
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,200
I like a big porta potty

32
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,224
And

33
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,784
Tickets for, you need to get it cleaned out

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
But it look like

35
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
These trucks were

36
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
Perhaps

37
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,928
Fixing their prices they look like their prices were

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,464
Permanently High

39
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,024
Instead of maybe competitive

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
Parker that you'd expect

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,864
And obviously that put it out of the reach of a lot of people who needed it

42
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
Move over OPEC

43
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,448
Cuz there's price-fixing in Senegalese poop

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
Innovation for poverty action sent a ragtag

45
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,056
A team of Economist to Senegal

46
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,384
Each with their own skills each with a single mission

47
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
Could you create

48
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
A more efficient market

49
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,528
By turning the poop cartel Truckers

50
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,832
Against each other a poop War

51
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
This

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
This I have to see

53
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,816

Employment of Dakar Senegal

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,576
Jokes aside definition is

62
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:37,952
A serious business here in the car if you cannot get rid of the poop and it clean efficient way

63
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,768
Then you are waiting in it during rainy season

64
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,304
Switch industry

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,704
But you can't get rid of the poop without going through this big greedy cartel today on the show Astoria

One day

82
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,952
You don't know when

83
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
You're going to go to the bathroom

84
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Flush the toilet

85
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,816
And it won't go down

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
In Dakar Senegal when this happens

87
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,424
You have a major problem

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,496
Because a large percentage of the house is here use septic

89
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,056
Big concrete line pits Outback

90
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
Contain all the sewage

91
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,152
And when your toilet starts to overflow into car

92
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
It means you're pitiful

93
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,992
And you need someone to remove

94
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
Months worth of crap

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
You need a guide

96
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
Until you have to come

97
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Kia

98
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,464
Autumn apartments in the parking lot behind the Cars

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
National Football State

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,536
It was built for soccer fan

101
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
But instead of bunch of very dirty

102
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
Unwanted businesses

103
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Have set up permanent shop here

104
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,727
Oldest face has been invaded But it belongs

105
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Today

106
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Is the domain of the stadium

107
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
IC

108
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:34,175
People dumping garbage there's car part looks like taxi cabs are getting fixed over here

109
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
In the moment

110
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
Horse-drawn cart

111
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
Calling metal Chuck

112
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
Went over in the corner

113
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
Daddy pig

114
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:49,791
Tanker trucks with tubes on them these

115
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
Are the

116
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
In Senegal they call them monkey dishes

117
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
Toilet suck

118
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,287
These trucks are the single best way to deal with sewage here in Senegal

119
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,847
Because they're quick they're relatively clean

120
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,663
And they bring sewage to a treatment plant

121
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,735
Standing out in front of each truck is a smiling tracker

122
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
Waiting for

123
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,295
Very desperate customers

124
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
To come in

125
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Hello my name is

126
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Chucky

127
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,439
Chucky owns to

128
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
Of these toilets

129
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,023
He's dressed in this Immaculate right

130
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
Green shirt

131
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,119
Maybe because of their particular business

132
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,191
I found practice to be very fastidious about their periods

133
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:32,543
There are a bunch of these truckers standing around the parking lot in front of their big vacchi

134
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,127
They mostly work for themselves and they often sit here

135
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
All day long

136
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Without a custom

137
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
That work

138
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
So in economic terms

139
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
A large Supply

140
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Trucks

141
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
Not that much to man

142
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
She would think o

143
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,439
As a customer I can walk around and negotiate the best price

144
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
But that is not how the system

145
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
Set up

146
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,815
They're all members of an association

147
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
And they want to collectively charge

148
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
As much money as they can

149
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
Chucky says you cannot blame them they have to drive

150
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
All over this huge City

151
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Ndk

152
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
Big and dirty and obvious

153
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
They get stopped by the

154
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
Applejack America

155
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,991
We will talk about bribes they

156
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Glass for bride

157
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
Music

158
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
We cannot escape from the

159
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
What makes

160
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:23,743
This truck is a cartel is it they've agreed to not actively compete with each other

161
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,327
If a customer comes in and one of these truckers gives them a price

162
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,167
Then the customer is not allowed to go from driver to driver

163
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
To get a lower price

164
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Particularly

165
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
Community Management

166
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,431
Yahoo groups

167
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
United

168
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
Pizza it's like a Brotherhood

169
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
A truck driver

170
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,255
OK Google United and they agree on

171
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Australia

172
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
Usually 42

173
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,631
$60 depending on the size of the pit

174
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,983
There's not some internet site you can check to see whether you're getting a good deal or not

175
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,823
Sure there are other parking lot so I just went around the city and you can spend

176
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
Half the day trudging from

177
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
One to another

178
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,455
But they may offer you the same high price

179
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
Truckers perspective

180
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
They may lose a bunch of customers.

181
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
They may sit idle

182
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,159
But as long as they keep the prices high they make more profit

183
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
This would just be up financially

184
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,815
Except for a lot of people in Dakar $50

185
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
Can be a month weight

186
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
They literally

187
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
Cannot pay for it

188
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,471
And so the cartel prices force them to turn

189
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
To another salon

190
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:43,871
It is illegal and it's terrible for the environment but it's extremely common around here

191
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
You can hire

192
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
Some poor sap

193
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
To empty your septic tank by hand

194
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Adam and I went to search for one of these guys

195
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,695
We left the page street with the car and went to one of the small neighbor

196
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
There's dirt lined alleyways

197
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
It gets narrower

198
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
And narrower as you walk

199
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,863
Houses are mostly unfinished

200
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
Cinder blocks

201
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,447
We didn't know if we'd be able to find someone

202
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,799
Who would actually admit to being an illegal pit emptier

203
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
But I don't know I had a brilliant idea

204
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,919
Starts to ask groups of teenage boys

205
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,223
Hannah Montana

206
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:25,343
I know exactly who you're looking for any lupus over to this Courtyard

207
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
They don't miss any

208
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,975
The best reporters

209
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,559
And the best guys the best pictures

210
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
And there

211
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,935
Sitting in the courtyard shade is a man without shoes

212
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
Or shirt

213
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
With a shovel by aside

214
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
It's like he was waiting for us

215
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
And he's so excited

216
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
Try out his English

217
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Did he sort of

218
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
Interviews himself

219
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063

I live in Senegal

224
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,767
Jimmy is the most outgoing person I met in Seneca

225
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Maybe

226
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
The most outgoing person I've ever

227
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,191
He get the buckets to sit on here for something to drink

228
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Unexplained

229
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,287

230
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
IMO bypass

231
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
IBuyPower

232
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
Bypass

233
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,943
What was that mean I mean what is it

234
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
Literally mean by pal

239
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
So by pal

240
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
The father of the Shamu

241
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,463
You you're the father of the shovel

242
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
This is your son

243
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
Father shovel

244
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,935
Ball is a time-honored job inside

245
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,751
If he says he'll get a knock on his door often

246
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
In the middle of the night

247
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
Someone's toilet

248
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
Is overflowing there

249
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
Desperate

250
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,151
And he grabs his pockets

251
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
Probably the ones

252
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
We're sitting on and his shovel

253
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
And he heads out into the night

254
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,087
Hippie stop showing me right in his own Courtyard how he does it

255
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
Is Jacque how he sort of

256
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,439
Hooks around to find the corners of the concrete

257
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
What up

258
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,119
Demonstrates how he lowers a bucket down with a rope

259
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,703
Straight months with a waste out of the pit

260
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
Polka dot one bucket at a time

261
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
Where do you put the X

262
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Super elixir

263
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
Appendages

264
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
Yeah this is the problem

265
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,599
Father shovel take this bucket

266
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,623
Build

267
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
With PCs

268
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
And urine

269
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
And God knows what else

270
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
And he takes them

271
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
Outside the house

272
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
He'll be a very big hole in the street

273
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Essentially

274
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
And he will dump bucket

275
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,959
After bucket of sewage

276
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
Into that hole

277
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
In

278
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
The street

279
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
Nobody here likes

280
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
The Neighbors

281
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,759
The oldest house on beerus the government tries to crack down on it

282
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
Expected to be to be

283
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
Somewhat defensive

284
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,135
About his job but he says listen

285
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
Keno

286
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
He knows

287
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
If this can make the

288
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
People sick in the Navy

289
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
So Sofitel

290
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Ouija

291
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
Batman group

292
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:22,751
I think you're right because it can cause some diseases in fact

293
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:27,103
Young truth and the plane on the ground sometimes they can use this song

294
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
Play with it and something like it

295
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
In which

296
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
You can cause a lot of DVDs to the children

297
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
So uneven

298
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,551
All Souls who are working with this

299
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
If a danger for us

300
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
But what can you do

301
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,951
Someone has to clean out the pit is full

302
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,023
A lot of his neighbors can't afford the truck the toilet truck

303
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
Could you be charges half the price

304
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Now

305
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,423
There have been public service campaigns to stop further

306
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
Sanitation nonprofit to come into the country and trade

307
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
Educate whole neighborhood

308
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,383
Switch inspectors prowl the back alleys looking for these holes giving up tickets

309
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
But nothing seemed to work

310
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,223
The people I talked to in the neighborhood said

311
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,039
Of course we would rather use

312
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
A truck

313
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
We just needed to be a little cheaper

314
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
And frankly

315
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
Easier to get in touch

316
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
So

317
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
How do you fight

318
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Economic Lodge

319
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
Artificially high prices

320
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
And high transaction

321
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
The Senegalese government thought

322
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
All right

323
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
We're gonna have to ask in a car

324
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,799
My name is Molly Lipscomb I'm an associate professor at the University of Virginia

325
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,615
Molly had become interested in West Africa as a p

326
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Peace Corps ball

327
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,455
She specializes in environmental issues

328
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
In developing country

329
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,783
Theories about what

330
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Might work

331
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,671
She assembled a team along with IPA Innovations for poverty action

332
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
And she translated all of this poop talk

333
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
Into economics

334
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,655
So there's definitely a market power issue and that this issue is compounded in terms of the f

335
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:59,263
Efficiency consequences by the externalities that yours

336
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,567
Sanitation issues impose on your neighborhood

337
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
Google Translate

338
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
When poop truck

339
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
Cost too much

340
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Then crap

341
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
Flo's in the streets

342
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,807
1 classic way to deal with a market power imbalance is

343
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Even the playing field

344
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
And Molly first thought

345
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,439
Maybe we can get neighbors to band together

346
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,279
Maybe she and the government could help people get a better price from the toilets

347
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,375
But when they showed up at the parking lots to make deals

348
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
The truckers

349
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
Truckers of course they thought hey

350
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,263
American Economist with a government contract

351
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,543
We can charge

352
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Even

353
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Mormon

354
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:40,735
The faces of people we're talking about when we started where in the $60 produce Legend range

355
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:46,111
Yeah so that's what we thought

356
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,695
So you start to think about ways in which you could get the service

357
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
Exactly

358
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
So how do you break a cartel

359
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,863
You could encourage other competitors to come into the market

360
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
Princess

361
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
Is a lot less powerful now that the

362
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
The US produces too much oil

363
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,031
What is the Carly giant toilet suckers

364
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,359
Are pretty expensive and it's hard to set up shop on your own

365
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
Outsiders did not want to take on this cartel

366
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,223
I know there's going to be more competition

367
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Do they were going to have to get the eggs

368
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Existing driver

369
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
To compete against each other

370
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
There was

371
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
One way

372
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
The drivers all hits cell phone

373
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,255
These basic old fashioned dumb phones

374
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
I could just get texts

375
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,143
And she starts to think what if you could somehow get around this Brotherhood problem

376
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
The cartel

377
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,495
And directly connect customers with individual Truckers

378
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Via

379
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
The self

380
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
Using your cell phone

381
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
To go directly

382
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
To a driver

383
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
It sounds familiar

384
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Do you hate it

385
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
When people call this

386
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
Uber for poop

387
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:56,255
I know I know I know you know Uber is a very well functioning market and I think they've done great things

388
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:01,375
Transportation so if this is a preferred poop that's great

389
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:07,775
Small problems using that metaphor is at the time there was no Uber in Dakar Senegal

390
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:12,127
Defect most people didn't really use their phones to shop for any kind of sir

391
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:17,503
They're going to build a whole new system for getting desperate customers in touch with poop driver

392
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
And then they're going to teach everyone how to use it

393
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
One of the members of Molly's team

394
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,903
Sanderling starting to go out

395
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Please parking lot

396
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
And to meet with the drivers

397
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,999
Show them what it would look like

398
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
To bid for jobs

399
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Using text message

400
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
The training was

401
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,423
Amazing we had I can for different Group Training

402
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
Where we invited the designated Truckers

403
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,591
And we walk them through how the bidding process would go what was the main question for

404
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Why

405
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
Why make the change

406
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,735
Yeah because at this point like

407
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,063
Things are going pretty well for them they're in demand they set their own prices

408
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
I told them

409
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,695
Imagine all the people who are sitting at home

410
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,743
With their pets overflowing

411
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,583
These are people who are not going to come to your garages

412
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,887
Even though the potential client

413
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,935
We want to help

414
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,543
Get access to these clients who have never visited you

415
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
It may never visit you

416
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
If we don't help them understand

417
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,479
Who you are what your work is and if there's an easier way to get your service

418
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,295
The researchers were super transparent with the drivers

419
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,855
They said you may not be able to charge as much

420
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
But think of all the new business

421
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
Meanwhile another member of the

422
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
The team Josh Jorge Ben

423
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,535
He was helping set up a brand new call center

424
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
Downtown Dakar

425
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,863
There's a window on the left side

426
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
Are the single desk on the right

427
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:45,567
And there's one of our operators sitting there with a little headset plugged into a cell phone on TV the government

428
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,359
Circle Rodney's animated ads

429
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
The phone number

430
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,479
There was a sort of graphic of somebody holding their nose and then

431
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:56,319
A stick drawing of Father shovel with a big red X through it and

432
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,135
And for some reason a rainbow colored toilets

433
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
What's my phone

434
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
Supplements

435
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,863
Know somebody called in the operator would answer something that then who did he know he's going to ask you questions about your location

436
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,935
And your pip was up early, with everything

437
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,543
The operator would send out a short text message to 10 or 15 randomly select

438
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Truckers

439
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
It would say something like medium pit

440
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,455
Making a good ass neighborhood and truckers had an hour to send back a text

441
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
With their best bit

442
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,783
Seduction lowest price twins

443
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,879
The trucker's could have just stuck with their cartel with the Brotherhood

444
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:36,767
They could have compared bids on their phones and all sent in a high price

445
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
But that's not what happened

446
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
CERN yearling with hanging out with the

447
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
The trucker's in the parking lot

448
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,471
And she could see cracks forming the cartel right before her eyes

449
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Quit see someone

450
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
This phone would vibrate

451
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
A trucker and he would just

452
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,919
Kind of step to the signs a hold on you guys I got to take this

453
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
And the heat go behind a truck

454
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
And we were told that they were bidding

455
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Sometimes

456
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
JustFab

457
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,367
Other truckers didn't know that you had received a bid

458
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:08,255
You say oh you know my cousin texted me or you'd say something to walk away and then respond to the bid

459
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,327
Back at the call center Josh deutschmann could see

460
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
A market

461
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Being bored

462
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
There were a couple guys that figured it out right away

463
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
They figured out

464
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,031
Okay here's the price that I think can win in this neighborhood

465
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
Started winning a lot of jobs

466
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,871
And then over time you started to see these

467
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
More and more truckers that

468
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,479
Maybe initially they would send bids but they were totally

469
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
Outlandish they were never going to win

470
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:35,135
But then they would start seeing okay this is the price that wins in this neighborhood maybe I can undercut battle

471
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
A little bit next time

472
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
And just watching start of the

473
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,767
The real-time process of

474
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
Competition

475
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,631
Unfolding over the space of weeks and months was was really really exciting

476
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,447
Because remember the price is going down

477
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
And

478
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
More truckers are participating

479
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,847
Even turkey the truck owner I talk to about the power of the Brotherhood

480
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
And the need for high prices

481
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
He got into the auction

482
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,991
He bragged to me about his strategy for winning

483
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Events near me

484
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,855
DaVinci me

485
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:10,975
Usually what I do is I wait until there are only 10 minutes left

486
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,303
10 minutes if no one

487
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,863
I think during the offer

488
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,679
Then I propose a price and then immediately I go

489
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,471
So that I have this

490
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
You said earlier

491
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
That

492
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,431
The truckers were United

493
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,759
Did the text messages to the auction

494
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
Make you less United because you were

495
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
Competing with each other for price

496
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,159
Santander

497
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,719
Even though we used to be United

498
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
But now it's a competition and you need to

499
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
Two Tylenol together

500
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
How to get something in your business

501
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,983
The Economist ran the call center as an experiment for a couple of

502
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
Tweaking the system every once in awhile

503
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,615
Is it better to have truckers just give their best.

504
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,431
Or have them give multiple bids over the hour

505
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:07,039
How many is a perfect number of truckers in an auction in their competition

506
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
You don't want so many that feels hope

507
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
You never win

508
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
Eventually Molly ran

509
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
The numbers

510
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
Did the phone auction

511
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
Make a debt

512
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
In the thing that matter

513
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,327
Can you make a dent in prices

514
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:26,239
The Excel Center brought down prices by about 7% versus the price that a given household would have

515
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
Paid

516
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
In the market

517
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,103
7% how should I feel about that seems like a small lamp

518
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Does it

519
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,199
I don't know I guess I don't know

520
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,503
Definitely like 7% off my Plumbing Service

521
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,415
Remember that the 7% is average to some neighborhoods are getting you know 12 /

522
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,463
Percent or 11%

523
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,767
And that number does not include

524
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
The transaction cost

525
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,935
People using the phone auction we're saving 1/2 days worth of travel and negotiating in that big Stadium parking lot

526
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,031
Molly said the key thing is that even a small reduction in price

527
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
Can change Behavior

528
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,895
Remember what people that car would really prefer to use

529
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
Trucks anyway

530
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,455
But they can't afford it

531
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
Even to be

532
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,271
The father shovel I talked to

533
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,087
Said he would call a poop truck

534
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
For his

535
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
If you just had more money

536
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:21,536
Molly still working on the numbers but she figures it up to 20% of people

537
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
May switch

538
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
From shovel to truck

539
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,912
If they can wrap up this project across the city

540
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
And get prices down

541
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
Big question now

542
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
Is what's going to happen

543
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
The system

544
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,360
The experiment is officially over the researchers have gone home

545
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,432
The government of Senegal ran the call center for a while

546
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,248
And now they're moving it over to a private company that will

547
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,808
Probably figure out a way to take a little cut of the business

548
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
For themselves

549
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,160
But you need to take them lesson is it the poop cartel

550
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
Will never

551
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,720
Be the same

552
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,256
The experiment showed that

553
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,536
Cartels have

554
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
A weakness

555
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,096
They can be exploited

556
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:01,472
Once you see your fellow truckers stepping outside undercut you in a text message

557
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,288
You are more likely to undercut him next time

558
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
It is brutal

559
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
But you know the old saying

560
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
Competition topic
