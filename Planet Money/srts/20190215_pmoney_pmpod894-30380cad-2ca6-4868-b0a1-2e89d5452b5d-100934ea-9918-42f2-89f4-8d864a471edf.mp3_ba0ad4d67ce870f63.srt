1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,072
We're in this moment right now where it

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,608
Feels like suddenly

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,656
There is this handful of giant

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,448
Companies that people are worried

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,008
Google Facebook Amazon

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,568
And reasonable people are starting to ask

7
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,616
Have these companies become

8
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,384
Too big

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,664
And too powerful

10
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,456
Should the government

11
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,224
Step in

12
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,552
Now these are relatively new companies but these are not

13
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,088
New questions at all

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,672
And for the next week on Planet Money we are going to tell the story

15
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,976
How the battle over these kinds of questions

16
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:35,840
Created this world we live in today where companies can get unimaginably

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,424
This episode is the first in a three-part series

18
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,960
We're starting at the very beginning

19
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,264
The first time a few companies

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,544
Suddenly seem to be

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,568
We taking over

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,688
Brely Evans

23
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,272
The history of breaking up

24
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,344
Big companies in America arguably starts

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,624
At an old house

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,416
In Titusville Pennsylvania

27
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
The childhood home

28
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,976
Of a woman named

29
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,000
Ida Tarbell

30
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:08,864
The house is still standing and actually just about 25 minutes from the small town where I grew up

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
Hi it's me to we meet Lynn Cressman she's the lead volunteer here and somehow she knows my name

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
I do know your grandma know her through my eyes

33
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
Small town

34
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,968
Anyway when was the show at this spot that little Ida Tarbell used to love

35
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,296
She opens up what looks like a closet door

36
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
It is in fact

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,368
The steepest staircase we have ever seen

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
The staircase leads up to the houses

39
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,232
Cupola like a little Tower

40
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,280
Full of Windows sunlight

41
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
Scoring in about a hundred fifty years

42
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,752
Is it Go Ida Tarbell was a brainy teenager

43
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,544
She used to come up to this Tower

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,568
The Reader books

45
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
To look through microscope

46
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
And look out the window

47
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,200
Like what would she have seen out here what would this look like

48
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,320
I think she would have seen wagons going down the street all horses

49
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,416
Pulling wagons loaded with barrels of oil and certain streets

50
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
Would have been

51
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,464
Squishing

52
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,048
Through the mud and the oil mixed together

53
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,632
Maybe that sounds gross but it was in fact a great problem

54
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
The Happening

55
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,984
How do you spell was the birthplace of the American oil into

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,360
It was the first place somebody figured out that you could use a drill to get a

57
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
Ton of oil out of the ground

58
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:30,016
Western Pennsylvania became to the oil industry with Silicon Valley is now for the

59
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
The tech industry

60
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
In the 1860s it what it seems like everybody here had an oil well or a small start-up oil refinery

61
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,256
People came from all over the country

62
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,328
To get a piece of the money just bubbling out of the ground

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,144
One of those people was Franklin Tarbell

64
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
The father

65
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
Ida Tarbell

66
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,008
Hanson Partners were into producing oil

67
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
And he was doing pretty well

68
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
He had this nice house with

69
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,152
An awesome power for his daughter Ida to hang out in

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
But one day

71
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
Ida came downstairs

72
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
And something else

73
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
Idlewood later right

74
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,392
I remember a night when my father came home with a grim look on it

75
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,256
No longer told of the funny things get seen and heard

76
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
During the day

77
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
He no longer sing

78
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:21,216
My little sister hello and welcome

79
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,616
The planet money I'm Penny Malone and I'm truly a sign then it would be 30 years for Ida Tarbell fully figure

80
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,408
Figured out what was going on that night

81
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
And what she found out

82
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,808
Would change her life and the way the United States thinks about baked

83
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,416
Today on the show Ida Tarbell versus the richest man

84
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208

00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840

95
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,856
The first start by asking you what your name in your position is

96
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,464
My name is Kathleen Brady I am a writer and biographer

97
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,791
Kathleen Brady is D Ida Tarbell biographer

98
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,351
She wrote Ida Tarbell portrait of a monkey

99
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,215
Because Ida Tarbell grew up and became a muckraker an investigative journalist but

100
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Autobiographer

101
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,591
She was a huge deal to kind of a Doris Kearns Goodwin

102
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,407
She's written this great biography of Napoleon

103
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,991
Followed up with an even more popular biography of Abraham

104
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
And one day around the year Nineteen Hundred

105
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Tarbell's

106
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
Colleagues in a magazine

107
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Ross sitting around

108
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
Trying to brainstorm her next

109
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Big crotch

110
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
And her editor Sam

111
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
McLaren like

112
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
I feel like there is one defining

113
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Issue of

114
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:58,751
They decided to take up the trust the question of the trust which they regarded is the question of the age

115
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,311
Question of trust how about this question 1st

116
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
What is a trust

117
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:08,479
After the Civil War the US was going through something kind of similar to what we're going through today

118
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Durbin's

119
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,551
Huge breakthroughs in technology

120
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,599
And they were allowing private companies

121
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
To grow bigger than they'd ever been

122
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
So when brakes are was the telegraph

123
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,791
Now you could have offices all across the country and

124
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,607
Field boss your employees around the railroad Network

125
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,935
Now your widget Factory didn't have to just serve Pennsylvania

126
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
It could ship anywhere in the country

127
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,055
Until the US economy started to consolidate

128
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
One Regional company buys another

129
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Then another in

130
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
Soon the country was left

131
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,967
With just a handful of massive

132
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Companies

133
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
What were known

134
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
As Trust

135
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Truss

136
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,159
Trust were technically a bunch of smaller companies legally stitch together

137
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
And in the end many interests

138
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
Streets were controlled by one

139
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
Trust there was a meter

140
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
Whiskey tree

141
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,631
A rope and cordage Trust

142
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
There was a barbed wire fence

143
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
And this consolidation

144
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
It happened unsettlingly

145
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Fast

146
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,079
Americans were starting to wonder

147
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
Have these companies

148
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
Become too big

149
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
Too powerful

150
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,783
So that is why Ida Tarbell and her editor Sam McClure were sitting around

151
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
Trying to figure out

152
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
Which Trust

153
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,511
I don't want to do sugar because it touched the family dinner table and McClure thought that

154
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
That was two trivia

155
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
They thought about doing meat

156
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
The big titan of meat

157
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
Just died

158
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,775
He wanted someone to profile and Ida was saying well it's got to be something like what happened in

159
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,847
In the oil industry and she was talking about that

160
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,175
Turtle recollect her own recollection of the oil industry

161
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
The oil industry

162
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
McLaren

163
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
Yes

164
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
Perfect

165
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
Oil

166
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
You were right

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
About the biggest

168
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Baddest

169
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
Trust of the mall

170
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
Standard Oil

171
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,791
Penny Malone we are here at the old Standard Oil building

172
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:04,191
It's still write your Wall Street in New York 26 Broadway and I feel like I can just imagine

173
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Exactly where we are

174
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
Looking up at this

175
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,079
Fortress of wealth in America this building is like

176
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,127
30 stories tall it's all this

177
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:18,527
Brooding concrete that Winston was here that special door knobs put on

178
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,879
I didn't know specifically how to turn these trick door knobs in order to get into certain rooms

179
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
All very big and Secret

180
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
Ida Tarbell was a biographer

181
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,791
She was going to focus on the man who ran it

182
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
Possibly the wealthiest man ever one of the most

183
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
Beard business man in the world

184
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,727
The head of the Standard Oil Company

185
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
John Deere okta

186
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
I don't have nothing

187
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,687
Knock knock you're able to find exactly one recording of Rockefeller

188
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
Video is super old it is

189
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
Weirdly unedited

190
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
Tell me when he says

191
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
Dear mr. holiday

192
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,719
Rockefellers on camera wearing a three-piece suit

193
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
And those super round glasses that you can really only pull off if you're a billionaire thanks but I'm

194
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,167
I'm not coming to the Standard Oil anniversary

195
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:12,799
I accidentally regret that it will be impossible

196
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
Sue Rockefeller

197
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:18,943
He was this mysterious Titan of industry and Ida Tarbell was going to figure out

198
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Who this man really was

199
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,807
How did he become one of the richest men in the world

200
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,087
How did he build

201
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
Is oil Empire

202
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
And so she started her investigation

203
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
She's like

204
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
You know what I need

205
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Luckily

206
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,047
Standard Oil had been involved in all these court cases

207
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
Is a big company so

208
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Turbo figured there be

209
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Plenty of records from

210
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Plus

211
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,727
She'd heard there was like a book or pamphlet

212
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,287
That contain a bunch of records from some of these

213
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
Court cases of thought

214
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:51,199
Piece of cake because they're all these court records they're only scored records

215
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
And she thought

216
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
She was just going to

217
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
Grind-it-out

218
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
What it's not what happened no

219
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
When Ida Tarbell when search

220
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
Searching for all these court records and pamphlets

221
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
They were gone

222
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,559
The records and disappeared in a lot of cases

223
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,631
Ashley disappears viciously disappeared

224
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Pamphlet

225
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,215
Entire runs of pamphlets and then bought up

226
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
And

227
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,823
She learned that standard oil had bought up all the copies

228
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,991
The man that they burn them or like I don't know what they did with them but they would assume they did they didn't want them in circulation

229
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
So she thought

230
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,599
Well I'll talk to my neighbors in Titusville

231
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:34,207
So she started contacting people back in her hometown who might have known about the cases

232
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,279
Half of them are afraid to talk to her because they thought Rock

233
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
Philly would hurt them

234
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
Some people thought you was the tool of Rock

235
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
The Feller and they didn't want to talk

236
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,215
Even her own father back in Titusville

237
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
Was leery of this project

238
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
He's very old at this point

239
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,383
But when I told him what she was up to her father said don't do it

240
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
They will ruin the magazine

241
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
And

242
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
And he was serious he was very serious

243
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,599
She was very serious you saw what happened and you saw their power

244
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,647
Nevertheless Ida Tarbell cap

245
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
And slowly

246
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
Started to piece together a portrait

247
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Of John Deere

248
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,351
Rockefeller was born in 1839 in Upstate New York

249
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
His father was a con man

250
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
He was literally a sequel sales

251
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,239
John was very different from his dad

252
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
He was a devout Baptist

253
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
And very serious about saved

254
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
He grew up and did a good business shipping produce

255
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
But

256
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
When the oil boom kicked off

257
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
He wanted in on the action

258
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
He got into the oil refining business

259
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
In Cleveland Ohio

260
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,903
And Ida Tarbell gave him credit he was great at the oil business

261
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:40,511
Instead of renting barrels to transport as well like everybody else was doing

262
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,327
He figured he could save money by making his own bear

263
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,655
He also placed his refineries ingenious location

264
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,215
It's near the water but also the train track

265
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
And that way

266
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
Did the railroads try to charge him too much

267
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
For shipping

268
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
He had a second option

269
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
But

270
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
People were telling Tarbell

271
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,223
There was something more to his success

272
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Something darker

273
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
And one day

274
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
She got a break

275
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,623
She goes down to the New York Public Library

276
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
The librarian is like

277
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:13,279
Ida remember those pamphlets that you thought at all suspiciously disappeared

278
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
Guess what I just

279
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,911
She gets this pamphlet what she fine until she found that

280
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,727
It presented the federal investigation into

281
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
Did the South Improvement oil come

282
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,567
The South improvement company

283
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:30,943
In the movie version of is Ida Tarbell with flashback to her childhood home in her little Tower

284
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
And that day her father

285
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Was so upset

286
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,319
Improvement company was less of a company

287
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,391
More of a secretive scheme from the 1870s

288
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
Come back when Ida Tarbell was still in Titusville

289
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
And it was a shady

290
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
Essentially a small group of railroad

291
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,375
Got together with a handful of oil refinery

292
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Including Rock

293
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Propeller

294
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
And they said you know what that's all the great

295
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,775
Everybody inside this deal will get

296
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
Good shipping rates for their oil

297
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
Everybody outside the deal

298
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Will get that chick

299
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,199
When Ida Tarbell was 15

300
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
Word of this deal got out

301
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
And the oil people in Titusville

302
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,599
Who were not on the inside of the steel

303
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
They were Furious

304
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
And the oil men

305
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Revolted

306
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
Interrupted and had

307
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,423
Meetings by flaming torches and Rockefeller

308
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,239
Ultimately because of all the bad press

309
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
The deal didn't

310
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
Butter freeze everybody out

311
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,103
Including Ida tarbell's father

312
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,919
That night he came home and was so upset

313
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
It was because he knew

314
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
From now on

315
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
The oil business

316
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
Would be a world

317
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
Whitby Claire's

318
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
Making secret deals

319
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,183
That Franklin Tarbell would not be apart of

320
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
And as Ida Tarbell continued her research

321
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
She learned

322
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
The disk email

323
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
But it was like a

324
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
Play book

325
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,143
How Rockefeller ended up

326
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Conquering the odds

327
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
Rockefellers company

328
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
Got big enough that he was able to go to the railroad

329
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
And start making demands

330
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
He be like

331
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
I ship a lot of oil

332
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
Do you want my business

333
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
I want a discount

334
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
Let's make this look

335
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Nightshade

336
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,599
Make it look like I get the same rights as everybody else

337
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
Then give me some money back later

338
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
Maybe more egregiously

339
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
He would also be like

340
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
Yeah you know what else

341
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,583
I'm also not so crazy about you carrying my competitors oil

342
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Let you do it

343
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,167
Just every time you do that

344
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
You also need to

345
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
These were bombshell

346
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
They meant

347
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,103
That standard oil had a secret Maybe

348
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,175
Unfair advantage over its competition

349
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
And Rockefeller

350
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Do static

351
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
1972

352
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
Rockefeller had about 30 rifle

353
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
These other refineries in

354
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,927
He basically said to them

355
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,791
You can either join me get in on this amazing Sarah Doyle stock

356
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,583
Or you have to compete with me

357
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
If you don't sell the me

358
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
I'm going

359
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
To lower my price

360
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
More than you can

361
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
And I will crush you

362
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
Of his nearly 30 rival refinery

363
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
Rockefeller was able to buy up

364
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
22 above

365
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
6 of those

366
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
In one 48 hour pee

367
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
They called this

368
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
The Cleveland

369
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Massacre

370
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,367
I kept using this move all across the country

371
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Jersey

372
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,951
Kansas and Oklahoma and California

373
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
When all the dust settled

374
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Standard Oil

375
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,119
Controlled around 90% of oil refining in America

376
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
90

377
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Percent

378
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,471
Those sketchy deals with the railroads

379
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,007
Help build his Empire

380
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
Rockefeller realized

381
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
Things could be even better

382
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,663
What if he owns the means of Transport himself

383
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
So we started buying a pipeline company

384
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
He owns so much of the oil industry

385
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,111
She could just set the price of oil where he wanted it

386
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Any did

387
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
He fixed prices

388
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,767
Ida Tarbell stories about the shenanigans of Rockefeller and standard oil

They're coming out week after week in McClure's magazine

390
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,679
And the magazine circulation was getting bigger and bigger and bigger

391
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
Ida Tarbell was making

392
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263

393
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543

Stories

397
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:24,927
Then it was expanded to 6th and it became 12b eventually made a two-volume book out of

398
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,999
Everybody was reading these stories

Theodore Roosevelt

402
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
In 1906

403
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,191
The Department of Justice filed a federal antitrust lawsuit

404
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
Against the Standard Oil

405
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
After the break

406
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
The death

407
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311

Call Titan

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,935
Written by Ron chernow

419
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
You right about this dramatic moment

420
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
At the US

421
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
Supreme Court

422
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
He writes

423
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
At 4 p.m.

424
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,895
On May 15th

425
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
1911

426
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,247
Chief justice Edward White told a sleepy courtroom

427
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Quote

428
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:26,367
I have also to announce the opinion of the court in number 398

429
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,927
The United States against the standard

430
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,535
At once the room quivered with expectation that senators and congressmen

431
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
Screamed into hear the verdict

432
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:41,215
I just started to read the decision Services kind of unusual moment

433
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
Justice white said hold up hold up

434
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,103
Before we can figure out what to do with the Standard Oil Company

435
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
We all need to get on the same page of

436
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,479
There been a law on the books from about 20 years before

437
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
Call the Sherman Antitrust Act

438
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,831
It was theoretically a way for the government

439
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
To step in

440
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
Wendy's new giant Trust

441
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Or misbehaving

442
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
But there were some big problem

443
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,023
It was vague and confusing

444
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,815
And it was mostly not working

445
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:11,167
And Justice white zeros in on this one phrase that seem to be tripping everybody

446
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
The Sherman Act said

447
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
Trust that were quote

448
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
In Restraint of

449
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Trade

450
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Weird illegal

451
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,639
But everybody was like what what does that mean

452
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
What does restrictive

453
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Trade mean

454
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
And Justice white was like

455
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,759
Well we're seeing now

456
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,831
Some of the things that Ida Tarbell had uncovered

457
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
We're clearly a Restraint of trade

458
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
Making secret deals with the railroads that

459
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,231
Forester competitors out of business

460
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Bad for trade

461
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,095
Using that leverage to buy up all your rivals

462
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:44,703
Clearly bad for competition fixing prices yeah that was obviously bad

463
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,287
The court said certainly these are examples of

464
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,103
Restraint of trade in the court use this case

465
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
Is to draw an important line

466
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
It said look

467
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,527
This guy John D Rockefeller he is really good at

468
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
His job

469
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,599
That's part of the reason why his company group

470
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
Because he's so good at business

471
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
At some point

472
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,999
Standard Oil just became a bully

473
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,071
It use its sheer size to gain unfair advantage

474
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,143
Is it had nothing to do with being a better oil

475
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
And so it grew simply

476
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
Because it was already big

477
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
Simply because it could

478
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
Restrain trade

479
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,615
The court took drastic Act

480
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
It said

481
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Standard Oil

482
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:30,271
You are in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act

483
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,063
And we are going to break up

484
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
This company

485
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
It will bunch of smaller

486
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
It was a

487
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Huge deal

488
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
But it was all for naught

489
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,767
Because even after the decision

490
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Rockefeller was like

491
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Hey

492
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,887
How about the officials from all these new companies

493
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,215
Still meet every morning at 10:30 at Standard Oil head

494
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
Again Ida Tarbell biographer

495
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Kathleen Bray

496
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
Ida

497
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,615
Correctly saw

498
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
That

499
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:03,039
Now instead of one company there were thirty-three supposedly separate companies actually

500
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
Coordinating with each other

501
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
And

502
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,415
And in addition to everything else

503
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,999
Along Came the automobile and the demand for oil

504
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Increased

505
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
It was actually 34 cup

506
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
Companies in Rockefeller still got stock

507
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
And that was even better business for him

508
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
All those new Mini Standard Oil

509
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
They were still oil companies

510
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
Oil with good business

511
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,895
They became some of the biggest companies in the world

512
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
Exxon

513
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Mobile

514
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,735
ConocoPhillips Chevron

515
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,551
Rockefeller just became richer than ever

516
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,855
So Ida really

517
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,183
Didn't feel she had achieved her goal

518
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,999
At all I'm sorry to say I mean

519
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:49,887
Her goal was to tell a story and that she did but she did not feel that rock

520
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Feller was

521
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,471
Punished in any way

522
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
4

523
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
Breaking the law

524
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
But

525
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
This case

526
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
Against Standard Oil

527
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:05,503
And that moment when the Supreme Court said let's clarify the Sherman Antitrust Act

528
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
This would be important

529
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,343
The rest of antitrust history

530
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
This clarification

531
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
Wood by the cord for

532
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
Decades and decades

533
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
It help the government

534
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,303
To go after misbehaving Corporation

535
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
And you know I look back at this

536
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Case

537
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,655
At this moment when

538
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
When the country was really discovering

539
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,031
There is a strange tension

540
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
In free markets

541
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Free market

542
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,151
Is great because it promotes competition

543
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,711
Companies have to battle it out if it makes

544
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
Cheaper or

545
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,783
Better and that is great for consumers

546
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
But businesses

547
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
You're not necessarily like,

548
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,951
I'm over here selling my thing it's going great then

549
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,559
Somebody comes along and sells it for less or sells a better version I don't want that

550
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,863
So I'll just buy up all my rivals

551
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
Before they put me out of

552
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,959
Before you know it I have eliminated all compass

553
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,543
The free market is good because it leads to competition

554
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
But the free market also can lead

555
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
Do a lack of

556
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,663
One of the main points

557
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
Civ antitrust law East

558
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Solve this problem

559
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,319
To use government intervention to make free market competition work

560
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
The Standard Oil case showed

561
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,440
That the federal government was willing to do this

562
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,488
Step into the market

563
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,768
In a huge way

564
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
Try to make the market work

565
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:28,448
Next time on Planet Money

566

Wait is this it is the whole

00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,560
That is the National Historic Landmark

586
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
That whole

587
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:34,752
And I don't know I don't know if our whole is the only National Historic Landmark or not

588
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,800

Ton of oil out of the ground

594
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,832
It happened in 1859

595
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:53,696
And the whole still actually producing a tiny bit of oil

596
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
Can I taste it
