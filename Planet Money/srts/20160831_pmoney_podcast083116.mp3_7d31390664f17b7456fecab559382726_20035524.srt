24
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:49,664
From looking at this but this is a spanish-language soap opera

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
Telenovela they call it

26
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,248

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528
Hippy program

They're very over-the-top Gotti

30
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:03,232
The acting can be pretty shoddy but above all very melodramatic

31
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,840
Yeah every single emotion is the most extreme emotion so every time like

32
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,376

Yeah no one's ever like pass me the sugar

40
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:30,112

And she almost immediately realized

152
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
She had made a terrible mess

153
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,191

And you know

157
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,687
At that time I would meet with actresses and and they were like oh I think you need a nose job and I was like

158
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,343
I'm at such a sweet warm person

159
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623

And she felt like her soul was die

166
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,751
So she called up the head writer for the Telenovela

167
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,079
And ask for something that I guarantee no one ever asked for any shows

168
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
Would you kill me

169
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
You know would you mind

170
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
Killing my character off

171
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
But you literally asked

172
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
The character

173
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:50,367

00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
Yeah there's a lot of

191
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,351
Sunset and rolling around on the beach in a swelling of romantic music

192
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
If you don't want to get pregnant just never go near

193
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
Is excellent advice

194
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
So you can imagine this

195
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,823
Surprised when Fela wrote a Telenovela about

196
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,895
A young woman who is a virgin and gets

197
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
Accidentally

198
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
Artificially

199
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Inseminate

200
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,063
The it's basically takes place in her uterus the whole novela

201
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
It's called quanon

202
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,743
Or Jane the Virgin us version of this I have watched it is a remarkable show

203
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,303
Because it makes fun of the genre but it's also

204
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
Really sweet

205
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,167
It's genius I mean they're talking about sex

206
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:12,031
But she's a virgin and they're they're playing on all these themes of Purity and

207
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
Sexuality

208
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
But it's not too risky

209
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,919
Sapele got really good at doing these eyes

210
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
Twists on classic romantic

211
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Telenovela

212
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,551
But then something happened that made it so she had to leave

213
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Venezuela

214
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,391
It was the early 2000s and violent country

215
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Was starting to be a pro

216
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,999
Different situations have happened that were

217
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,095
At the beach house we were some people came in an hour

218
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
I was almost kidnapped

219
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,679
At the third time that I got

220
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,519
A gun pointed at my head I said okay I think it's time to go

221
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:49,151
And sew in 2003 Butler move to Miami to be the VP of telenovela development

222
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,711
It's at a television network called the pneumonia

223
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,527
I don't know the sound glamorous you know this Tommy

224
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,855
Telenovelas for the US population will you really made it now

225
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,439
But you have to remember at the time Telemundo was a second

226
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Rate

227
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,047
Network they had declared bankruptcy they've been bought by NBC

228
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:10,655
And they were just starting to make their own telenovelas build Studios but mostly

229
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
They were doing

230
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
WeChat

231
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,263
Novellas Buffet Dunn from South America and Mexico

232
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Plus

233
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
There was a huge rival out there

234
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
Perhaps you've heard of it

235
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Univision

236
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
Univision

237
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Was

238
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
The top

239
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
Network for Spanish-speaking

240
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
They were the ones that had the very best telenovelas

241
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,087
They had soccer

242
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,367
Univision

243
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
Was always number one and they were always going to be enough

244
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
So like in telenovela lingo

245
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,327
Univision will be like the rich powerful uncle

246
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,143
The mustache and Telemundo would be like the pores

247
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
Scrappy boy who who

248
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Big dream

249
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
UniFirst

250
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
The dreams were

251
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,335
We can even feed Univision we want to be as good as they are

252
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
I thought you know

253
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
This is the Golden Age of

254
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,015
Television Lake why are we just trying to out Univision Univision

255
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,087
Like what were their viewers watching when they weren't watching telenovelas

256
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
They're watching The Sopranos

257
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
They're watching The Wire

258
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
Watch Mad Men and Breaking Bad

259
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
So you have a

260
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
Renaissance of

261
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
Great TV

262
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
In the English language Market

263
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Dad

264
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,983
I think our viewers are are are being exposed to

265
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,311
So it's hard to ignore the fact that

266
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Hey

267
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
You know what why would

268
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
Spanish language television be

269
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
How to completely lower level

270
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,295
Dan English language television and we we look at ourselves and we said no

271
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
Absolutely not

272
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
I'm going to try to

273
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,671
Create stories and an unproduced oh stories

274
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
Add a level

275
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
That people can say listen

276
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,559
This is not dramatically different

277
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351
Then what's in English language

278
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
So Perla is out there looking for

279
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Different ideas

280
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Fort Nova

281
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,287
Trying a lot of things some do well others bomb

282
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
But there's this one moment

283
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
It turns out to be crushed

284
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
2011

285
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
But that was looking everywhere Friday

286
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
I've have

287
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Next to my bed

288
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
A mountain of books

289
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:09,183
Whenever I'm in the weekends I just want to have a little more time

290
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
I

291
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
Stay in bed and I read

292
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
She picks up his book

293
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
Called La Reina Del Sur

294
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
The queen of the South

295
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:20,191
It is a novel but it's written by Spanish journalist and it is unusual taking the drug war

296
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
And she decides

297
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
Hey this could

298
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
Make a Telenovela

299
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
It starts off like the class

300
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
There's this girl

301
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
Teresa Mendoza

302
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,455
Poor girl in Mexico

303
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
Some drug Runner he's

304
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
The really nice guy

305
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
Do you know where this is

306
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,623
Almost immediately

307
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
He gets murdered like in the very

308
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,743
First episode the love interest is gone

309
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:49,887
It's recent she gets raped by his rival you managed to escape first of the US and then to Spain

310
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:54,239
And the rest of the story is sort of about revenge and her rise to power

311
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
Teresa

312
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,079
Turned out to be an excellent drug lord

313
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,687
Telenovela audiences had never seen anything like that at 7.

314
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
We had a

315
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,039
Female protagonist that was completely

316
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
Opposite

317
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,367
To the typical

318
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
Novella protagonist

319
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
I mean she she killed

320
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,303
She killed people and she was a lesbian

321
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
In the character

322
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,447
And that's where protagonist is huge I mean imagine coming from a

323
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,103
Did telenovelas her classical to learn about his could you ever imagine having that kind of a

324
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,687
A possibility so you know it was a big risk

325
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
Puerto Madero

326
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,575
They were in second place they're willing to try anything in order to beat up the capital

327
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
Univision

328
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,207
So the reality is is that when you are used to not winning

329
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
You take more chances

330
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
You have nothing to lose

331
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:56,191
They wanted this product to look like nothing you had ever seen before on telenovelas end of the first thing they do

332
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Did is they spent money

333
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
On

334
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:03,871
Amazing

335
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Mexican

336
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
Kate del Castillo

337
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
Let me just show you

338
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
Cuz

339
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
She is sensitive

340
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:16,159
This is Kate del Castillo Robert music

341
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
So she is a

342
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
She's a gorgeous

343
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
Brunette but she's like

344
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
Has this intense look

345
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
All the time but she

346
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Looks like

347
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
She wants to kick your ass

348
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
No and she does that mean that's what she

349
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
She does me

350
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,055
We just totally unlike the sort of

351
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,615
Yu-Gi-Oh gazing up into the

352
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,223
Eyes of the man you normally see in a ton

353
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,039
A lot at all in this whole than a novella

354
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,879
Spanish language television

355
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
Finally had

356
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
There Tony Soprano

357
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
Kate del Castillo

358
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,863
Yeah okay but I got to say this was not just revolutionary for Spanish language Telugu

359
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,447
I mean this was like a big deal for television in general

360
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,335
Yes in English language TV there's the rise of the anti-hero but how many of those anti-heroes are women

361
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
What's a dude

362
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,431
It is mostly dudes and Kate del Castillo has

363
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
A look

364
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
They could match them all

365
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,295
Yeah and you know what some people weren't ready

366
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:20,927
We got to remember is in Mexico there's a drug war and The Mexican government is like do not do this

367
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
If you are glorifying the drug war

368
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,815
I think they push to have it banned in Venezuela it is

369
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
The first episode

370
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,191
A queen of the South with the highest rated Premiere in the networks

371
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
2.4

372
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,543
Million viewers 5 Second month of the year

373
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
It was number one in Primetime beating out

374
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,943
Not just Univision not that the other spanish-language rival

375
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,991
But English language programming to

376
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Telemundo

377
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,807
Was stunned

378
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
By the way

379
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
What are the head writers Roberto

380
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,903
He was always the guy who started the

381
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,511
How do I hide a bottle of tequila in his office and every time the ratings

382
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,607
Would arrive he would open up the tequila bottle and go around

383
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
Let's have a little shot of tequila so yes

384
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
It was that good it was that good

385
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
Let me tell you a story

386
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,383
About how culturally dominant this program

387
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:16,991
Sure it was watched by Latinos all across America men loved women loved it

388
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
Internationally famous

389
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Drug lords

390
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
We're watching this

391
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
After only one that we know

392
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
Yeah but she was the big one

393
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
Walking

394
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
Loera Guzman

395
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,815
El Chapo El Chapo the Most Wanted drug lord

396
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,167
In the world the man who knows cell can contain who digs tunnels

397
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,983
Out from prison under the US Mexico border

398
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:43,871
El Chapo fell in love with Kate Del Castillo's character or Kate del Castillo he probably got them

399
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
Arduino this

400
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,711
Because when he was captured

401
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
They

402
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
Captured his text message

403
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,039
They were public

404
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,599
And pizza things telenovelas

405
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Armada

406
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
I will play El Chapo

407
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
ISO

408
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
Want to meet you

409
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
And get to be very good friend

410
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
You are the best thing

411
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,215
In this world we are going to be very

412
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Good friend

413
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
I will take better care of

414
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,383
Can I take care of my own eyes

415
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
It must be too much

416
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,039
When you tell me that you're going to take care of me

417
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
No one has ever taken care of me

418
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
Thank you

419
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
I'm free next weekend

420
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Okay

421
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
Folded story

422
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
At all

423
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
What happened next

424
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
Was amazing

425
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,983
Kate went to visit El Chapo the Most Wanted Man in Mexico

426
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
An escaped prisoner

427
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,079
And she met him the jungle and she brought along

428
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Her friend

429
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,151
Actor Sean Penn

430
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
Who is reading an article

431
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Rolling Stone

432
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,599
Yeah two of the most famous actors in the world going to the jungle and

433
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
Guess what that raises a little bit of

434
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
Suspicion so Mexican authorities

435
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
They captured El Chapo

436
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Because of this

437
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,327
Yeah and when they searched his hideout

438
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
They found what you would expect

439
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
International criminal

440
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
Weapons cell phone

441
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Hair dye

442
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
Signature mustache

443
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
And of course

444
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,055
Several DVDs of La Reina Del Sur

445
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,871
As a fan of the show and tell

446
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
I should have known

447
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
How

448
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
This was going to end

449
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,527
Because it doesn't end well for The Descent Mendoza in the Telenovela

450
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
In the last episode

451
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
She is

452
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
Heavily pregnant

453
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,927
All by herself everyone she loves

454
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
Has been killed by her

455
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
Or by someone else

456
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,839
And she just looks out into the Horizon and rubbing her belly

457
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
You got this feeling that

458
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,959
She's incredibly lonely and probably going to be in trouble

459
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,031
It's the least romantic Sunset ever

460
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
In a Telenovela

461
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
Right it's Dawn

462
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
.

463
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,503
The president of Telemundo Luis silberwasser says this

464
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Was

465
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
The turning point this

466
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
If hou Telemundo

467
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
Went to the top

468
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
All of us

469
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,975
Who have something to do with Spanish language television remember La Reina Del Sur

470
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
And I think I think it did

471
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
Signal

472
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
2

473
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,911
The market in general and to Telemundo internally

474
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
The Telemundo could do something really big

475
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007
And could break

476
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
Into the Spanish language and become a

477
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
A real alternative

478
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:29,247
And we did with that type of story being very real very dramatic

479
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
With a lot of action

480
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
I'm not your standard

481
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Telenovela

482
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
That we could actually

483
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Dino get big big nut

484
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,511
Telemundo had found a new formula

485
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
In fact they dropped

486
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,631
The name telenovela and came up with a new name for this thing

487
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
Think I'm super sweet

488
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,471
I prepare like it was like this aha moment

489
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,775
It's about the kind of character

490
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
People want

491
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
Just with the time that we're living

492
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,431
I think it's also a reality in the General Market

493
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
People

494
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
Doane relay

495
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
To the

496
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
Positive

497
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,623
Characters although what makes them human

498
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,439
They are billions but they're not absolutely villains

499
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
The humans

500
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
So you see the humanity

501
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
They make mistakes

502
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,351
All you have to do right now is look at the lineup

503
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,935
Telemundo they have a show called Senora Acero

504
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
Which is about a

505
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
A woman who works as a

506
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
The human Smuggler

507
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
On the US map

508
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
Border

509
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,407
You have an upcoming show called lasagna

510
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,455
It's another language

511
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
Centos a lot about violence

512
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
It's against women which is something

513
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
Honestly you don't see

514
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
In telenovelas

515
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,463
And they're also going to be premiering a serious called Chavez El comandante

516
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
I guess it's about

517
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
The

518
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,071
Biggest anti-hero of them all in Latin America

519
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,167
Right now

520
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
That is totally telling about that I would watch

521
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
Watch

522
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
