Can you get

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,144
Hey before we get started this episode is about Amazon and we should note that Amazon is one of NPR's many financials

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,752
3 2 1

31
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
Brian see where we are right now

32
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848
Where in Long Island City in Queens just got off the subway

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,504
And we're here because Amazon just announced that they are going to build a brand new headquarters quarters

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,064
Quarters because he can't have 3 headquarters fair enough

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
Either way this is a very big deal

36
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,672
Hundreds of communities across the country competed for this

37
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,536
Amazon's going to be bringing 25000 jobs to Queens and billions of dollars in

38
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,072
It's right here got it they want

39
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
But almost immediately the reaction

40
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
And here was like no

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,936
No we don't want to win we don't want this

42
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
There have been protests across the city

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,592
People saying things like Amazon is going to force all the mom and pop shops out of business

44
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,664
They're going to drive rents up so people will be displaced

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,968
The subway is going to get even more crowded

46
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:33,088
But the thing that really upset people is that the state and the city agreed to give Amazon

47
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,672
1.2 billion dollars in tax breaks over 10 years

48
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
To come here

49
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,280
More like 500 million in cash to help build

50
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
The new quarters

51
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
So it looks like a massive subsidy

52
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,984
For massive company very controversial and we even had this fight in our own office

53
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,568
Some of us think the potential pain is worth it for 25000

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,920
And some of us were like no no New York got a bad deal from a corporate bully

55
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,992
And this argument was really intense and I couldn't stop thinking about it

56
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:06,880
I think it was actually at Hardin argument about capitalism about weather what's good for business

57
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
Really is good for everyone

58
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
Which for a long time

59
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
What's on the thing we were talking about

60
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,840
But the fact is no one in our office actually lives in Long Island

61
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,656
Us we don't know if people out here or going to be

62
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,936
Be thrilled or horrify

63
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,264
I thought you and I looked at each other at this argument was close

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
Singer like

65
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
But we got to go out there

66
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:29,152
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm your wealth and brynhurst on the move

67
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
We're spending the show walking around a neighborhood that is at the heart of a really Fierce National debate Economist and politicians have been

68
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
Been talking about this a lot

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,648
Is business investment in the community

70
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
Worth some of the drawbacks

71
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
The tax breaks

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
The gentrification

73
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,048
The loss of a neighborhood character

74
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,912
Today we're going to let the people who live and work in this neighborhood do the talk

75
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
What are you doing

76
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704

By the way before we get started there is one swearing electrician

93
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
In this episode

94
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,823
Okay so we went out to Long Island City and we walked around all day starting in the more

95
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
That is the sound of Long Island City like they are just

96
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
Constantly putting up buildings out here

97
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,295
740 Towers in like a last 10 years and it sounds like this all the time

98
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
Utica Silvia Tower

99
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
It looks like they're going to stop at about 4 but I don't know

100
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
But that poor story

101
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
Yeah I mean it's like

102
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,743
It's like they put on a busy man show like rich

103
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,839
Richard scarry's busy City like literally those guys are moving ladder someone setting a hammer

00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
Ace crane

105
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
It's like a child

106
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
View of what a construct

107
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Insight would be like

108
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,871
For a lot of years this neighborhood was mostly industrial is a lot of factories and warehouses

109
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
17 years ago the city change the zoning laws so now you can build other stuff including these big tall

110
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Condo Towers

111
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:16,927
We are heading down 44th drive to the East River because that's where I was on

112
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
Restart

113
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
Grabbing people in the street

114
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,375
1 guys getting out of a white van by a construction site he's got black bandana

115
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
Tinted glasses

116
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
His name is Jeff San Pedro

117
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
Do you live in Long Island City

118
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
I know I don't but I work here

119
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,519
You work here and you work in

120
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
I'm an electrician

121
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Okay

122
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,383
So this seems like a good neighborhood to be an Electra

123
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
Yes it does

124
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,223
Start building up all over the place in Long Island City

125
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
And I like.

126
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,575
Have you heard about Amazon coming to Long Island City

127
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
Yes I have heard that

128
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
What do you think

129
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
I love

130
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:53,279
I really do I think it's great that Amazon's yet because it's going to bring more more jobs here

131
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
I mean 20 years ago

132
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,167
You don't work with self 4020 is good it was that much work now you always special

133
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
Was going to come to Long Island City to work

134
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
Right now Long Island City is a hotspot

135
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
If you look on old

136
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
These corners

137
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
Varicella crane

138
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
Praying praying pois

139
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Everywhere

140
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
Are you worried that there could be any downside to Amazon

141
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Gentrification

142
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
Y'all really wanna go there

143
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
I mean a lot of people are worried about

144
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,415
I think people are just dumb

145
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
I know they have phobias

146
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Sub certain things

147
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
Since

148
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:29,887
Like

149
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
People scared of change

150
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
Oh yeah

151
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
They're scared of change

152
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,567
But you know what changes good if it puts money in your pocket why not

153
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Your capitalist

154
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,407
No I mean opportunist

155
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,551
Okay capless I don't have enough money to be capitalist

156
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,463
You gotta have money to make money

157
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,351
How to rich person using you make a good living but you're not a rich person you don't have to call

158
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,935
But you don't have any of that knee-jerk like all this is busy bad for work

159
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,495
Do people know I have my pain so give me wrong

160
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
57 I got my pain

161
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
But up

162
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
Like I said you know what

163
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
You work hard

164
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
Everyday get up for 45

165
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,503
Why when we get comes I party hard so I don't hear from nobody

166
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
I'm sorry but that's the way it is

167
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623
He was like a walking

168
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,767
Springsteen song I Know I Know upper blue collar I don't think Springsteen could have written that better

169
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
Alright let's talk about what we heard Jeff say there

170
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
He said to him

171
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
Jobs are the most important

172
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
And Amazon is bringing

173
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
25000 jobs

174
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:43,871
Now those jobs we should pay on average are expected to pay more than $150,000 a year

175
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
So

176
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:50,527
People are going to be spending money in this neighborhood getting lunch going to the grocery store go to the pharmacy

177
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:55,391
Yeah and like I said there will be other jobs to wiring buildings delivering meals

178
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
Fixing the elevator

179
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,583
All the things that Amazon will basically pay people who don't work at Amazon to do

180
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
I'm already calls the local multiplier

181
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,495
He's in a bunch of research and he's found that when a high-tech company like Amazon Comes To Town

182
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,335
It creates one job and five other jobs in the same city

183
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Papa

184
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
That's over the span of 10 years

185
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
So you went ahead to talk to more

186
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,759
People and I kind of just rattled around the street like looking at things and I just

187
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:28,159
Love Long Island City like people actually do stuff here they build things and they repair things and it's all hidden inside these

188
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
He's like dingy looking garages

189
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,047
Just look in the window of this completely run down red garage door that has a

190
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
View glass paint left

191
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,887
Siri tell me what you see in there

192
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,727
Run-down garage door

193
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,287
Whoa whoa whoa that's like the offense

194
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,639
The car from an 80s movie those are all old Ferraris

195
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,455
Hundreds of thousands of dollars

196
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
Yep I'm not really a car guy but

197
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
Try to open the door

198
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Hell no

199
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,903
These cool hands dirty businesses like the car repair shops

200
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,719
They will probably get replacement Amazon

201
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
They're not going to survive

202
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
Yeah that's going to be a salsa

203
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:11,423
And we were standing there in the street talking about this and this woman overheard us and she walked up to us and you basically

204
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,751
I grabbed the microphone I was like I have something to say about

205
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,359
My turns before you know it on Vernon Boulevard instead of mom and pop stores

206
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
You going to find the gap

207
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
Her name was Roberta Burger

208
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,735
She's a Potter she works an art studio here

209
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
She says

210
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
That's a lot of artists Studios

211
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,671
That were in Brooklyn that are now in Long Island City and they see it happening

212
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
To them yet again

213
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
And yeah classic artist move in

214
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
Giant corporations like a wheel of artist we want a piece of the action

215
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
Have your neighborhood

216
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,447
After we were talking to Roberto we got disoriented for a second

217
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
I'm trying to get my bearings here

218
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
What street is that can you read that

219
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
That is Hunter Street

220
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
Alright so so

221
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
What's going to happen if

222
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
This time 10

223
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,319
I need you to talk about your mouthful giving that you work on the radio please

224
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:05,183
So well you chewed we walked toward the water toward the East River where Amazon's going to be

225
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,743
And there's just not a lot happening up here

226
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
There's nothing happening

227
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
One guy smoking a cigarette

228
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
Couple people walking

229
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,191
And at this point we're just a couple steps away from the East River

230
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
There's a boat here

231
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,567
Like someone just pulled up their boat and left it on the war

232
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,151
I'm going to cross the river you can see the UN building Midtown Manhattan

233
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,967
We couldn't go any further without getting really wet so we turned around

234
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,831
Right behind this is one of the buildings that people are most worked up about and legitimately

235
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
It's a building owned by the

236
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
Board of Education

237
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,719
And it had originally been slated to be turned into

238
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
High-rises

239
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
Of which 1000 Apartments would be for affordable housing

240
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
But that is not happening

241
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
Amazon is taking that spay

242
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
This is not a fancy building

243
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
Like it's about six stories

244
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Stall and it's

245
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
It's an entire block

246
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:58,175
And it's as Bland as could be and I don't think anyone ever would have talked about it if Amazon hadn't showed up

247
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
It's pale yellow

248
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
And there's

249
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,039
I mean there's a lot of air conditioners

250
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,367
Why does the Board of Ed need a loading dock

251
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
Let's go ask

252
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,511
Hi I'm just truck with just trying to figure out

253
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,095
We're doing a story about the new Amazon headquarters

254
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
Okay right now

255
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
You can't talk to no pressure

256
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,191
You know let's talk to the Press right now

257
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,031
Okay. Are you at least want to tell me what what's in that this building

258
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
This is the Board of Education open

259
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,919
Why do you guys have a loading dock at the Board of Education

260
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
I'm going to go away

261
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
I'm going away

262
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,855
I think at least half of the outrage over Amazon coming here

263
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Is about housing

264
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,207
People are worried that this is going to become a neighborhood where

265
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,255
Only rich people can afford to live

266
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,607
And if they do, they're going to be living right next to America's largest

267
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,631
Public housing project

268
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
Let's go. Let's go find the Queensbridge houses

269
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
It was about a 10-minute walk away

270
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
It doesn't seem

271
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
Particularly close

272
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,663
It's not I mean that's the funny thing is people have been making a really big deal about Queensbridge

273
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
And yet

274
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
Get 6600 people live here

275
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,343
What kind of looking at a huge field of 6 story building

276
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,927
I called shut it together an odd angle surrounded by little parks

277
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
It's been here for 79 years

278
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,047
The median household income here is under $16,000

279
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,095
So there are some very poor people living here

280
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,447
Sweet way for the first guy we saw all right there underneath the Queensboro Bridge and we asked him what do you think

281
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
I really don't think it's a problem

282
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,055
You don't think it's a problem

283
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
You know they can really

284
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
We can help the community you known

285
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
What jobs and everything like that

286
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,015
Sylvia Browne is a nurse who grew up here everybody's afraid of change you know

287
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,599
Part of this reaction to Amazon people being like

288
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,671
I just don't want something new coming down the pike

289
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
I think so

290
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:52,351
My mother feels the same way about it she kind of has that same type of fear I don't know I don't like it and you know

291
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:57,727
Three things the way it is they not they trying to get us out of here and stuff like that you know so I don't know

292
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,543
Is any of the fear real or is most of the fear just like

293
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Chainsaw

294
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
We all know that

295
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
I think it's

296
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
A real Fair

297
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
Really

298
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,783
That's a real Fair people are afraid that the city might tear down

299
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
The Queensboro

300
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
Housing Development

301
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Absolutely

302
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
Why aren't you afraid of that

303
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
I am

304
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:25,119
Is it fair to me to absolutely I'm not sitting here saying all day I'm not worried but I am

305
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:30,239
But you're smiling and also saying that you think Amazon coming here is a good thing

306
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
Change is always good

307
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,871
Keeping a big company like Amazon cares about a place like Queensbridge

308
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
I wouldn't say

309
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,943
Per say they care about

310
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
Queensbridge

311
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
I just think they

312
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
Is it busy

313
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
I'm saying whoever wants

314
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
To work level needs

315
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
Jobs you go out there and get it I don't think they supposed to say what we're going to put this here cuz we care about you know

316
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,423
This is not a Community Development

317
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
This is exactly what everyone is fighting about

318
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,055
Some people want Amazon held to specific standards like

319
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,127
They have to hire people from this local community

320
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,175
They have to make investments

321
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
It's in the local community

322
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:16,319
And in fact Amazon has agreed to collaborate with New York City

323
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
To build a school down

324
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:24,767
And other people to like that is not their job which is basically my position Amazon is a business it's supposed to deliver

325
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
Packages show me movies

326
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
It's the government's job

327
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
To build schools by taxing Amazon

328
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,703
So we walked around Queensryche for a while talking to

329
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
People

330
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
Lacey Gibbs who's retired had some very specific advice for the people who are complaining about Anna

331
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,479
Get yourself together to meet the criteria to have a job at Amazon

332
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,063
I kind of stood up a little straighter when she was talking to me and she seemed really annoyed

333
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
Like by the negative

334
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
They take the rumor about the housing

335
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Being sold off

336
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
You're rolling your eyes

337
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Yeah

338
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
It's not together and if they self

339
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
The apartments

340
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,119
Be ready to buy it

341
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
The city is not dissolving the project

342
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
By the way that's a rumor is not a plan

343
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,055
And then Lacey's friend came by and she called him over I asked him to spell his name

344
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,103
Hollis

345
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Jack

346
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
Json

347
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
Jr. Hollis Jackson Jr he felt he had got himself together and it hadn't worked do you know anyone here

348
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
It was a college degree who is looking for a job

349
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,951
Yammy Kansas community college degree in business management

350
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
He's 56 years old

351
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
And he says he's watched

352
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,351
Businesses especially in the past couple of years hotels

353
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,911
Come out to Long Island City and then just

354
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,983
Ignore all of these local residents who want work

355
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,031
First of all the offering of

356
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
The jobs

357
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
Need to come out

358
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,175
Oh you mean the hotels don't come out to clean fridge and I put up signs a now hiring

359
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
That hasn't happened with them

360
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,807
That hasn't happened I don't believe that that's going to happen with Amazon

361
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,647
What do they need to come to you when should you get out there

362
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,975
Dot-dot-dot knock on my door

363
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
I have a job for you

364
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
Of course not it doesn't work that way

365
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
But it should be one hand washes

366
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,887
The other I need employment

367
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
You need a customer

368
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
Hire me

369
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
But I can be a customer of

370
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Your company

371
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,847
To be able to pay for that could be able to

372
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,687
The argument he's making is basically the tiniest possible version of an

373
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,015
An economy but of course Amazon doesn't need to hire Hollis they don't

374
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
Need his business either

375
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
They already have everybody else's

376
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Okay

377
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
So what did we learn today

378
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Well

379
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,351
The results of our hard anecdotal research RN

380
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
And basically

381
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,191
Some people are pretty and Amazon moving into the neighborhood

382
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
They talked a lot about you

383
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,383
He did and even the people who thought they might be negatively affected like their rent might go up Stacy

384
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
Pretty resume

385
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:56,063
Yes Potter was like, Potter is part of my job to get displaced and Sylveon Sylveon the nurse who said his

386
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
Mom is worried about the project being torn down

387
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,207
He said he doesn't think it's really going to happen but if it does

388
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,999
He will find another place to live

389
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,351
Yep he was pretty realistic about that we did hear a lot of realism in this neighborhood

390
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
Today which made me think

391
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
Amazon coming here

392
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,543
Feels like a good thing for New York or at the very least for this neighbor

393
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Long Island City

394
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,127
I feel like the anxieties about capitalism as

395
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
System

396
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
We're just

397
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
Lot less acute

398
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,783
Here on the ground and they were in the officer that we're reading online or whatever

399
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,135
And we can taking out on the mat and we just talked about that for a second

400
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
Like it's pretty

401
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:38,303
A billion plus dollars for all those jobs it's just not that much over 10 years in the state is picking up a lot of it

402
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,119
All those multiplier jobs like that feels real

403
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,447
I think the city just gets way more money

404
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
But they can spend on whatever they want

405
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
And it seems like a lot of New York

406
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,639
Seems to agree I was looking at a poll on my phone

407
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,735
New Yorkers by a margin of two-to-one are happy about Amazon coming here

408
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,599
Hard anecdotal research confirm by quick plant that cell phone

409
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
But but we need to be fair

410
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:07,487
There is a group of people that we didn't hear from today we just didn't meet any of them

411
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,583
And these are the critics that the folks who are fiercely opposed to this

412
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
They exist

413
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,167
They've held marches and rallies

414
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:19,263
At one point it was raining and we stopped into a bar to get dry

415
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,567
On the TV news there was an anti Amazon

416
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
Has kind of Hazard cuz we were sitting

417
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
This bar and we were

418
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:29,247
Basically the only ones there I think there's one other couple I did not

419
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:34,367
Feel like that and we're watching on TV where people have taken over the Amazon bookstore in Manhattan

420
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
And meanwhile under the television

421
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:42,303
The bartender was just standing there going to wiping down the counter whatever just talking her ears off about how she couldn't wait for a

422
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,631
Amazon to get here she thinks it's going to be really good for business

423
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
All right

424
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
New York weather

425
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,287
But there is another reason everyone is freaking out and it doesn't have anything to do with Long Island City

426
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
Or New York

427
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,127
Or the quarters and it's a much

428
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
Bigger question

429
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
And that question is

430
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,783
Is Amazon good for America

431
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
I think we're going to have to do another show

432
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
Go visit America
