This is planet money from NPR

9
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,784
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm taken quotes

10
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:29,696
Our friends at the NPR Podcast rough translation recently put out a request on our show and on their show

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,768
Best listeners to call in with stories of times they work on

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
Scam

13
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,352
And they got almost 200 response

14
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:40,192
They turn those responses into a great episode they just published it

15
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
You can go listen to

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,872
One of the stories they included in their show was just so delightful and so Illuminating that we said

17
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,688
We have got to run this one as a Planet Money

18
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,248
So that's what today's episode is

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,576
And now I'm just going to turn the show over to Gregory Warner

20
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,856
The host of rough translation

21
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,416
In 2010

22
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:05,024
Felipe Fernandez was laid off from his it job at Hewlett-Packard in Costa Rica

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,304
Play bass Costa Rica

24
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,608
The layoff was a huge blow

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,656
He didn't know what he's going to do next

26
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,984
Someone from his family believe they didn't want me to say who

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
Approached him with a potential job there was a business that needed an IT person which side

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,432
Sounds good he was an IT guy

29
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,504
He did work so I was obviously curious

30
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,552
What he said was

31
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:32,416
We actually run the scam on senior citizens

32
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
The people who needed the IT guy

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,048
They were in the business of calling of people steal their money

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,096
Senior citizens in the USA

35
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
Hello Operator

36
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
Except we have a script

37
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
All you have to do is

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,288
Call and call and call until someone bites

39
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
You know the script

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,872
Ma'am I've good news for you

41
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,944
You have won a sweepstakes prize

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
A four and a half

43
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,016
Million dollars

44
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,832
All you have to do to collect that prize

45
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:05,440
Is wire a small deposit for insurance policy that is $4,500

46
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,000
And you can send that today by Western Union

47
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,840
I was very doubtful my how can you really make money out of that

48
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,656
But this scam is pulling in

49
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,448
Hundreds of deals a week

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
They call it deals

51
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
Each call is a deal

52
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,592
The scammers are called agents

53
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,432
And this operation like all businesses needs and IT guy

54
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,992
Felipe is hearing this and he's horrified

55
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
First that this is a business

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,576
Second that is relative is involved

57
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,136
But Philippe keeps a poker face

58
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:40,768
I immediately told him that this is not something that I can just decide right there and then

59
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
But that I will think about it

60
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,448
Philippic goes home any Google the phone number for the FBI

61
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,496
They tell him that's not our jurisdiction

62
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
You should call up the US Embassy in Costa Rica

63
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,640
I called them and they asked me to come in for a meeting

64
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,176
Which I did

65
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,040
And if it's like the movies do they meet you in a in a room with you know the blinds closed

66
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,624
It was just a conference room and in a US Embassy

67
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
In this conference room

68
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Explains his plan

69
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
He wants to take the job

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,632
Collect information that the US authorities might use like the names of the scammers in their location

71
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:24,032
Make some license plates. I am about to take this job and I want to stop this stuff from happen

72
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,360
I want you to know what I'm doing so you don't think I'm one of the bad guys

73
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:32,736
But pretty much just sounded us to hear that Joe Sealy was a US Postal Inspector

74
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
He's not retired

75
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
But in 2010

76
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,344
He was investigating mail fraud

77
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,928
Specifically telemarketing scams in Costa Rica

78
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
And weirdly the hard thing about Prosecuting these cases

79
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
Was not finding the bad guys

80
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,352
It was finding the victims

81
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,912
Because it was just so embarrassing so ashamed

82
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,216
The victims didn't come forward

83
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,776
Because I felt so ashamed about falling for the

84
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,408
And so for Joe Huey it's kind of the reverse of the typical investigators problem

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,456
Instead of having the dead body

86
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
Try to figure out who the bad guy is

87
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
He knows the bad guy

88
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,344
She has to track down enough victims

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
To make the arrest

90
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,512
We needed a lot of it cuz lot of credible victims and lots of losses without lots of it comes in lots of losses

91
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
We couldn't bring cases

92
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Joe Healy

93
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:25,727
Is sitting this conference room with Felipe the IT guy in his button up shirt liquid little guy he's 550

94
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
For not not overly

95
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Muscular

96
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:33,407
He's trying to explain to him this isn't some quick job where you grab some license plate numbers and addresses

97
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
He would need the names of the victims

98
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
And Philippe

99
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
Is considering doing it

100
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,367
Heading into the criminals Den to get that information to himself

101
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,975
We said okay are we can't guarantee your safety because we can't be there

102
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,839
I know so is long as you're going into with open eyes yes or no

103
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
Data will help us

104
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
When Philippe with a kid

105
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
He never imagined himself in it

106
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
He thought he be a cop

107
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
Like his grandfather

108
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,335
A police chief in San Jose

109
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:07,967
Felipe remembers watching his grandfather on the local news when he solved a big case

110
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
I remember him

111
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,295
Yolanda and the

112
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,599
And the police headquarters

113
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
The way everybody looked at him

114
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
And

115
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
I grew up admiring

116
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,255
His sense of Duty

117
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,815
Felipe's grandfather used to tell him that

118
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,399
Seeing something wrong being done and not doing anything about it

119
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
It makes you their accomplice

120
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,263
Philippe thought about what he done with his wife

121
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
He just turned 30

122
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
I was out of work in this just fell on my lap

123
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
But yeah I mean

124
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,479
How many people can say that they put out

125
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
Bunch of bad guys in jail

126
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
At least

127
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,927
How many it guys can say that after the break

128
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,999

And then

Pictures going to work

148
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
An office everyday

149
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:10,335
Picture wall to wall carpeting agents of cubicles working the phones the reading from a script that is pasted on each day

Desk

Behind the agents are more senior group they're called loaders

Will take over when the victim Falls for an agent's line

153
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
So

The next day the loader my call and say we didn't realize there's this other state tax

155

They could start threatening you

157
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
Here's one of the scammers

158
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
Want to do that

159
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,823
In this process

Until the victim had nothing left

163
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,319
There was this time a victim

164
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
Called

165
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,719
And she had already lost about $60,000

166
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
And she

167
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,815
She was crying she was crying saying

168
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,375
I have to go to Salvation Army to get food

169
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935

They actually put it on speaker

173
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
And they started laughing

174
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
Felipe is watching them laugh at her

175
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,759
And he's trying to control the expression on his own face

176
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,575
You hear the voices you hear her crying and

177
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,159
He immediately started trying to imagine what she looks like

178
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,743
What is she going to do after she hangs up

179
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Phone

180
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327

184
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,007
Are they going to yell at her

185
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,055
She gave all this money away

186
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
It's

187
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,431
I guess I just put myself in her shoes

188
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
And I

189
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,855
That was sort of a turning point

190
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
And

191
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,415
Uprising happen

192
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
I really

193
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
Made it personal after that

194
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:09,119
I I I wanted those guys in jail whenever I felt like not going

195
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
Whenever I felt like just quitting

196
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
I just

197
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
I remember

198
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
That laughter

199
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
It was part of a strategy

200
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
Scammers often use

201
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Dehumanize the victim

202
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,943
Even the word the con artists use for Vicks

203
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
The mark

204
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
It's dehumanizing

205
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
Another these strategies was drugs

206
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,135
There's lots of weed people doing coke in the break room

207
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,791
But there was one person in the office who seem to need no substance could do this scam totally open

208
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
I'd and sober

209
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,607
And that was the owner

210
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
Emilio Jose Torres

211
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,007
If it's one of those movies with a good-looking hero in a better-looking villain

212
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
Emilio is that feeling

213
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,103
Scott long dark hair a surfer to business suit

214
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,687
He works with a guy named Max was wanted for murder in the US

215
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,271
Emilio had been on the radar for us authorities for years

216
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
Joe Healy the Postal Inspector

217
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,391
Tell me this one very surprising thing about it

218
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,951
He was a really good boss

219
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,743
To expect it to show up on time

220
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,095
You are expected to do the workload that he gave you for the day

221
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
You were accountable for what you did

222
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Hand

223
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
He was fair

224
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,823
I find it funny used to work there when you talk about criminals but he was fair with his people

225
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,663
Philippe Petit really known anything about Emilio when he started working there

226
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,503
But I found out that Emilio was all about business

227
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,855
One of the first things Emilio ask me is what do you think we need

228
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
To make this more efficient

229
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:40,511
To make it more efficient with him he was all about productivity

230
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,327
Felipe realizes that he's not just the IT guy

231
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,423
He's also the only one here with actual business experience

232
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,287
He worked at Hewlett-Packard this giant multinational corporation and

233
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
This is his chance

234
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,663
The IT guy can get the arch-villain to trust

235
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,015
I told him we have to rewire all the phones we have a lot of interruptions

236
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
You notice all these problems

237
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,207
Voice over IP using this regular interface agent got a lead

238
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,863
Have to run upstairs the one computer in the manager's office to look up the closest Western Union they have to start

239
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
Looking where the person lives and

240
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
Philippe Chows Emilio

241
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
We can do better than this

242
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,055
Every agent should have their own laptop

243
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,615
That's how we would have done it at Hewlett-Packard

244
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
Animalia hears that and he is hooked

245
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,479
They buy a bunch of laptops

246
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,551
That will let Felipe actually record the scammer that work

247
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,367
But it also makes the scam more efficient

248
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,255
Felipe Riggs it so that the laptop will feed the scripts and what are called rebuttals

249
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
What to say

250
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
In case

251
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Invicta mask

252
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
The question

253
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
And

254
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
So he was very

255
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
He was very happy with me

256
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
And

257
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
They used to call me filthy

258
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,615
Like filthy good at computers filthy good at

259
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,199
Improving the scam that was my nickname up Authority office

260
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
Filthy wasn't just a nickname

261
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
It was kind of an alter ego

262
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
The Phillippe adopted

263
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
Filthy will tell the dirtiest jokes

264
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
Filthy

265
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
Was also a Satanist

266
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,511
And filthy was also differential

267
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:22,143
I wouldn't make any eye contact I wanted them to think that I was very nerdy

268
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
Are you nerdy a little bit

269
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
I am I mean I am

270
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
I I work an it

271
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,615
And filthy was always faithful

272
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,199
To his new boss Emilio I was sort of Brownells in him

273
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
All the time

274
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Eunos like

275
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
Man you're so young you're done

276
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Like

277
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
Like all this stuff

278
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
So

279
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,415
How long did it take you to really gain Amelia's Trust

280
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
That's fast work

281
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Yeah

282
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,071
He remembers one time Amelia had to run an errand

283
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
Any turn to Felipe and said

284
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
Hey filthy watch the floor for me

285
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Yeah

286
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
Watch the guys

287
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,287
You know I make sure they don't do anything you're not supposed to

288
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
And

289
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
I remember

290
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,919
Arrow. They knew I had them

291
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
Beth Lipe or filthy

292
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,807
Still doesn't have the essential thing that he came here to get

293
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
After the break

294
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
Felipe tries to get

295
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
The names of the victor

296
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:22,559

It has already been uneventful summer in politics

302
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,463
Lipizzans Battle of emigration there's a lot going on when there's news you need to know about the NPR politics podcast

303
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:55,839
Is there to tell you what happened not to mention we're hitting the road so you can meet all of the 2020 contender

304
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:01,215
OIP was going to drive me completely crazy the NPR politics podcast

305
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,359
There is a list that has the names of the victims but Emilio has that list

306
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
He had it in a flashdrive

307
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,319
All the victims in in the Excel sheets and everything then one day Felipe sees the flash drive on

308
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
Guarded and he just grabs it

309
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,207
But he knows that they're searching the employees when they leave the office

310
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
And sleep is worried

311
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
He's going to get caught

312
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
With this flash drive

313
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,911
So I took a piece of gum and I stuck it to Amelia's backpack

314
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
Guess I knew that he wouldn't get searched

315
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
When we all left

316
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
They get outside

317
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
He tells Emilio

318
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
Is that what happened I call you back looks open

319
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,527
And I pretended to closing I just took this flashback back

320
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,135
This story like so many of Felipe story to seem totally Wild

321
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,951
I don't have a way to confirm it or fact check it

322
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,767
But I can't say the joke you leave the Postal Inspector

323
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
He confirmed many of Felipe stories

324
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,143
And he did say that one day

325
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,471
Philippe handed over to us agents a flash drive

326
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
Full of victims names

327
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,895
Jokingly starts calling those victims hearing story after Story of people losing all their money

328
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
He realizes this is

329
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,991
Huge scam millions and millions of dollars

330
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
What is one more problem

331
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
Emilio is a Costa Rican citizen

332
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,695
The Americans can't prosecute him as long as he stays in Costa Rica

333
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
It's a Felipe

334
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
Keeps working

335
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
Keeps being the office it guy

336
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
Is there trying to figure out

337
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,167
How is it going to get Emilio to leave the country

338
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,775
It is getting harder to go to work each morning it was just

339
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Triad

340
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
Other agent start asking him how come he doesn't get on the phone and I'm making any deals Felipe stops being able to sleep

341
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
The front of his hair falls out

342
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,551
Isn't have anyone you can talk to about this

343
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,367
I really need it to get out of San Jose

344
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
One weekend just

345
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Take a break

346
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,743
He goes to his grandfather's house on the beach

347
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
Dispense

348
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,863
A really nice Saturday swimming and playing checkers with grandfather

349
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
It was nice

350
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
Until he gets a call

351
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Familia

352
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
And

353
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
He called me on

354
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
Sunday

355
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
And he said that

356
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,431
This Linux server has crashed

357
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
And

358
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
Linux servers

359
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,063
Don't just crash

360
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Piano

361
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,903
It's very hard for that to happen

362
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,023
So you knew it was a setup because he said the Linux server crash and I was something only a non it person would say

363
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Yeah

364
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,703
I asked him what what's what's going on is is I know just crashed you scratch is not working like you nowhere

365
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
Turn off the phone song

366
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,591
He insisted you know now I need you to come back today cuz

367
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
You know I need the phone's working on Monday

368
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
Oh wow

369
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,735
You know first of all what is he doing there on a Sunday

370
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
And

371
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
I was really scared

372
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
And

373
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
I was at my grandfather's house

374
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
The weather happy nipples cheap

375
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,047
And I was the first time I told someone

376
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
I told him like

377
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Listen

378
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
I'm doing this

379
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
He was very proud

380
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
He was very very proud

381
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
And I guess because he knew that he was

382
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
It was because of him

383
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,175
And I told him like I've been doing this for a while

384
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,759
I I think they found out about it and they want to kill me

385
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,575
So we went through everything

386
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,159
And maybe says well you know us

387
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
Ask grandfather I don't want you to go

388
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
Do you have to make your own decisions

389
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
So I want

390
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
And

391
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
At this big knife

392
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
13 in the back of my pants

393
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
In

394
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
It was a 4-Hour Drive

395
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
And

396
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
I

397
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,431
I remember the whole time I was just so nervous

398
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,015
What's going to happen you know in

399
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,623
2 hours into it I kind of came to terms with it

400
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Casa del Rey

401
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,951
If I eat this is the way I go I go

402
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
This is the way I go this is where I go

403
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
You know and

404
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,375
I got to the office and the server has crashed

405
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
Pacific

406
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,751
The only thing left to do

407
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
Be an IT guy

408
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,871
Philippe bends over to see what's wrong with the server

409
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,431
And Emilio spots the knife

410
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
And a

411
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,527
Emily is like filthy why you have that big ass knife

412
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
Some like you call me on a Sunday

413
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,415
Telling me that the server crashed

414
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
And this Derek crashes

415
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,023
Like I thought that maybe somebody was holding you up or something

416
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
And

417
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:47,167
Oh you bought a big knife I'm like well you know you got to do what you got to do

418
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,215
And

419
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
I fix the server and I left

420
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
And yeah

421
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,895
That's the one time I've seen a Linux server crashed

422
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
That day

423
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
Philippe Kahn the con man

424
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,783
Which is what he was trying to do the whole time

425
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
And con artist

426
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
To get into the minds of their victims

427
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,695
They understand the stories that we tell ourselves about ourselves

428
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,999
And they give version back to us

429
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
You think you're generous

430
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327
The comment will help you help others

431
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
I think your Thrifty

432
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,399
The comment has a deal for you

433
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
In this way

434
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,007
Felipe played into Emilio's fantasy of himself

435
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
And first last Khan

436
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
He told him

437
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,127
You know what a successful businessman like you needs

438
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,407
Condo

439
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
In Miami

440
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:37,087
You should get an apartment in Brickell Avenue that place is gorgeous like why would you have all this money if you can really

441
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Suspended

442
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Emilio

443
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
Never had a chance

444
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
Corsi bought the condo

445
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,999
He flew to Miami and

446
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Of course

447
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,327
Got arrested the minute he stepped off the plane

448
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,143
Emilio's prosecuted convicted

449
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,703
Answered 7 years in federal prison

450
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
After Emilio's arrest

451
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,591
People start suspecting that Felipe it help the US authorities

452
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
He started getting death threats

453
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
So

454
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,479
Is friends at the US Embassy Ghana Visa

455
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,783
And got him to the states

456
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Where

457
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
He works in it

458
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
I'm curious

459
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,719
Playing the role of the comment even though you were doing it for good

460
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,535
You weren't trying to make money you're trying to catch the bad guys

461
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,143
They playing that role make it harder

462
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
2

463
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,495
Be in society and trust people

464
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
And do normal

465
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
Trusting things in life

466
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Well

467
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,735
I guess I read people more now

468
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:42,879
I immediately dissect everything they say and how they say it and their body language

469
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,439
And it changes you

470
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,767
Also in the way you don't see the world the same way

471
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:55,167
I literally feel bad when I see a senior citizen pushing carts in in supermarket

472
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
Or senior citizen working

473
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
You know I think

474
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,543
They could have been a victim

475
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,359
Now when Philippe just lives his life

476
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,895
Are goes out in the world

477
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
He can't help but think

478
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
Everything can be a con

479
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
And everybody can be a mark

480
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:22,048
