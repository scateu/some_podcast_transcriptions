1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,328
It's the season of giving thanks

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:06,144
And sharing embarrassing stories with your fam

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,680
In the spirit of that

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,496
A few days ago I called up my brother Joel

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,824
Now can you explain how in the world this all happened in the

6
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:20,224
How I ended up getting arrested

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,528
Was driving

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,552
To your house

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
For Thanksgiving and as usual I was on time

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
So I was speeding

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
So they could be more on time

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,512
And as I was

13
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,536
Speeding along

14
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,352
I saw police lights behind me so I pulled over

15
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
Engino normally the

16
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,984
This is like a five-minute thing they look at my license maybe I get a warning maybe a ticket

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:46,336
This time will this is a very well-known

18
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
Speed trap

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,152
Yeah I got pulled over

20
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
And he

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,528
Ask me to step out of the car and then he put me in handcuffs and put me in the cop car

22
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
Really

23
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,600
Anthony what's happening in

24
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,368
I want ask

25
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:03,488
So many questions but then the cop starts to tell me that I have the right to remain silent

26
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,280
And so I do

27
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,816
And then the cop drove me

28
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
Jail

29
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,376
Retook my mugshot

30
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
To the right

31
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,424
Face the camera

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
And they booked

33
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,776
Just felt so silly

34
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,592
You need to get arrested for

35
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
Gettington

36
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,384
Yeah

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,408
I mean

38
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,480
Han if you also got a speeding ticket a few years

39
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,760
Earlier and

40
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,296
Forgot to pay it before leaving

41
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
Town

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,832
And then you

43
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
Speed again

44
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,440
Through the same small town on a holiday

45
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,536
But I think the thing that made me the most nervous was that you or the one I had to call

46
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,328
Cuz you were my one phone call

47
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
From jail

48
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,448
You you felt like you would let your going to be letting me down or something

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,008
Well you're quite responsible

50
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,568
And you have children

51
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,848
That I like

52
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
Quite a bit

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,968
There was a brief moment of evaluation on we decided

54
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,296
Can we allow a convicted

55
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
Traffic

56
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,904
Violator to come to our house for Thanksgiving dinner

57
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,256
Did you spend the night in jail I did not Leslie I build myself out a couple hours later and

58
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,304
My brother did save me some turkey

59
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
And of course they all thought that it was

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
So funny witch

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
Does did start out as

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,240
Just kind of a funny family story but then

63
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
It turned into something else in

64
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
Entirely because

65
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,616
There is something that came after the arrest

66
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,200
Something to introduce me to a world that I did not know exist

67
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
That would follow me

68
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
Much longer than the other

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Okay

70
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
About six months later

71
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,368
I get a phone call from my niece

72
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
And she tells me that

73
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,232
She's been online and for some reason she was Googling my name

74
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,536
And the first thing that came up

75
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
Was my mugshot

76
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
So one of the kids

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,936
Are you the one that found my mugshot online and they

78
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,568
They used it as the picture that came up when I called them

79
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
That's funny

80
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
You're telling me that

81
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,456
If I right now Google

82
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,784
Karen I'm doing it because I send

83
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
Mugshots

84
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
That's not you

85
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
There's a lot of mugshots here but

86
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
Weather today

87
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Not mine

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,608
Not so far okay well I can tell you why that is because

89
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
As I discovered

90
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:24,288
The entire business model of the website where my photo ended up mugshots.com

91
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Is it they say look

92
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
Will take down your mugshot

93
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
If you pay us a fee

94
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
I know right

95
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,248
If they charged me $399

96
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,320
To take down my mugshot and judging by the fact that I'm already on page

97
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
It's two of this

98
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
And

99
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,440
I don't see it yeah it better

100
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,744
I felt like I had

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,096
To pay this especially because I just left like this corporate career that

102
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,888
Stable behind me and I was

103
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,216
Tried to start over in radio so I knew that editors would

104
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Be Googling my name

105
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,128
Having a mugshot come up first did not seem like it was the best first impression

106
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
So I logged on

107
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,016
Entering my credit card number to pay this thing and I'm

108
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
Fuming and I'm thinking like

109
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,600
How is this legal

110
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,416
Denny's occurs to me I am a reporter now

111
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
I

112
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
I'm going to get to the bottom of this

113
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,679
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Karen Duffin

114
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,775
If you are one of the more than 70 million people in America have been arrested

115
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
Chances are

116
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
You have a mugshot

117
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
And thanks to the internet

118
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
That can follow you forever

119
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,039
Trying to stop mugshot extortion takes us to a place where the First Amendment and our right to privacy

120
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
Crash in Freely complicated way

121
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,391
Cuz when it comes to the Constitution

122
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
Compromise isn't easy

123
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,767
Today on the show I fulfill my promise to my former self

124
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
I am going to figure out

125
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,119
How online mugshots turned into a business

126
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,447
Hyatt legal and if we can stop it

127
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031

Fairies

144
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
Why do mugshots even

145
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Why is it

146
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,871
Picture of you on your worst day available

147
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,967
You kind of have to go back to way before the internet even is

148
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:44,831
Back before the founding of America back to our founding Grudge

149
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:51,231
Against the British because the Brits were arresting people secretly so the colonists were like that's not cool

150
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
And they started

151
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
Publishing their own list

152
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
Everest

153
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,911
Has like a check on power service and after we kick the Brits out

154
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
We passed laws so that

155
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
Now Americans get to know all kinds of things about what the government's doing we get access to a lot of government records

156
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Including mugshot

157
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,479
And the first mug shots were physical photographs that law enforcement would

158
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,271
Basically just collect in a book

159
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,879
And for really long time you had to go to the jail fill out a form

160
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
In order to see them so it took some effort to

161
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
To see a mugshot

162
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
And then the internet

163
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
Alright so now we don't have to go to jail again

164
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
A picture now we can just find on The Intern

165
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Exactly so

166
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,215
Police departments in jails they start putting a bunch of their information online

167
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,519
In part because there was this push to get

168
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,567
More information out to victims of crime

169
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
So you have more mugshots online

170
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,991
And then someone takes this beuno Noble Public accessing

171
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
And turns it into a

172
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
Huge

173
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
And the guy who's credited with doing that

174
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,183
Is an enterprising ex-con in Florida

175
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,999
That you're saying we have to blame Florida man as usual

176
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,815
And this particular Florida man is robbed Wicca

177
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,167
Robert served three years in prison and he was out and trying to get back on it

178
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Enneathought

179
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,031
What if I applied my computer programming skills

180
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
To Florida

181
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
Very liberal public

182
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615

Tokyo

184
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:19,295
It's downright the program that just scraped mugshots from law enforcement websites and posted them to his

185
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
Brand new website

186
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111

00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
Kindly let visitors

190
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
Tagged mugshots you can take them like

191
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Hottie or w

192
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
UTF

193
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
And he also kindly let people

194
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,655
For a small fee remove their mugshots

195
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
But that

196
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,751
The online mugshot industry was born

197
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,823
What used to require real effort

198
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,127
Like drive to a government office or mail in

199
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Quest weight

200
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,735
Is now just an idle curious Google search away

201
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,831
Yeah I used to work the graveyard shift at NPR reading the news and I would come across

202
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
So many of

203
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,159
Things are more like articles

204
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:01,023
Of people making fun of people who are in mugshots and I remember some of these sites names

205
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
Georgia busted

206
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
Spring break mug

207
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
Gotcha mugshots

208
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
Also

209
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
A lot of newspaper

210
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:12,031
Fight like the Tampa Bay Times about 5% of their overall site traffic is

211
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
Is to their mugshot page

212
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
There's like this online

213
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
Ecosystem around

214
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
People's worst Moana

215
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:23,039
Millions of people's worst moment cuz millions of people get arrested every year

216
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:29,695
In fact if you took all the arrestees in America right now and made them into their own country it would be bigger than

217
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
And if

218
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,279
All the arrestees where to stay

219
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
Hold hands

220
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
They could circle the Earth

221
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Free time

222
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,679
Okay I guess that you're very into spatial metaphors right now

223
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:45,311
I also know because I said near you in the office that you have been calling up a lot of people

224
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
Quip dealt with issues

225
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
Because they're mugshots

226
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,223
Right yeah I wanted to get a sense for what the experience is like

227
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
For other people

228
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,831
Because you know my arrest is now just kind of a funny family story

229
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,903
Which can happen when you're a middle-class white girl

230
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
But for a lot of people I talked

231
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
The thing that change their lives

232
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
As much as the arrest

233
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
If not more

234
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,119
With the fact that their arrest would now tag along with them on

235
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
Dates

236
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
Job interviews

237
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
Housing applications

238
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Forever

239
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
Even though a mugshot

240
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
Is often misleading

241
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,383
I talked to Sarah lageson she's a sociologist from Rutgers who study says

242
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,711
A mugshot doesn't tell us much about the person who's arrested

243
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,247
It tells us a lot about

244
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
Who the police decided to arrest

245
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,647
A huge chunk of people who are arrested are never charged or

246
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,463
In California in 2011

247
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,767
Actually the majority of people arrest

248
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
No charge no conviction

249
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,911
And the chances of getting arrested are of course much higher for some

250
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:48,031
Some people you are 16% more likely to get arrested if your a Hispanic man

251
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,359
And 29% more likely if you're a black man

252
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
And if we

253
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,455
You have some trouble with the systemic and

254
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:02,111
And structure problems with who gets arrested we should also have problem taking the mugshot says there's an indicator of who

255
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Who is dangerous

256
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
They can make it harder to get

257
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
Job because

258
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,767
More than 75% of employers say that they Google every

259
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Candidate end

260
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
If they see your mugshot they can just

261
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,631
Eliminate you right away without even interview

262
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,447
And just so you know these people just aren't qualified for the job

263
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,103
And as the applicant there's no way for you to challenge that you don't really know what's going on people I talked to told me that these mugshots

264
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
It harder to date

265
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:29,247
Sarah also says that people will cut way back on what she calls pro-social

266
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,063
They might stop volunteering at schools

267
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
Because that there's a background check

268
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,415
Thing there and of course you're in the small community where

269
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
People talking gossip

270
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
The last thing you want is for your kids half

271
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,303
To deal with it and then you take the worst

272
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
Case scenario the wrongfully convicted

273
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,423
People like Jacques Rivera in Chicago

274
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,751
He served 21 years for a murder he did not commit

275
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
But he's online mugshots still LinkedIn

276
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
To this murder even said he should

277
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
It's still be in jail

278
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,735
You talk to the Chicago Tribune about what it meant that his mugshot was on Mugshots

279
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,063
Profile salon

280
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
How to charge a murder you know

281
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
And Isis

282
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,743
The scary

283
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,791
That's all it takes is one person and

284
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
To change my life forever

285
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,911
Just like the wrongful convictions insult

286
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,007
But to be clear jock could pay the extortionary fee to the website

287
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:29,407
Side right he could but that is probably not going to solve the problem because it just keeps popping up on other side

288
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,503
It's like after I paid mugshots.com mine popped up on another site

289
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
To pay them

290
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,343
For lots of people it can end up on like a dozen

291
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
Okay what

292
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,927
Brings us to our second question

293
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
How is this even legal

294
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
As I looked into this

295
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
I discovered that it's

296
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,839
Actually kind of our fault

297
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,399
My fault soap reporters are the biggest

298
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,959
Cheerleaders for access to online mugshots

299
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
Cut up a lawyer named Adam Marshall

300
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:02,175
He is a litigator for the reporters committee for the freedom of the press

301
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
And I was trying to get some government

302
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
Okay so how does Adam defend

303
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
Your mugshot DUI mugshots

304
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,391
Adams job is to fight for access to government.

305
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
Documents like as many as we can get soap

306
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,999
He is a purist on this topic

307
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
He thinks mugshot access

308
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Should be absolute

309
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,119
It's hard for us to predict

310
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
Like when

311
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
That openness is going to be really important

312
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
When is it going to be

313
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,543
The case of mistaken identity when is it going to be

314
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,615
Theodore St who's beating up by the cops

315
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,919
Okay but there has to be some

316
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
Reasonable way to

317
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Handle this

318
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,295
An atom's mind it's a hard thing to

319
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
To do because you can't say it like

320
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,183
We're going to cut off access to this information because people are using that information

321
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Poorly

322
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
McCaffrey

323
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
Start saying

324
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,559
Oh you can only you know have

325
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Access to government information

326
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,143
If you use it in a good way

327
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
That's like a really

328
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
Dangerous road I think

329
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
To go down

330
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,567
What's important is that we deal with

331
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,127
People who are trying to again

332
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Extort

333
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
Or abused

334
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
People

335
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
I think that's what

336
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,575
The way the Constitution protects ideas like the freedom of

337
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,927
The Press is to protect some extra stuff to stuff we don't necessarily like

338
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
So it can feel scary to Copper

339
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,791
How to say yes yes public records

340
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
We need them

341
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
But

342
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,191
The internet is weaponized some of them so for those records you need a permission

343
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
We're almost there we are almost

344
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
At the end of your quest

345
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
To avenge

346
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,359
Your former mugshot itself

347
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
And our final question is

348
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
Is it possible to stop these sites

349
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
There are people who are trying

350
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,295
18 states have passed laws

351
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,367
Then make it illegal for a website to charge you to

352
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
Take your mugshot off of their say

353
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:54,047
The problem is those are really hard to leverage this is Sarah lageson again this sociologist from Rutgers

354
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
The last don't have a lot of teeth

355
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
There's jurisdictional confusion

356
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
If the server's in Belize

357
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
The website operators in Florida

358
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,287
Play where do I begin right what court do I even go to to file this

359
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,615
Also some of the penalties are really low

360
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,455
And states that have these laws most of them don't even enforce them

361
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
Which leaves it mostly to citizens

362
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Cystocele

363
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,087
Leaving aside how expensive that would be

364
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,415
These are the last citizens who would want to engage with

365
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
I've asked people.

366
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:29,119
Sue them ever thought about taking legal action and they look at me like I'm crazy anything why would I ever go re-enter courtroom

367
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,191
People who sued have found their mugshots

368
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,239
Suddenly multiplied across the internet

369
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
So some people get created

370
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,383
If they try to just do what they can to move their mug shot down in the Google

371
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
Like this one guy that Sarah enter

372
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
He created all these online profiles of the

373
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,623
This person last name he started blogging about the TV show Arrested Development

374
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
IC

375
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Why

376
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
You assigned yourself

377
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
You want it so that when people

378
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,375
Google Karen Duffin mugshot that comes over the Planet Money episode not your mugshot

379
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
That's what you said

380
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
All jokes aside Google can fix

381
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
What they have been trying

382
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,335
A few years ago people started saying like why doesn't Google just cut this off

383
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:16,735
In response Google made this claim that they were going to change the algorithm and that they were going to make sure that these

384
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:23,647
Mugshots weren't showing up right away I talk to Google and they told me yes they have been working on this for years now

385
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,463
Sarah seems to think it actually kind of back

386
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
In reality what they did was it

387
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,351
Taught all the website operators how to optimize

388
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,911
Their websites for Google search results cuz

389
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
They no longer it's going to be

390
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
Passively happening

391
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:44,127
They needed to figure out how to make sure that their website they're showing up right away so they actually can experts message response

392
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
If they got a vaccine

393
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,735
And now that it made them stronger

394
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
Google told me

395
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
They promised they are

396
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
We're still trying to

397
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
I'm not going to say

398
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
You're

399
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Disappointing

400
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
Your former self

401
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,535
You told your former self that you were going to find Solutions

402
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,095
In the show have you found any actual

403
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
The solution that some people have found is

404
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
Just go back to the system that we had

405
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Before the

406
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,311
Just still let people get mugshots

407
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
But just not make it automatic

408
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
Like the fat

409
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
For a long time

410
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Federal mugshots

411
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
We're pretty easy to get

412
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
2 years ago

413
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
The court said

414
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,111
I think the internet's turned mugshots into something that they were never meant

415
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,463
So now you can only get Federal mugshots

416
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
If you do it the old-fashioned way

417
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
You have to make a request

418
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Sherpas

419
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
Federal arrest

420
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Tiny frog

421
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
That is

422
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,727
That is true so I also looked around to see

423
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
If anyone's trying to solve this at a

424
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,799
State or local level

425
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,407
And I found this guy Mitch Lucas he is the assistant sheriff in

426
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
Charleston South Carolina

427
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:56,319
And he told me that when he heard about what mugshots.com and other sites were doing

428
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,343
He was Furious

429
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
Call it despicable

430
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
Respect was the only

431
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
The only one I can think of

432
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Scribe

433
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
All the people

434
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
So

435
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
Wait wait

436
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
Decided to do what we could

437
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
2

438
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
Make it more.

439
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,495
The way he made it more difficult

440
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
Call for them

441
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,079
Is bite turning to his it guys

442
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
And saying

443
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,687
Stop letting these sites automatically slurp up are mugshots

444
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
Stop the robot

445
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
The robo

446
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
Protractor

447
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
I want photo that

448
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:36,511
Refuge 11.1 it's impossible to erase what is already out there but

449
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
They can put up a gate

450
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
To getting new mugshot

451
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
And what they did is Kai

452
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Kind of technical but

453
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,983
Basically they wrote software that makes it impossible for websites

454
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
Pick up their mugshots

455
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
Kinfolk gota work

456
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
It did actually

457
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,639
If you go to mugshots.com and you search on Charleston

458
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,199
Most of the entries that come up don't have pictures

459
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,015
So you're saying our Collective faith

460
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
Is in the hands

461
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,087
Of local

462
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
Yes this is a solution

463
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
But it

464
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Would require thousands

465
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Civ counties

466
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
I'm guessing that the odds of that are

467
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Pretty low

468
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
So I

469
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,911
Did come up with one more solution that I ran by Captain with

470
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
I have a proposal

471
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
I think that everyone

472
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:24,639
In the country has to take an unflattering photograph of themselves and post it online with

473
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
With the worst thing they ever did

474
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,247
And then we're all leave it but it's fine

475
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,391
I'm sure you'll have people jumping at the chance to participate

476
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,791
I don't know how to figure out how to spell it

477
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351
