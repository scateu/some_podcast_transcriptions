00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,816
Today we have a story about how you can dis man

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,352
Federal agency

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,120
From the inside

4
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:08,192
Any agency in question is the one that protects

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,472
Everyday Americans

6
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,752
It's from big bang

7
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,800
Lenders financial institutions

8
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:16,128
It's called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,152
The cfpb

10
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,992
Cfpb agency is a sort of Rorschach test

11
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,040
For how you view the role of government

12
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:23,808
In your life

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,624
Democrats they love the cfpb

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,488
You screwed up the financial crisis and to them it is an independent Watchdog that works

15
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,280
Pick the little guy from Bank fees and

16
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560
Deceptive loans

17
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,328
And high interest rate

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,376
For republicans

19
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,912
It's a little different

20
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,936
What's your from

21
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,752
This Bureau is unlike any other Federal bureaucracy

22
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,080
It's run by one person has no accountability to Congress

23
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,664
It is perhaps the most unaccountable Bureau agency there is

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
We want to run that place

25
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,760
With a good deal of humility and prunes

26
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,600
That is Mick Mulvaney is a former Republican congressman

27
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,136
South Carolina

28
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,208
When he was in Congress he actually sponsored a bill

29
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,000
To destroy the cfp

30
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
BB completely

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,864
The bill failed but the Republican dream of killing the agency live.

32
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,168
In fact when Donald Trump was elected president

33
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,984
And you got a chance to name a new director of the

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
Cfpb

35
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,568
He looked around and he picked the man

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,384
Who probably hated the agency the most

37
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664
The guy we just heard from

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
Mick Mulvaney

39
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
Of course

40
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
Consumer group

41
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
Crazy

42
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
Freaking out and it was just so odd

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,112
That when Mulvaney everything topper

44
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
Introduced himself

45
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
Pediatricians office

46
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,024
Despite what you might by the way thank you for having me despite what you might read

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
I'm pretty sure I'm not the devil

48
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,144
At least of my wife and my mother don't think that I am

49
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,216
What happens when you put the person

50
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,752
Who tried to murder an agency

51
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,800
In charge of that agency

52
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
We have not blowing the place up we've not set the building on fire detective you ever seen the building it's not possible to set it on fire

53
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
It's a brutalist architecture building with nothing flammable in it we have changed it though

54
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
Mick Mulvaney decided if he was going to have to do it one small piece at a time

55
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
Hello and welcome to Planet Money on croissants and I'm Robert Smith today on the show we will follow one man

56
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:21,056
The cfpb and one single enforcement case brought by the agency

57
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,640
The case is an investigation of an online loan shark

58
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:29,760
A lender charging outrageous levels of interested people who clearly could not afford

59
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,344
The kind of case of cfpb was designed to go after

60
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,696
But then Along Came Mick Mulvaney who decided he wanted to do things a little differently

61
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
Will show you what happen

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,984

74
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Did the cfpb is

75
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
1 case against

00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
One length

77
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,664
I think some question is the cfpb versus Golden Valley Lending

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Ink

79
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,528

Seems very straightforward

00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
That's what Julie bone-in fat.

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
I was

92
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,480
Literally facing eviction cuz I was so behind on my rent and I had no idea where I was

93
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
Money

94
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,808

00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
Year

98
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
Boyfriend broke up their car got

99
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Stolen

100
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
Angie got behind the red

101
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:26,239
It was living alone paying right by herself as she clicked around on this Golden Valley website finally just desperate for money

102
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,799
The way it was presented was literally presented as like

103
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
For large payments

104
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
I love you.

105
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
She makes the pain

106
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
And she thinks

107
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
She's home free

108
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,295
But then the lender kept taking money out of her checking account

109
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Sochi

110
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,135
Contacted Golden Valley and said what is up

111
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,463
This and they said oh no you agreed

112
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
Online

113
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
To make a lot more pain

114
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
Nancy was all there in the fine print

115
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
Julie said she just absolutely didn't

116
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
Realize that

117
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
A10

118
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,727
Get this she showed me her account on the Golden Valley website

119
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,799
And it says for her $900 loan

120
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
Her payments are going to be

121
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
3700

122
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
35 bucks

123
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175

124
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455

00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
Transcribe

126
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
Obviously I didn't really want to

127
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
Tell anybody like

128
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,159
What had happened because it was so embarrassing and so

129
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
Shameful that I would have fallen for some

130
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Something like this

131
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,047
Finally Joy said she just didn't know what else to do so

132
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
She went to her boss at work

133
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
And at

134
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,679
He look at it and he was like us 100% interest

135
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
This is Criminal

136
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
Back in Washington DC

137
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,543
Lawyers at the cfpb we're coming to a similar

138
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
They begin a complaint

00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359

2017

143
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
They sue the company

144
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
Unfair deceptive

145
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
An abusive business

146
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,415
Christopher Peterson was an enforcement attorney at the cfpb you back when Obama was in office

147
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
And he seen a lot of you

148
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,535
Is predatory lending cases places this one stands out this

149
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
This lender

150
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
Was one of the worst of

151
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,631
They were making loans

152
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
With interest rates of 900

153
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
50%

154
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
To Consumers that could barely afford

155
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,823
To pay them back and we're struggling to make ends meet

156
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,663
And they were doing so in ways that were illegal and deceptive

157
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,783
That was going to investigate a company like this what would you like why were you first have to figure out

158
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,343
Who's behind the company how it how does it all work

159
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,439
The cfpb figured out that the call center for Golden Valley was in Overland Park

160
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
Kansas

161
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,303
And then we found out that one of the people Finance in the operation was a gentleman named

162
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
Richard Mosley

163
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,679
Who had been convicted of racketeering in another online Lending

164
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,751
Spreckels Crossing part of the whole investigation was

165
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,799
Who formerly owned

166
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
Golden Valley Lending

167
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,407
The companies registered in the Tiny Town of Upper Lake

168
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
California

169
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,991
The owners are an Indian tribe

170
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
It's called a heavy metal

171
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
Pomo of Upper Lake

172
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Indian tribe

173
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
We put on an interview requested

174
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,719
The tribe and we weren't hearing back from them first or

175
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Phone number weeks

176
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:00,095
Actually but we did have an address for Golden Valley lending it was listed in the cfp

177
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
If you lost it

178
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655

Upper Lake Calif

181
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,335
We gave this address to a radio producer we know janaki meta and said

182
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Go find it

183
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
Hey there

184
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,223

186
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,551
But it's it's it's much farther than

187
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
That right

188
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
Yeah it's like two and a half hours

189
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,183
Northeast of San Francisco

190
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,583
Pretty remote surrounded by mountains and lots of trees and the road kind of Narrows when you get close to the lake

191
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,983
Okay so I see a little town the right here this is Upper Lake

192
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:45,663
Upper Lake is this beautiful Town very green mountainous it's

193
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
God

194
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:52,831
Little houses spread out all over looks like a soap like one of those old towns out of country western

195
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:59,231
Turn films on the post office and Salon that looks like a used to say salut

196
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511
Luna

197
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,071
So I pulled up and

198
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,399
I saw these three people standing outside

199
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
John Krasinski

200
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
I'm Ray

201
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
REI

202
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
My name is hippy Joe

203
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
Of course

204
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,151
Yeah I had a big walrus mustache and sunglasses on sale

205
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,551
Can you describe where we are right now we're on Main Street at the corner

206
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
Are we have hippie Jose

207
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
Starting down there at the gas station

208
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,207
A doctor's office you have the fire

209
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,047
And I'm leaning on the horse type

210
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,631
You know this

211
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:44,031
It sounds like a nice place was there any sign of Golden Valley Lending

212
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
Annapolis

213
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
London Christmas

214
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,943
Like a lending business

215
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,015
I haven't heard of it

216
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
And you went to that address what what did you find

217
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,975
I found a

218
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
You know they're running Creek Casino I went inside walked up to

219
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
To the desk where there was this woman she appeared to be Native Americans like me don't ask her a couple of questions

220
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
She was

221
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,359
Immediately

222
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,967
Interested in kind of being interviewed but I did ask her about Golden Valley in

223
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,015
She did say she was part of the tribe

224
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,087
But she was totally unwilling to talk to me she said

225
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487
Golden Valley was indeed on the premises but she couldn't really say anymore and she kept telling me to talk to Sherry Trap by who

226
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,535
Is there a tribal official

227
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
And then

228
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,167
Yeah yeah when I tried to find it myself

229
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
I

230
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:51,615
Couldn't find signs anywhere I even I went outside and I drove around the building and this can cut off

231
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
Guard the subs

232
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
Security guard came from inside the building and

233
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
Decided I don't know what you're talking about all I know is it's not here you need to leave the premises so

234
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
I deleted that point

235
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,695
Alright well thanks for trying janaki

236
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
Robert

237
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,511
I'm still not sure that we have a good

238
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Sense

239
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
Exactly what's going on with this

240
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,655
Tribal lender there is some kind of operation there at that casino

241
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Yeah and the cfpb had a

242
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
A theory about the

243
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,031
Renuzit online lenders sometimes

244
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
Incorporate on Indian

245
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,383
And then claims they're not subject to

246
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
State laws

247
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
So even if state that says you

248
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
You can't charge High interest rates

249
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,295
A native American-owned company can claim hate that does not

250
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
Apply to us we have Tribal sovereignty

251
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,159
But in the lawsuit the cfpb says

252
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Look

253
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,487
Not really what we're not buying that Golden Valley

254
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
Is clearly acting

255
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
Is a national lender

256
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
Even if they have an address in a

257
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Casino

258
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
This remote area

259
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Upper Lake California

260
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,471
This was where the case stood

261
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
When Mick Mulvaney was named director

262
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Of the cfp

263
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,383
The Republican who did not believe that the agency should even exist

264
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Was now heading that eat

265
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
At one of his first Acts

266
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
Is the Senate memo

267
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
Tell the entire staff

268
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,623
Hey everybody we are going to do things a lot

269
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Slower

270
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Around here

271
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
So slow in

272
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
In fact it's some things

273
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
We're doing

274
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
We're no longer going to be doing

275
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
At all

276
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
And quietly

277
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
And mysterious

278
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
Around the same time

279
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
This Golden Valley lawsuit

280
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
Get straps

281
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,615
He wouldn't lawsuit that have been years in the mail

282
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
It's a company accused of fleecing

283
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,735
Perhaps thousands of people and all of a sudden this lawsuit is about

284
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
Yeah and at the time it seemed

285
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
A little strange cuz it didn't get a lot of

286
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Attention but

287
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
I started to hear

288
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
From people inside

289
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
The cfpb

290
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
And they were

291
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,839
Puzzled because this this case seems like a slam dunk it was like why all of a sudden

292
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,631
Is Golden Valley being let off

293
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,727
Can you call people inside of government agency they're not supposed to talk so

294
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
I found the sky Christopher Peterson

295
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,591
He's a former lawyer at the cfpb is now law professor

296
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
I asked him

297
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,455
So you know what what's your take on this lawsuit getting traps

298
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
These

299
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,295
Federal investigations can take years

300
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
To gather all the information to

301
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
Bring people who break the law to Justice

302
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:16,511
People are devastated and angry just imagine how you would feel if years of your life

303
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,327
Have been dedicated to pursuing Justice

304
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
And now that's all

305
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
Thrown in the trash and you lose everything

306
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
He says if the cfpb hadoop

307
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
Pursued and won the lawsuit

308
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,079
That could have clawed back money to help thousands of people have allegedly been hurt

309
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
People like Julie who really wasn't happy.

310
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
Did you hear that the lawsuit had been dropped

311
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,247
I'm really mad like really pissed because

312
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
Actually voting for Trump

313
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
So

314
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
I feel kind of like

315
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Stupid

316
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
It's kind of like

317
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Betrayed

318
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
I wanted to know

319
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
Who actually

320
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Betrayed you

321
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
Play so I started to make a few calls

322
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,375
And I figured well start at the top Mick Mulvaney

323
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
His price guide decline the interview

324
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
But

325
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,495
The Prescott told me something interesting

326
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
He said

327
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,847
This is not Mulvaney's doing it this decision was made by quote

328
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Professional career

329
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Staff

330
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
In other words

331
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
There's nothing to say

332
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
See here wasn't us

333
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
Just some lawyers

334
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Been here long

335
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,599
But that just seemed a little weird to me like

336
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
It just kind of felt like

337
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,671
He was lying because how could that

338
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,719
Be true until I reached out to some

339
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
The cfpb

340
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,887
And if it look I mean every single career staffer in this building

341
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
Wanted to push ahead with

342
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,983
With this case the only possible explanation

343
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Yes

344
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Did Mick Mulvaney dropped

345
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
Hey Chris you reported some of this

346
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
On NPR

347
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
And then

348
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
All hell broke loose

349
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,247
Looks at least one Senator heard the story and decided to ask

350
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
Mulvaney on the record

351
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,367
Did you personally kill this case against Golden Valley Lending

352
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
It was Democratic senator

353
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Chris Van Hollen

354
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
950%

355
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,047
Interest rates I mean this is higher than

356
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
Mafia loan sharks

357
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Simple question

358
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Were you part of the

359
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
The decision to drop

360
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
The case again

361
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Golden

362
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Yes sir

363
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
I'll follow up with

364
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
I think it's an outrageous

365
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:10,687
Mulvaney didn't say during his hearing why he wanted to drop the lawsuit against Golden Valley but we

366
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
Tried to get into his head

367
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,855
And we think it shows what he means by this Mantra that the agency should exercise more

368
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
Humility and moderation

369
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,487
Yep mulvania said over and over again that he thinks the cfpb hasn't

370
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,279
Push the envelope

371
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,607
That's going right up to the edge of its mandate with Congress

372
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,679
Being as aggressive as possible some as being too aggressive

373
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
Edwin Mulvaney was talking about his

374
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
Priorities for the sea

375
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
If you be steadwell

376
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:40,639
You don't look at the list of complaints that we get here just a small fraction of the

377
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
Complaints are about

378
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,783
You know payday lenders are high interest loans so maybe those should be a small part of our Enforcer

379
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,111
Right so that's maybe what Mulvaney is

380
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Banking

381
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
But

382
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
Some consumer advocate

383
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
It's a

384
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,999
There might be something else going on to

385
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
This is clear evidence that

386
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,119
Mick Mulvaney is a Payday industry puppet

387
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,191
Carl freshers with the consumer group Allied progress

388
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,751
He said if you look back over the last decade

389
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
You know as a congressman he took

390
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,615
$62,000 + from the payday lenders

391
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:17,759
And now at the cfpb he's doing their bidding of course as much as we would like to be inside Mick Mulvaney's head

392
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,343
We are knots and we asked him several times for interviews he's

393
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
Said no every time

394
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
So

395
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
We don't really know the motivation

396
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,767
But we do know that as of today

397
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
Golden Valley is free to keep

398
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Giving out

399
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,375
Money their website still up

400
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
And after many weeks of calls

401
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
We did manage

402
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
To get someone from the tribe

403
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
To speak with us

404
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
Coming up after

405
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
Support for this podcast

406
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
In the following message

407
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
Did you come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

More information is available at aecf. Org

411
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,999
A couple days ago I got on the phone with

412
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
A tribal official

413
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:07,423
My name is Sherry treppa I am the chairperson of the Hemet old poem of Upper Lake tribe and

414
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,983
Have been the chairperson since 2008

415
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,567
Sure trepasses lucky you have to see Golden Valley Lending

416
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
In context

417
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
As in

418
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
Hundreds of years

419
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,991
She says her tribe suffered the whole history book worth of ingest

420
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
Massacre in the 1800's

421
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
Worcester land of the 1900s

422
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
The try barely

423
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Survive

424
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:32,767
And it was only 15 years ago actually that the tribe started to pull itself back together again

425
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
We have a very very young government

426
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:40,703
The mission of our of our tribal government is to improve the lives of our peace

427
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Troy-Bilt

428
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
But it is

429
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
So remote in Upper Lake

430
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,847
Make it so far away from me big papa

431
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
Population centers

432
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
It doesn't make any

433
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:54,271
But then trepasses to try for the other tribes were starting make money with his online Landing fee

434
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
And he looked into it

435
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,879
And what happens sometimes instead of tribal disorder

436
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,719
Lone its name with some other company somewhere else in the country in the tribe with

437
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
Like a tiny slice the profit

438
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,327
That's but they're not really the letters it's called Reggie tribe

439
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
Trevor says they decided to go

440
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
In another Direction

441
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:16,543
And it turns out according to her that they're much more real owners of this thing especially at this point now

442
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,103
They're putting up a lot of the money and

443
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
They're making a lot more

444
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,759
I'm not going to share the balance sheet of our businesses but

445
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Budget

446
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,367
For the current year is

447
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
Isn't millions of dollars

448
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:37,279
And it has changed the oil change the lives

449
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
Of generations

450
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
Come

451
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
Millions of dollars

452
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
All from online

453
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
Lending

454
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:49,055
She said Somebody's paying for college scholarships eldercare cultural activities for the tribe

455
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,615
Which is all well and good but we did have

456
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
1 peking

457
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
Yunnan

458
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,759
Do you have to charge 850

459
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,319
80% interested I mean like like why not

460
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,135
Dual ending operation that is

461
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
You know where that is

462
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,255
That's not just so painful for

463
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,815
People who sell them I've talked to didn't

464
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
Understand what they were getting into

465
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
Sure

466
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:25,151
We provide a good product that is well related

467
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
But it is expensive

468
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,551
We do know that there is a population of the customers we serve

469
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,111
That don't have any intentions of paying it back

470
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:40,511
So the cost of the loan is reflective of the cost to underwrite the customer

471
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,071
Cost to service the customer

472
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,607
Cost to collect

473
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,679
And notably the cost of the default

474
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,799
It's an expensive product but it is an expensive product to deliver

475
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,591
The Chris I have to say

476
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
I would never take that one

477
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,175
I would not recommend anyone

478
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
But I am a little bit

479
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,527
Torn because I do know that

480
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,831
Tribes have very few

481
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
Ways to make money

482
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
On their tribal land

483
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
And they could do things like casinos or

484
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
Fireworks

485
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
Tax-free cigarettes

486
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
And as much

487
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,375
As I'm so disturbed by the online Lending

488
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
I can see if that's your only option

489
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
That you might go that way

490
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,751
There's a profound

491
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
Legal questions

492
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
Because all the things that you're talking about

493
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,639
Cigarettes a gaming operation that's all happening on

494
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,663
Tribal land

495
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
But here

496
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
These loans

497
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
900 percentage

498
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,527
Straight all the rest of it that's

499
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
Happening

500
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
Microsoft

501
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
Tribal land in the near vicinity were talking about

502
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
All acrostic

503
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,207
Country states where these loans are illegal

504
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,023
And whether or not that's okay

505
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
Had this lawsuit

506
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,607
Going forward that would have been decided in

507
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,423
In court with a judge we would have had a real ant

508
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
Answer to that question

509
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
Is that okay

510
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
But when you drop a lawsuit

511
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
Will never get the answer

512
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,151
Right and staffers at the bureau where they look this is one case

513
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
But

514
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
There are dozens more

515
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,503
Investigations cases

516
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:12,671
Regulations that are in the works at the bureau and the people been working on them are really concerned that nickel babies come in now

517
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,999
And they're worried is that this case the one we've been talking about

518
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Could be a blueprint

519
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,607
For throwing out lots of other important stuff that they're working on

520
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,807
If any of her listeners out there know somebody or themselves have been involved

521
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:46,207
