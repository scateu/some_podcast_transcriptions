Today's Show originally aired in 2014

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,120
Puritas

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,424
If you don't pay your credit card

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,472
The first thing you might get is an email

5
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,496
Hate

6
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,520
Just a reminder

7
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,288
You missed your pain

8
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,104
If you still don't pay you'll start getting phone call

9
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,896
Eventually make it a letter

10
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,456
Your bank might pass your dead off to a collection agency

11
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:23,552
Some guy in a cubicle start calling and interrupting your dinner night after night

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832
And then

13
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,368
If you still don't pay

14
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,416
There's one final stop for your

15
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,720
You might get a call from a guy like Jim

16
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:35,328
A guy who I met last week standing outside a boarded-up house in Buffalo New York

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,912
You and the rough part of the neighborhood but I want you to know you're safe

18
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:43,776
Appreciate I feel sick I feel like

19
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,312
You are right but this is

20
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,848
This is the hood man

21
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,640
You know I mean this this is Buffalo

22
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
Buffalo

23
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,736
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob Goldstein

24
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,832

Jimmy on this world and that's our show today

28
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,096
The story of this one guy who tried to make something of himself by getting into a what's really an ugly business

29
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:13,216
Also the story of this whole low-level semi-legal debt collection economy that

30
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
Sprung up in Buffalo

31
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,800
And even in a small way

32
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,080
It's the story of the last

33
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,128
20 or so years of global Finance

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,688

Chick you actually went to high school to meet you

45
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
Talk to me for years for this book

46
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,952
And you and I met up in Buffalo last weekend we went

47
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,584
How you doing

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,144
Jimmy the big guy he's wearing a baseball hat and a

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Gray waffle shirt

50
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
And he grew up not far

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
Annie sez

52
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
It's a rough neighborhood

53
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
List all the hot water tank out of this house

54
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,616
They're still sweetness out of sugar around here if you letter

55
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
Jimmy

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Peter Rothschild

57
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
I mean after high school he got

58
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,760
Dealing drugs he went to jail on a gun charge

59
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,344
And even if you're not an ex-con Buffalo's a tough place to find

60
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
But there's one local industry.

61
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,208
It was hiring a place where even if you had a criminal record

62
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
You could get a job

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
And that's the deck

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,816
Jimmy got a job at one of the big

65
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
Corporate debt collection

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,912
Hundreds of people sitting in cubicles

67
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,704
Calling people who haven't paid their credit card

68
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Al pretty quickly Jimmy realized

69
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
He was really good at

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,944
I was one of the best walking in there smoking like a pound of weed and out of all those people you know I was produced

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,272
U90 called over the PA pick pain meds

72
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,112
But only because of the money I was making you only good as the last payment you got

73
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,160
So this was the Golden Age of deck

74
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,464
Right we remember the mortgage part of this

75
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,584
But people were also in debt for gym membership for book clubs or payday loans

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
Normally couldn't pay

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
You needed someone who could

78
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
Call them up

79
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
And get them to pay

80
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
And that was Jimmy

81
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,800
Jimmy got in trouble with the law again and got fired from that

82
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
Corporate debt collection job

83
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
He thought I don't need that

84
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
I'm going to open up my own shop

85
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,016
He convinced his brothers and sisters to stake him $10,000 and he rented his own off

86
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
So I actually visited his office on a few occasions and spent a lot of time there you walk up this tight little staircase

87
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
You get up to the top

88
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
And it's an old Karate Academy

89
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,632
Like kids used to take classes there sometime last week

90
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
Is all the way out there's there's like

91
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,520
Stranded equipment in like the back behind the cubicle

92
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,848
It looks like the whole place could have gone up yesterday and down tomorrow

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,688
In the main room is Jimmy and one other guy each have their desk

94
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,784
Heather kind of the corporate side and then all the workers are in back maybe half a dozen

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
In a cubicle

96
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:12,160
The office it's above a liquor store next to a used car lot

97
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,976
Across the street there's this little women's clothing

98
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
Scott is optimistic name

99
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
Sky's the limit

100
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
Jimmy took his mom to see the off

101
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Office just after you

102
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,423
But for my mom

103
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
To finally

104
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
Look at something I was doing

105
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
And smile

106
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,663
Pointed over across the street she says baby

107
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
You see that

108
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
That's a message for God

109
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
Jimmy has his mom's blessing

110
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
Yes his karate studio / off

111
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
Has his phone setup

112
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
He needs one more thing

113
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
He needs debt

114
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:51,071
So what that actually looks like is basically just a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that list hundreds of names of people

115
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
Who borrow money and didn't pay it back

116
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,191
And last week we met up with Jimmy he shows us one of these spreadsheet

117
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,263
He pulls out his iPhone and the screen is all cracked up

118
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
It looks like crap

119
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
Barely read on it but

120
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,199
I mean it's just tracked all up the screen is cracked up

121
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,015
The spreadsheet shows us has hundreds and hundreds of names

122
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,599
If this case these names are people who took out payday loans

123
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,951
If reach name there is this incredible amount of information

124
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
The address of the debtor

125
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,791
Social security number

126
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,351
The balance that they that they borrow

127
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,423
Some of them even come with an email address such as this one

128
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,215
That's the bank account number

129
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
You have the home phone number

130
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
Some of them have cell phone number

131
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,383
The majority have place of employment

132
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Jimmy

133
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Bought this

134
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,735
Spreadsheet he says he paid $18,000

135
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
And what that means is

136
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,599
All these people on the spreadsheet these hundreds of people

137
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,439
They used to owe money to a payday loan Chopper to some big debt collection firm

138
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
Now every one of those people

139
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
Deo Jimmy

140
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,071
Spreadsheets like this are not easy to find

141
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:59,679
Jimmy couldn't just call the bank and say hey it's Jimmy from Buffalo yeah I can you sell me some debt

142
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
Now it doesn't work like that

143
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Jimmy said

144
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
It's the same situation he was in when he used to sell drugs

145
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:11,199
It's just like streets I mean you know you I can't walk into Mexico and go tell some some drug cartel

146
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,039
Listen man I'm from the hood in Buffalo man give me all the keys you got

147
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,599
The man is the proper chain of command

148
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
You'll come here and talk to me

149
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,183
You are saying can you imagine that

150
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
In other words

151
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
Jimmy needs a dealer

152
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,303
He needs someone who can start getting in those Microsoft Excel spread

153
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
He puts the word out and he finds a guy named Blair

154
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
Just Larry

155
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
He asked us not to use his last name

156
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
Jimmy

157
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Such and such

158
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,055
Over here has an agency and he's looking for something

159
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
I called Jimmy up

160
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,663
And I came right to visit him

161
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Light

162
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
Just got to

163
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
A good level understanding

164
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
Larry has a lot in common with g

165
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,647
They both grew up in rough neighborhoods Larry went to prison on robbery and drug charges

166
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
They got a job at a big debt collection company

167
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
And then he went out on his own

168
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,303
Larry's Niche was waking up people who are looking to sell that

169
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,607
What those were looking to buy it he's the middleman

170
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
And in the same way that a few years back

171
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,215
Global debt Market was booming

172
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
Larry says in Buffalo things were booming to

173
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,591
Why do people like Jimmy we're getting into the business

174
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
All of a sudden

175
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,687
There became an explosion

176
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
Substrate level

177
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Agencies

178
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
On just about every

179
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
Block

180
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Geyser

181
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
I'm in out of prison literally

182
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
In a couple of months

183
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
They're running a collection

184
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
They get that that they get people on the phone

185
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
Daystar down

186
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Start collect

187
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,471
Larry says those street-level guys those guys like to meet we're really good

188
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Getting people

189
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
Collection agencies

190
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
The bread-and-butter collectors that become the top

191
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
Collectors

192
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,663
I always the guys from this tree

193
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,735
Yeah when you say from the streets what do you mean

194
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
I mean like

195
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
Didn't go to college

196
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
Didn't didn't grow up in the suburbs

197
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
You know

198
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,023
Pretty much came up the same way I did

199
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,607
On on on on on food stamps and ramen noodles

200
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,983
What do you think it is about growing up that way that makes people good at

201
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
At the job

202
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
Hunger

203
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Just being hungry to want something

204
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
Jimmy was hungry

205
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,735
At that office in the old karate studio he hired a small staff to go through the spreadsheet

206
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
Call people who owed money

207
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,087
When they got people on the phone then transfer the call to Jimmy

208
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,903
Twitter Jimmy made a profit or went bankrupt

209
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
Came down to what Jimmy said

210
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
Jimmy is about to talk to someone

211
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Who's refused to pay collector

212
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
Again and again

213
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
People who are so unlikely to pay

214
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,959
The Jimmy was able to buy their debt for pennies on the dollar

215
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,775
$100 payday loan he might buy for a dollar

216
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,615
Because the odds are if you can find them at all they're probably going to hang up on

217
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
But there's that beautiful moment when Jimmy actually gets the person on the other end of the line and then everything comes down to what he says

218
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
There's an art to it

219
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
In fact they call it

220
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
The talk off

221
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
And Jimmy has a

222
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
Few different talk off depending on who's got on the phone

223
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,975
Like there's a nice guy talk off

224
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
The person seems willing to pay

225
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:11,167
Nine times out of ten men these people just want somebody to listen to him you know you the first person ever talk to me like I was a human

226
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,031
I didn't pay the bill because the last guy I had a talk with no he was a o

227
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,103
I didn't pay the bill because I just didn't have it at that point time

228
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:25,503
When I first visited Jimmy a few years ago I heard him do a version of the nice guy talk off and one of the things you'll notice here besides

229
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
It's the sort of gentle tone

230
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Is all the

231
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
Formal sign language

232
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,415
You can hear me try to communicate that this is an official matter

233
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
He's not just some guy in an old karate studio

234
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
Calling you up about a

235
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,351
The last thing we want to do is get squeezed pressure you or put you in the position as to where

236
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
You making an arrangement and you're not go

237
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
To be with a G note

238
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,007
Hold it if we were to table this until the 1st

239
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,591
I wouldn't even want to keep it for the mouth that you're sure you were going to have

240
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
If we were to give you into

241
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
You have your funds available

242
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
But we don't want you to rely on someone else

243
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
You know a reference is selling us out

244
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,135
If you need it until the first how sure would you be that you would have those funds

245
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,207
Of course that's the way it goes when people are willing

246
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
When they're not

247
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
Jimmy gives a very different

248
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
The tough-guy.

249
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
You need to pay me

250
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
Before you go shopping

251
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
For you pay your rent

252
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
We pay your phone bill

253
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
Before you take care of this

254
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
If we take care of that

255
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Give me some money

256
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:26,175
Now and the tough guy talk off Jenny would sometimes get into a legal gray area

257
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,247
Under federal law guy Jimmy can't straight-up lied

258
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,343
I can't say payoff you're going to get thrown in jail or I'm going to take away your car

259
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
But what Jimmy would do is use the same kind of

260
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,487
Formal official language to imply that legal action was going to happen

261
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,559
Use trigger words such as refusal and this is

262
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
First substantive contact

263
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
New Jersey exam

264
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
This is a refusal you don't want to pay your bill

265
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:54,335
This is going to be considered first substantive contact we're going to contact your system before this as a refuse

266
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
We gave you an opportunity to pay it

267
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,247
And you didn't want to take advantage so this call actually ends with Jimmy hanging up on this one

268
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,551
Ian says she's going to call right back

269
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
And then boom like that

270
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,391
The woman called back and he's right back at it

271
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,463
Indian she doesn't end up collecting but that was his power move

272
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,047
I remember these are payday loans Jimmy's trying to collect

273
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Meaning

274
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,655
The people who borrow the money we're probably people who didn't have much money in the first play

275
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,727
People who didn't have access to better kinds of credit

276
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
What are the ugly things about this world is

277
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
This is it people like Jimmy

278
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Who don't have much money

279
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
Can't collect from

280
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Other people

281
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Who don't have much

282
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
Jimmy says

283
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
She understood

284
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,807
I mean look at where we sitting at right now

285
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,159
I don't feel good I know you I know

286
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
I'm pulling people out that take

287
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
Payday loans out I see they living condition look at mines

288
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
I've been in positions I mean just recently where you going to need a couple extra dollars and it's that in the third man I feel

289
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Horrible

290
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
Is Dallas feel like a hustler

291
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
No don't feel like you know legitimate work

292
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:04,223
Because you Coruscant people in again creating a sense of urgency for them to pay some that they don't got

293
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
Would you Otis money

294
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
And I got kids to feed

295
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
Because I bought this portfolio

296
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
I understand

297
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
Still after a few years

298
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,791
Jimmy shop does well enough that he's able to move to a bigger office

299
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
In a more upscale neighborhood

300
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
That's real nice off

301
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,911
Fake trees all that crazy stuff

302
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
How many people were working

303
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,543
At one time at the most had 17 people working in there

304
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
Around the same time

305
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,407
It's all those street-level agencies were springing up and looking for debt to buy

306
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
Business was booming for Jimmy's dealer

307
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Larry

308
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Yeah

309
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
I was I was doing great

310
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
I had

311
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
Two homes paid for

312
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
Who was Playboy's

313
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,815
We will toast those we we have more money than the drug dealers they looked up to us

314
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
If you have a spreadsheet and a good talk off

315
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Drink

316
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
At least

317
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
That's the way it was for a while

318
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,799
But just like people on Wall Street started going wild with debt going to

319
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Far

320
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,383
People in Buffalo started Crossing out of that gray area

321
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
And doing things that were just blatantly Italy

322
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,759
So the illegal version of the talk off has its own name

323
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
Jimmy calls

324
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:16,927
The Buffalo taka fire another guy call it the shake and basically it's we're coming to your house we're going to arrest you

325
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
The kids are going to Social Services

326
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
I will taking your car all lies

327
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,119
The most awful things you could think of to just scare people silly into pay

328
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,959
The guys doing that stuff the guys doing the Buffalo talk off

329
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,519
They are some of the people buying debt from Larry

330
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
That is supposed to come with

331
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Paperwork

332
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,943
Sometimes the paperwork is virtual sometimes it's actually boxes full of paper

333
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Prove it

334
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
The people in the spreadsheets really owe the money

335
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:47,647
The proof that there's a clear chain of ownership from the original bank or payday loan shop all the way through

336
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Two different debt collectors

337
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
What Larry says

338
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:55,071
The street-level guys doing the shake doing the Buffalo talk off they weren't paying attention to India

339
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
My street-level guys

340
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
They don't care nothing about the pay

341
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
Bottom don't even know about it

342
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,591
Just get me the portfolio I got Wolves at my agency we're going to get the money all they want is that fine

343
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,895
This kind of disregard for the law

344
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,967
It's happening all the way up to the top of the Dead food chain

345
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Apple store

346
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
Selling the same spreadsheet

347
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
The two or three different debt collector

348
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
Chris at the same time

349
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,695
That means if you're one of the people who owed money you might get a call from one deck

350
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Pay off your debt to them

351
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,559
And then hear from another collector saying hey you all this money

352
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:31,167
And it's important understand here that this just isn't happening at the street level in Buffalo

353
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
You got guys way up

354
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,495
The food chain where wealthy Finance

355
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
People who are getting their hands on files they

356
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
They don't own

357
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
And her selling a bit straight of theft

358
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
Larry Wanda broken a few deals where his

359
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,223
Customers got some of the stolen debt

360
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:48,831
This of course got him into trouble with his customers and no thing he says is his own fault

361
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
We let greed

362
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,159
Step in like we we we

363
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,975
We stopped doing our due diligence

364
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Because the money was right there

365
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
To be gotten

366
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
And we wanted

367
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
For Jimmy it all came to an end

368
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Just a few months ago

369
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Normally

370
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
When he convince someone to pay their debt

371
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
The money would appear in his bank account

372
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Shortly after

373
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
But one day

374
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
That money didn't show up

375
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:14,687
I was looking for some money to be deposited on a Friday and it never came

376
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
And Monday it never came

377
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,039
There's a company that process payments for gym

378
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
And that company turns out just

379
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
Cut him off cold decided not to work with

380
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,695
Jimmy says that this happened to a lot of smell like

381
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Agencies in Buffalo

382
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
He says they got cut off and then they couldn't process

383
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Entertainment Cinema

384
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Bust

385
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:35,423
But you know it's hard to tell what really happened maybe it was just Jimmy went to far too many times and that

386
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Gray area

387
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,263
Too many people complained about the charges on the account so the process

388
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
You just said enough

389
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:47,455
In any case without that Payment Processing Company there's no way for Jimmy to get paid I mean that just pulls the plug on his operation

390
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
He can't pay his workers

391
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,295
Is rent Mesa what you do with your office

392
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,343
I didn't do anything with it I lost it

393
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Lost

394
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,791
After we talked to Jimmy I put out some calls and it turns out the federal government is cracking down on somebody's payment processor

395
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
Holding them accountable

396
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
For what payday lenders

397
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:09,727
So you'll maybe Jimmy was right it's possible that he did get shut down as part of some broader Suite

398
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,335
Larry Jimmy's dealer he got out of the business before this cracked

399
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,663
He bought a little house in a working-class suburb outside of Buffalo

400
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
We actually talked in there in his garage

401
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,503
Get a weight bench little mini fridge

402
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
Bottled water in it

403
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:28,671
I just want to just be a regular normal guy waking up everyday listening to the birds cutting my grass

404
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:32,255
Goodman thumbs up to the neighbor that's what I do all the time

405
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,815
Jimmy is now trying to get into real estate

406
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,119
That boarded-up house where we met him

407
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
The one where the thieves stole the hot water heater

408
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Jimmy actually bought that house for

409
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
For $2,000

410
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,031
He wants to fix it up and rent it out

411
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
He said he's glad to be out of

412
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
I'm tired of running

413
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,687
I need something a little but a lot more

414
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
A lot more solid

415
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Like Houses

416
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,087
Solid solid as houses I think is the expression

417
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,183
Solitude is raggedy one is but you got to start somewhere

418
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,255
Like a lot of the world Jimmy came out of the boom and bust

419
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
The Bowery star

420
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Without me

421
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,751
Just a note about today's show

422
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,079
In the original version we use Jimmy's last name

423
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,895
Upper today show we have omitted it at Jimmy's

424
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431

The show was originally produced by Jess Jiang today's rerun was produced by Rihanna

427
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:38,815
Jake Halpern book has a lot more about Larry and Jimmy and this whole world

428
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
Of debt collection

429
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887

430
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:46,239
