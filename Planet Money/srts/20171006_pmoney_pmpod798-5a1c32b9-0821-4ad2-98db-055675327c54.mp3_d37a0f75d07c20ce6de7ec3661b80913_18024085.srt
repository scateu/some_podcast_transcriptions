1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,560
It was a big week for apology

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,120
And they all happen to come from one

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:05,888
Person

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,912
Richard Smith

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,960
I truly and deeply

6
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,984
Sorry for what happened

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,032
I deeply apologize steaks were made

8
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,312
Which again

9
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:16,384
I deeply apologize I apologize said that that is what happened

10
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:20,992
Okay moving on Richard Smith was testifying before Congress

11
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:21,760
Because he is

12
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,808
Uber CEO

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832
Equifax

14
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,136
Inform this last month that

15
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,440
Basically all of us have been

16
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:35,072
The company announced that the information for almost 150 million Americans

17
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,656
Has been compromised and I know you've heard this sort of thing before with other hat

18
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,424
But this hack

19
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,448
Is different

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
Because for starters

21
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,776
You did not sign up for Equus

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,568
Which is one of the three major

23
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,128
Basically your entire life

24
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
They have been

25
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
Slurping up and

26
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:50,944
Storing

27
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712
You're most

28
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
Personal information

29
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,272
Which means that Equifax

30
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
And maybe now the hackers

31
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,344
Know my social security

32
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,624
And my address

33
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,696
And the fact that I opened the Gap credit card in the fact that I missed

34
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,744
The payment last month in the fact that I only paid

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,888
$300 towards my Subaru Impreza instead of the 400 that I normally pay cuz I'm sure they know everything

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
150 million Americans looking over our shoulders for the rest of our lives worried about someone

37
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,336
Filing your tax forms

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,504
My personal nightmare is somebody walking into Home Depot opening up a credit card with my name on it grabbing a giant

39
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,784
Orange shopping cart

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
Filling it with

41
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
Drills and circular saws and shop vacs and getting 10% off the whole thing by 10%

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
At any rate

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
Bad

44
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
Which was pointed out to Richard Smith

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
Buy a lot of our elected

46
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,728
Talk about ham-handed responses this is simply unacceptable

47
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,568
White you should be held personally accountable

48
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,640
Am I last 13 seconds I'm going to speak to America

49
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,944
I don't to save for the hundred and forty-five

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
Million people

51
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,016
File a lawsuit otherwise

52
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:04,416
They're going to keep doing you what they've been doing it forever hello and welcome to Planet Money on Robertson

53
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
And I'm Kenny Malone

54
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
And this Equifax hack

55
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
Feels like a

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
Dystopian

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,096
Sci-fi future Wicked

58
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,448
Shadow hackers roaming through our data in the central location

59
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,496
The we didn't even sign up for

60
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,544
Feels like such a modern-day problem

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,592
I get this whole mess goes back

62
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
21 mon

63
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,176
A moment when two brothers in Brooklyn

64
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,016
Decided they were going to sell our private information to the world

65
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
And we were not going to be the customers

66
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
We were going to be the product

67
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,928
This happened a hundred and fifty

68
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Years ago

69
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,280
And people were asking themselves the same questions we are asking ourselves now

70
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
Who owns

71
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Your information

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,888
Who has a right to see that information

73
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
And is there any limit

74
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
On what someone is allowed to dig up on you

75
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
It is quite the story

76
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Beloved after the break

77
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
Support for this podcast

78
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592

Hey Nora this is Robert

83
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
Show us the way to the secret documents

84
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,632
We heard that one of the very first credit

85
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Ever

86
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
Precursor this whole Equifax thing

87
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,520
Was in the archives here at the New York Pub

88
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Book Library

89
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
North Lyons health

90
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
Portable storage

91
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
Show this to the famous

92
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Rose reading room

93
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
APA Library

94
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480
And research coordinator named Rebecca

95
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
Walks in

96
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
And gently hold

97
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
This little blue booklet out

98
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,768
I brought a pair of gloves I didn't know if we would need them to type in the Bible

99
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,120
Gloves with the Gutenberg you there

100
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
The front of this book says

101
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
Retail Mercantile agency

102
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
1874

103
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,264
It looks like a

104
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
A phone book

105
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,872
Is a list of about 4000 people who live in Brooklyn back in the day

106
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
And then neck

107
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
To eat name

108
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,992
An address and then some old-timey job butchers

109
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
Druggist so many groceries

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,184
And there was a sailor of some sort with his name

111
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Alyssa name

112
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,047
And sure enough next to each name is a letter

113
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
A letter grade

114
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
The tells us

115
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,887
Just how trustworthy

116
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
Captain Colin

117
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
So we flip to the front of the book

118
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,543
I'll look right here so this is the key and a means

119
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
The captain pays his debts

120
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Right away

121
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,639
If they're going to be there with me

122
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
He always paid in cash

123
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
Letter C with mean perhaps

124
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
She didn't always pay its debts on time

125
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,855
And then there's one final code and it's an ampersand or like the

126
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
And it basically means

127
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,511
When I get to put this person's reading this book come talk to us there's some stuff you should probably know about this person

128
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,327
We had some questions about how the book

129
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
Worked in real life in Brooks

130
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
Glenn back in the day

131
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Josh Lauer

132
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
He wrote a book

133
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:03,359
My book is called credit-worthy it history of consumer surveillance and financial identity in America

134
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
I did

135
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,943
Explain to us the credit in the early 1800s

136
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
It was not what we think of

137
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Today

138
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,063
It wasn't credit cards or auto loans because

139
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Delete those did not occur

140
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
What credit meant was

141
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Tab at your town

142
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,743
So excited Robert Smith

143
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
You are a farmer

144
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
AT&T

145
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
What crops

146
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
Apple

147
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
Sir Robert goes to the grocery store to pick up

148
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Whatever he need

149
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Maybe you like

150
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
Butter

151
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
Some cigars

152
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
And Robert tells the grocer

153
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Yeah

154
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,895
I don't have any money the Apple crop hasn't come in yet

155
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:42,783
And so I'm going to need you to send me some credit and I as a grocer I look at Robert

156
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
And I say

157
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
Oh mr. Smith will

158
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,647
I know your uncle and I've known your father and

159
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,463
Darn it if I don't trust the Smiths more than I trust myself

160
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
And he says

161
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,631
Take your butter take your cigars I know you'll come back next week and you'll settle and

162
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
And that system worked

163
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
For a long time but

164
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,031
After the Civil War people started moving around

165
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,847
Adding two cities especially Brooklyn New York

166
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,895
Give me a little sound effects from Brooklyn

167
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
How about this

168
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,455
Extra extra Read All About It

169
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
Population of Brooklyn booming

170
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
This created a problem

171
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
More Strangers for showing up the grocer

172
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
Restore looking to buy things on

173
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,695
And the grocer needed to answer a pretty simple question

174
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
Will this person pay me back

175
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
I know nothing about

176
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
Enter

177
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
The cells

178
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
Herman and Conrad sells

179
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,983
And they're missing a lot of evidence that survives about them and about who they are

180
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,055
Super purposes of the story we can imagine them however

181
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
We like

182
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,895
You know handlebar mustaches blue velvet vest

183
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,967
Monical's maybe pocket watches

184
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247

Yes yes the the cells is where mr. peanut

00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
Where in Brooklyn in 1860

191
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
And he start going around

192
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
Butchers in

193
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
The druggist

194
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Taylors

195
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
And saying

196
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,655
We're organizing a list of all customers

197
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
NRA

198
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:08,031
So it would be great your cobbler if you would let me look at your books and find out

199
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Who's in there

200
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Uses credit

201
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
Is back that credit

202
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,943
And that way if a stranger named Robert Smith

203
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
Walks into my store

204
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,527
I would just pull out the cells book

205
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,879
Yeah look right here Robert Smith

206
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
Plumber

207
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
1102 Lafayette Avenue

208
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
Bank

209
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:32,095
Put pants on Robert Smith model vetru that's snow

210
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
No

211
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
The one thing that struck us when we looked at

212
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
It's a little pamphlet if you can almost

213
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
Feel the cells trying to be a

214
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Triple S

215
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
As humanly possible

216
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,591
Give the minimum amount of information

217
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
You're not

218
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
Judging people that slander

219
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
Put down the name the job

220
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
And a simple little Ray

221
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
It was almost

222
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,183
As if the cells knew that if they were going to create an industry where people's information was the product

223
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
But maybe like just maybe

224
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
You should be careful with that in

225
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
We should note it says confidential

226
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,399
Which means

227
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,799
Sitting here reading these names and these ratings this is the equivalent of an 1874 Equifax hack

228
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:18,175
18 something something and leaking everybody's credit rating

229
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,247
The cells idea was a huge success it was

230
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,807
Obviously good for retailers who could

231
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,087
Landmark Credit and

232
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,391
Sell more stuff

233
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
People who wanted to buy

234
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
People like my

235
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,511
Doppelganger from the 1800s Bob Smith

236
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
The plumber

237
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
She could get credit

238
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,399
Almost anywhere because it said in a little book that he always pay

239
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
His death

240
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
And

241
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,311
Frankly he could probably get a discount on the things he bought because he was not a real

242
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,407
These credit reports were such a big success that over the next century

243
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,431
Thousands

244
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
A credit bureaus were established

245
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
All over the

246
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
And like any competitive market

247
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,599
Replace these bureaus tried to have

248
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
The best product which

249
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
In this case means that

250
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,255
There was Market pressure for more and more

251
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,607
Yeah the self Brothers just give you a letter grade but imagine some other credit age

252
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
Nancy says well you know we have a bunch of

253
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Personal information

254
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
About Robert Smith the plumber

255
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,775
Don't want to buy our book instead

256
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
And so

257
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
A lot of information

258
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Ended up

259
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
In People's Credit files marital status

260
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Marital status

261
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,479
Married men married men were considered less risky

262
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,527
Remain upstanding and pay their debts

263
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,111
Do I want to know medical condition if you could know something about that

264
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,695
Give a broken foot and can't work that be good to know might not pay back your debts

265
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,023
What about vices drinking gambling philandering absolutely

266
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,327
Overtime credit bureaus realize that

267
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
Southeast Asia as they were just useful for lenders

268
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
Insurance companies and

269
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
Employers might also like to see them

270
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
And so they kept growing and building their Consumer Report

271
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
Consumer sort of knew that

272
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Mission was being collect

273
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,687
But the full extent of this collection

274
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
Came out in 1966

275
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,575
Because of an almost offhand comment in Washington DC

276
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
What happened was the Congress

277
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,415
Does holding a totally unrelated set of

278
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,255
The Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US Census Bureau work

279
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
Proposing

280
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
Computerised centralized

281
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
And the representatives were losing their mind

282
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,191
This was Big Brother this could not stand

283
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,007
So they helped urine and during one of those hearing

284
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
A computer expert

285
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Testifying

286
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
And he was like

287
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,663
You guys are worried about collection and centralization of data

288
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
You do know that's already happening right

289
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
With the

290
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
Credit bureaus

291
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
In Congress was like

292
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
What

293
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Weenie

294
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,647
New hearings right now let's do it

295
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
It actually took two years but let's do it

296
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
And the news coverage of the time

297
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
Could have come from this week

298
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,375
Weekend Washington another day of hearing on the behavior of the credit bureaus

299
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,727
Keep records on almost everyone

300
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
Nothing

301
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
A figurehead from

302
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
One of these

303
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,991
Credit attorney for the Reaper

304
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
Belk credit

305
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
Retail credit

306
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
What's one of the largest

307
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Girls at the time

308
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:10,207
I'm in this next piece of tape has no relevant but just listen to how he talks

309
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,559
Cit

310
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
What came out was this

311
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Pretty

312
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Damning

313
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
Copy of

314
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
Someone's credit report

315
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
We have a copy of this because

316
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
It was filed during the

317
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,311
It's for a woman named Mary Wilson

318
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,871
And she was having trouble finding a job

319
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
She learned

320
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
Because of what the retail Credit Company

321
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Put in this

322
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,759
It says here

323
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
That Mary is quote

324
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
Dominating

325
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
Peculiar

326
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
And worst of all

327
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
Quote neurotic

328
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
Or cicada

329
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
It does not say

330
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
Who said this about her maybe it was her neighbor or some

331
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
What you work with

332
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,167
For sure we know it was not a doctor diagnosing her a psychotic

333
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
It was essentially a p

334
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
The 1960 senators were outraged

335
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
At the retail Credit Company

336
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,711
But instead of apologizing the retail credit companies lawyer dug in his heels

337
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:09,087
Say is bandied around in these hearings result was a dirty word and it is

338
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,439
It was a dirty word because these hearings spawn the first major piece of legislation

339
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
Do finally regulate Credit Bureau

340
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
Call The Fair Credit Reporting Act

341
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Of 1970

342
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,631
That law and some of the Amendments that they

343
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
That would come later

344
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,703
They would effectively stop credit bureaus

345
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
From collecting hearsay and rumor

346
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,335
Allow consumers to see their own credit files they would

347
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
How to fix errors

348
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
And to limit some of the reasons

349
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
The people could pull

350
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
Your consumer

351
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
The credit reporting industry change pretty quick

352
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,111
Computers made the data could be centralized and spread more easily

353
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,975
Which make you didn't need small Regional bureaus in every town to collect Aspen

354
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:51,071
Industry Consolidated Consolidated Consolidated until

355
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,631
Eventually there were only three big credit reporting

356
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
And Josh Lauer our credit historian

357
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
Since the retail Credit Company

358
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
Took such a beating

359
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
During these hearings

360
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
And in the years to come

361
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,847
But it decided to change its name

362
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
2 something

363
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
More equal sound

Fact-based equal and Stockbridge

366
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
They change their name

367
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
To Equifax

368
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791

To bring us up to the present we know that Equifax got hacked

377
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
And we know it was much worse

378
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
Then what we did in the library

379
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
The sells Brothers Little Blue Book

380
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
And we should say here that

381
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,519
We reached out to Equifax and one of the major trade associations that represents them

382
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
They both declined

383
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
To be interviewed but

384
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,639
We still had questions about what we are supposed

385
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
To do now can you hear us

386
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,015
Consumer

387
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,319
The lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center

388
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
We've been telling everyone

389
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,439
Will listen to us freeze your credit report at all three credit bureaus

390
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,791
Equifax Experian and Transunion those are the big three credit bureaus and

391
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
A freeze basically means

392
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
But no one is allowed to

393
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
Pull my credit

394
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
Not unless I temporarily lift the

395
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
The freeze

396
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,823
For them that way if somebody tries to open a gap card with my stolen

397
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Information

398
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
Gap would go and try to check my credit

399
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,943
But they wouldn't be allowed because

400
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
The fries and a gap application

401
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Now here's the catch

402
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
And it depends on where you live but

403
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
This is something that credit bureaus

404
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
Typically charge you to do

405
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,511
Protect your own information to have to pay to temporarily lift or

406
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:02,655
Father freeze when you do want credit card do you have to pay again

407
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
The pressure on that

408
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,983
They're saying that they're going to remove their fees

409
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
Which seems like the very least they could do

410
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:12,383
But she says this is the moment where everyone who has had a beef

411
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
Over the last few decades

412
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
Credit reporting industry

413
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Is trying to

414
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
To change whatever it is they think it's wrong

415
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
And there's a lot of

416
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,135
What people would like to see a higher accuracy standard

417
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
For the credit bureaus did like them

418
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
Easier for people

419
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
How to change errors in their reports

420
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,303
And it's also a call to limit who is allowed to

421
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
Use your credit report

422
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
To judge you

423
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,703
Chichi says this is true especially for employers with this sense that

424
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,055
The credit report is some sort of proxy for how responsible someone is

425
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
I think Robert Smith think

426
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,895
I think if I had a bad credit score Robert wisdom

427
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
I'm just looking across the table from him

428
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
Idlewood

429
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,575
Just pay the bills on time

430
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,135
It could have been because something bad happened to Kenny

431
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
All right yeah Robert Miss payments or default because they lose their job

432
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
They get

433
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Sick

434
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,167
They get divorced if you know there's a death in the family

435
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,751
A lot of times bad credit is a result of bad luck

436
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
This seems to be served

437
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Dancing around the

438
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
The Quarry issue

439
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:18,431
Why not just pass a law that says they can't have my credit information unless

440
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,503
I say yes that would certainly give

441
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,319
Consumers a measure of control

442
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,623
Now how effective that would be

443
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:33,279
I'm not sure because in order for you to get credit you probably end up having to agree to this

444
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
You never leave

445
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,119
They keep pulling you back in

446
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
Where the product where the asset

447
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
In other words we are not

448
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
And have never been

449
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
The customer

450
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
Tell me the story makes me think that like

451
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,407
The sellers Brothers in the 18 hundreds really did

452
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
Decide the direction of

453
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
The entire industry

454
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,783
Because you know they could have provided

455
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
Letters of credit

456
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
Two people like

457
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,647
Robert Smith the plumber back in the 1800

458
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,463
They could have provided little laminated if you could laminate

459
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:08,351
They could have provided a little framed letter that said this person is worthy of credit and that way the customer

460
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,655
Would keep control of their own information

461
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:16,543
But they decided not to do it that way they decided that the money was in the business has the businesses were willing to pay

462
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,103
So it ever since then you and me and

463
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,895
Regular consumers have had no sex

464
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
So

465
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
Let's all go freeze okra

466
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
