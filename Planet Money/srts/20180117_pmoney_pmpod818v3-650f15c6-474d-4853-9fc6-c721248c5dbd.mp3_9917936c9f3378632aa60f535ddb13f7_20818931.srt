1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,096
Last week Elsa and I found ourselves in store down in Chinatown

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,888
Oh yeah

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,192
Lowe's

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:14,080
Ginseng the small light brown sweater bumpy root

5
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:17,408
You can find it in pretty much any Chinatown anywhere in the

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,736
Just on this one street alone there are tons of places

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,504
Like this one

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,296
Stop doing this route

9
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:28,160
798 dollars for pounds weight look on the right here

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,208
998

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,744
Dollars account

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,536
Julie and I are staring at this

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,816
Locked glass

14
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,120
Explain different trays of ginseng

15
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,960
Is this 1184 pounder

16
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:49,408
Seems like a lot of money especially if you spin around and you look at the bins in the back of the store

17
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,688
Filled with ginseng

18
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,528
But that ginseng is only going for $9

19
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,832
Okay so this is the affordable stuff

20
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,112
This isn't the elf

21
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,392
Chang budget category

22
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
Okay

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
The Roots were looking at

24
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,768
Very similar to me

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
Chinese yam

26
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
Yeah they're both the same color

27
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
Beige

28
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
Don't come out of the ground

29
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,192
The skins on both

30
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,984
What kind of Nabi and bumby

31
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,032
But there's this huge

32
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
Price difference

33
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,128
Which is because of one main difference

34
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
In route

35
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:26,784
And that is that the expensive stuff the stuff that's in this locked glass case going for a thousand an ounce

36
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,064
That is

37
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
Wild

38
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,208
Wild ginseng has been used in Chinese medicine for thousands of years

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,768
It said to treat anything from fatigue

40
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,096
Cancer Daily just over Christmas I had this terrible cold

41
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
And my mom kept pumping

42
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,728
Thermos bottles of ginseng tea into me day after day

43
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,312
To some people like your mom ginseng is the ultimate

44
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Killer

45
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
But specifically what people want is wild ginseng

46
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
They're willing to pay

47
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
Thousands more dollars

48
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
What difference does it make when I eat it

49
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:08,000
What's wrong

50
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,560
And like that route is more potent

51
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,864
So this label Wild

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,656
It's used to make all the difference

53
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,472
Juliet's the label wild suddenly assigns to the route

54
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
Oldies

55
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
Potent healing power

56
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
And it

57
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592
How does a huge jump in price

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
Which got me wondering

59
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
Who gets to decide

60
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,712
What's wild and wet

61
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
Not

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
Because whoever gets decide that

63
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
Is essentially deciding who gets to make the most

64
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
Profits interest

65
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
And this business

66
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,536
Is barely regulated so it makes for some pretty interesting Dynamics in the industry

67
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:48,448
I've been looking into this for a few months and what I found was it people will lie for ginseng

68
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,752
People cheats for ginseng they even steal

69
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,920
And in one case I found one man even murdered for ginseng

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,624
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Julia DeWitt and I know if the change today on the show we travel out to the woods of Appalachia

71
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,184
What are some of the ginseng grows wild

72
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
And some does not

73
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,560
Attempts to pass one off for the other can we pull out of hiding

74
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:19,680
The chance to make big profits without a lot of rules has found a dark side to the ginseng

75
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
Will meet one man

76
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,408
This message comes from NPR sponsor Capital One Capital One is reimagining banking by offering account

79
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
Capital One na

80
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
I get my car in New York and my headset the Appalachian

81
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,728
Ginseng is native to a few places in the world like China off of Siberia

82
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
And the Appalachian Mountains in the United States what I want to talk to

83
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
Someone about that wild American ginseng there are

84
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:12,928
A lot of people out in the mountains to gather wild thing but they're not easy to find there's almost no sign

85
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:19,327
Nine of them online they're super secretive they definitely do not want some journalists coming out and poke

86
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Being around which

87
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,751
Is it and it took me weeks to find anyone that would talk to me

88
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,567
I finally found this one guy named Larry

89
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,967
Do you have that in the mountains on the border of Maryland and West Virginia and that is how you ended up in your car

90
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:42,367
Heading south in Appalachia on 68 very close to Larry's house

91
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,767
It is full on winter here like snow on the ground I'm following these handwritten

92
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55,167
Directions I have on the seat beside me because my GPS won't take me to the right place otherwise

93
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
There are security cameras pointing never Direction over some potholes

94
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,967
Then at the end of the Scrabble Road I come to a big

95
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
10 Warehouse

96
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
I parked next to a pig

97
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,391
As I get up close to the door I see the sign

98
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,975
It feels kind of like one of those home is where the heart is sign

99
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,559
Except this one has a picture of two shotguns on it

100
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,119
And says we don't call and I

101
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543
How are you doing very good

102
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,199
Play for all the security Larry is a super nice guy when I get to his farm he comes out in a hoodie

103
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
And he shows me into his office

104
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,879
Larry's office is like a jin-sang

105
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
He's Got Roots in jars

106
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,231
Alcohol in glass cases on little bit

107
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
Pillows

108
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
On a shelf next to

109
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,143
He called it his Million Dollar Man

110
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
Because it shapes

111
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Like a man

112
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
An anatomically correct

113
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,287
Man you got your arms

114
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,823
You got your legs

115
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
You got your tallywacker

116
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
I mean he's welfare

117
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
The whole nine yards

118
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,735
Lyrics planes that roots that look like

119
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
Humans are especially valuable in the Asia

120
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,135
Roots shaped like bodies are traditionally believed to be

121
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
Good for your whole body if it's shaped like

122
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Like your arm

123
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Your arms

124
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Leg

125
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Capri lighting

126
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,351
Is down here and some that we

127
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
Do I have a lotta

128
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
Pictures

129
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,239
Think like that

130
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
All over the wall

131
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,311
One is at his dad needs

132
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
In a field of

133
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,871
Can you tell me the first time you heard

134
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
Heard the word ginseng

135
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,247
I'll just real I don't know where I was

136
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,111
Larry is been going out into the woods looking for ginseng it since he was a little

137
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
Head is an Appalachian

138
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
Grandfather did it

139
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Dad did it

140
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
His dad taught

141
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,327
When I was little kid dad he'd always take us out and

142
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
Biggest ginseng

143
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Along with my three other brothers

144
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,239
The how I learned how to find anything that would take us out

145
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
Okay I found one

146
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:13,663
So then we'd all scramble around trying to figure out you know getting front of window try to find it you want to mean

147
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,735
Ask Larry to give me a quick rundown of how ginseng

148
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,575
He explains it first you have to have it knife

149
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
Above ground plants

150
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Pretty modest

151
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Doc bao

152
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
Lehigh

153
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Leaves on top

154
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
Then when you go to dig it up

155
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
You have to be

156
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
Very careful when you extract the root

157
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
From the dirt

158
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
He damage it

159
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Not worth it

160
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Yeah totally different

161
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
What were standing there in his office

162
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
Larry pulled out some route

163
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,823
To show me what he ultimately wants to bring home

164
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
From the woods

165
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Your wild is going to be

166
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
Really dark

167
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
Deep ring

168
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
Unlike cultivated

169
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Wild

170
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Ginseng

171
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
Tulare the wild staff

172
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Meaning

173
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
Super valuable stuff

174
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,207
It looks obviously different to someone with a trained eye

175
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,791
And he says well ginseng is disappearing in Appalachia

176
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
I used to be a whole lot more of it growing in

177
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
In the area

178
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,935
And now it's really hard to find wild ginseng in the woods

179
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Anywhere

180
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,311
Factory farming this isn't a solution to the shortage of wild

181
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,663
A lot of ginseng is mass-produced in Wisconsin on big farms

182
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,759
But they dumped a bunch of fertilizer on it and when it comes out of the ground

183
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
It looks different to expert

184
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Mike Larry

185
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,391
If you look at the texture of the route is going to be more

186
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
Potato skin

187
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Slick

188
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,023
Hi texture version your wild

189
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,351
Gnarly type texture you see your your Ringo and it has

190
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Totally deaf

191
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:42,495
Yeah totally different looks like a staff Elsa and I saw in China

192
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
In the bins in the back of the

193
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
The cheapest

194
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,127
Larry doesn't want to sell the chi

195
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
Cheap stuff so over the years

196
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
People Like Larry

197
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
Developed

198
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
A workaround

199
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
If you plant ginseng in the woods

200
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
You don't call it

201
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
What fertilizer

202
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
And if you wait 10 years or so

203
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
Then you can grow something that looks a lot

204
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
Like wild

205
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
Which Larry reminds me is important

206
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
Because

207
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
Bottom line is

208
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
When we Harvest his crops

209
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
The closer

210
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
Resembles Wild

211
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
The more money we're going to receive

212
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
In the more money we want

213
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,311
You're saying I'm saying

214
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,127
Where it causes ginseng he grows in the woods

215
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
Wild simulated

216
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Ginseng

217
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
Which sounds like an oxymoron

218
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Simulated then

219
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Is that

220
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
Colinas Wild

221
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
Believe just play a game with me here first

222
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:36,511
I took a received from one of your plastic that goes up there on the hillside

223
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
And I just

224
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,607
I threw it over there on the other side of parking lot into the woods

225
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
What would that be

226
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,935
That would be

227
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,007
A my eyes I would say that's probably

228
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Wild you

229
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Okay

230
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,455
If I tell the soil I like scraped away hole for it through it in that hole would that be

231
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
Wild simulated ginseng

232
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
Okay then if I went back

233
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
And I put fungicides on it

234
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
What would that be

235
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,439
Still be called wild simulated ginseng

236
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,999
What were standing there I mean I'm

237
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
Still having a hard time

238
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Visualize

239
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,911
Like what is wild simulated ginseng what does that mean

240
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Larry says

241
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
He'll xiaomi

242
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:23,359
We go out to the garage where we getting

243
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:30,015
I don't really know what you call it

244
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Super

245
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:38,975
Souped up ATV

246
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
So we're looking at this Farm it basically just look like what

247
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,775
It looks sort of like what's but you can tell that some of the brush

248
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:58,175
Have been cleared and there are the straight lines like raised beds of dirt tell me how much is

249
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,975
The band a million dollars out across there when that's mature jin-sang I'll kiss your ass

250
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,791
So he's got this gold mine in the ground

251
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,887
His problem is that it actually looks so believable as wild ginseng

252
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
That it invites

253
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,239
Larry tells me this one story from 5

254
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
One night he's at home

255
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
And I had

256
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Detectors

257
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,127
That I knew when something was moving

258
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
I thought they were deer

259
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
So

260
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,991
Ignored it

261
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,039
You go back out the next day

262
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Wow

263
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
There you been here

264
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
What is it what did it look like

265
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
I was just

266
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
Were they just dug up all the plants all over I mean it's just

267
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Destruction

268
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
And the ginseng is

269
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Larry think

270
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,583
The neighbors they stolen

271
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
4

272
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,631
I'll probably be back

273
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
So the next weekend

274
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
She's ready

275
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
He's at home watching

276
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Pictures

277
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
And they go off

278
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,799
And like 11:30

279
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
I said okay

280
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
I think you're here

281
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
Larry goes down to his property he looks happen

282
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Into the trees

283
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Sure enough

284
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,015
There was a light icing I like it to trees

285
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
Maybe down in the back

286
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
So I backed up

287
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,903
Lay down in the weeds and I called the law

288
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,487
He meets the police up at the road and they walk back into the woods

289
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,559
You're down there it was pitch dark

290
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Pasadero Dr

291
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,167
Soon as we got about 10 yards from you

292
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
Police on the ground and they

293
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
Hit the ground and walked up to him

294
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
Turn that one guy over

295
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,615
That's where you found me said

296
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Kentucky

297
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,783
And you could have bought me with the dollar cuz I thought they was just local people put him in the jail is on Friday night to charge them

298
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
I got restitution

299
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
I never received a time where are they now

300
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Drink Kentucky

301
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
And hope this day in Kentucky

302
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,023
Larry says it's locked for them

303
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
That he wasn't carrying

304
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
Weapon that shotgun with me

305
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
The outcome would have been different

306
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
And in fact

307
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,495
Larry tells me a story to everyone in the ginseng business

308
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
Nose

309
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
This guy Bobby Joe Grubbs

310
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,407
He keeps sneaking onto the property have his neighbor Joseph cutter

311
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
2 steel Cutters ginseng

312
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,295
Cuttery keeps calling the police he says the police are not responding

313
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
And then

314
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
One day

315
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
Bobby Joe goes missing

316
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,439
The police they go search Cutters property

317
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,559
And they're in a mulch pile they find the dead body of Bobby Joe Grubb

318
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
Qatar had

319
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Shot

320
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Bobby Joe

321
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
Over ginseng

322
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
So there's a lot of crime images

323
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,567
And all goes back to the fact that the business itself

324
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
Pretty unregulated

325
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,407
Which criticism let's call it

326
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
Wiggle room

327
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,735
And Larry benefits from this

328
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
Mom standing with him back in the office

329
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,135
He pulled a bottle of ginseng infused moonshine off the show

330
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
And hold it up for me to read the label

331
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Harding's

332
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Wild

333
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
Ginseng moonshine

334
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
We don't have simulated in the title

335
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,935
We have a lot on that so it's in it's in the

336
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
It's in the back wording

337
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,335
I got to redo that again put your glasses on

338
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,895
That's the way it's supposed to be

339
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,967
Sweet prince

340
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
In the fine print

341
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
Larry has a wry smile on his face

342
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
Funny says this like

343
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,647
He knows he's definitions are a little mushy

344
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,719
But she also says this is just the nature of

345
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
How's the business

346
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,559
He always tell people it's wild simulated now

347
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,351
Matt Wilde when he sells a ginseng

348
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,935
Sometimes he writes it in that very small Prints but she still tells them

349
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
This makes me wonder what someone with a trained eye

350
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
I would say about Larry's

351
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
So

352
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,127
Before I leave I asked him if I can take some with

353
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,199
Larry's already thought of this and he goes out to his truck

354
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
To grab some food

355
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,295
You just pulled out of the ground just now

356
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
Okay

357
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,903
And this has to make to it this is some

358
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,463
This is roughly 14 year old

359
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Root in these beds

360
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
To look at this route

361
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
There's actually not a dealer in the country

362
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
The conseil

363
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
This don't look like wild ginseng

364
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Cuz this looks

365
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
Very much like wild ginseng

366
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,335
Larry also give me an authentic Lee wild ginseng

367
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Kingroot so I

368
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Compare

369
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,943
And he's right they look pretty similar to me

370
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
But it take both routes with

371
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,295
Cuz I want to check with someone that no

372
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
Next I go to Seattle

373
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:29,279
I get back on the freeway heading east to rustbelt town in

374
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:35,679
Pennsylvania called Bethlehem so I just pulled off the freeway the company

375
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
TNA ginseng is based out of the owner's house

376
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,823
It's a big white house up on a hill as chickens outside

377
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,431
And when I park and get to the door I'm greeted by a woman named Nancy

378
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
I like my pasta

379
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
Patrick catc

380
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
Like cats

381
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:03,327
The owner of TNA ginseng is a man named song live

382
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
Very well thanks

383
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,191
I mean him sitting at his kitchen table he's mostly speaking Mandarin

384
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,495
Socassie is Airtel Translate

385
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
We're not even to like it.

386
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
Fun-Lan explains his Disney

387
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
Buy ginseng

388
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,199
Diggers then they cauterize it and make it into capsules

389
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,479
He shows me some of those

390
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,087
Mostly says he sells it to Chinese medicine practitioners inside the U

391
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,439
Salam grew up around a lot of Chinese medicine

392
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487
Petitioners is dad was a doctor

393
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
She prescribed it

394
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
He's been interested in

395
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
His whole life

396
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
He spent 20 years looking at it

397
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
Buying it

398
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
You got a very keen

399
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
Take out the route that I got

400
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:48,639
So actually brought a route with me to do look at it

401
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,943
And just tell me what tell me what you see

402
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
World icon

403
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,319
Fun-Lan asks his daughter to bring over his magnifying glass

404
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
He inspects the route

405
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
Wipe sit down with some water

406
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
Could you ask him what he's looking

407
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:05,279
Looking for a city

408
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583
World icon

409
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
Surprise

410
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
I said

411
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
Consider

412
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:19,103
I'm trying to determine whether this is Moses Cone things in a wild things in

413
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,151
Is it Woods grown or wildin

414
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
Peace Lane said he's looking at the links

415
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,247
Stepinac how close all the way

416
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
Cozaar

417
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
They are

418
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,599
Ultimately if I'm elong says he needs

419
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
City of acre

420
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,439
You wouldn't buy it but you can't be sure how

421
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Then

422
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
I bring out to the other room

423
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
That Larry gave me

424
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,863
This is the one that is actually White

425
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,263
Yesterday's date

426
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
And is immediately evident that

427
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,383
Truly pure wild ginseng

428
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
What's this word is

429
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
It's obvious

430
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
Justin Bieber

431
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
When did Popeye

432
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
Get off of Google

433
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:04,159
So if you have things are looking like this he's willing to pay on $800 pounds

434
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,719
$800 a pound

435
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:13,119
I expected that from Longwood have all these questions

436
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
Where I got the

437
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Xinjiang

438
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,983
From and he does he wanders like it weird

439
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Robot

440
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,823
Doesn't seem to actually matter that much

441
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
What matters

442
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
Is actually just what

443
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
It looks like

444
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
The price

445
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
Really is Bass

446
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
Unjust

447
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
How

448
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Pierce

449
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,855
Wait okay now I'm really confused

450
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
About what is

451
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Wild

452
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,463
Zing saying it's not what it looks like how it was about

453
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
How it's grown

454
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
Yeah that's

455
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
The thing

456
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
Everyone finds it

457
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,655
Which is why when people sell ginseng to

458
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:51,519
To each other the conversation ends up reverting to what they can determine and that is

459
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
What it looks like

460
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
What is right in front of them

461
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,871
Whether the neck is long a

462
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Spindly weather looks

463
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,223
A human man whether the tendrils are long and whiskey

464
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,063
Remember when we were in Chinatown in that thing thing store

465
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:08,415
If we didn't have someone like Fung Lum at our side

466
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:14,047
How could we have known whether we should be shelling out $1,000 an ounce or just $9

467
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
What are the rules

468
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
In a way we can't

469
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,143
Really no

470
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,471
We're showing up three thousand years late to this conversation

471
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,751
23000 years old

472
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,055
Well I went out to Appalachia

473
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
And why I thought I was going to find this

474
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,199
Story that can help me understand what these rules are for the ginseng business but

475
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,855
What ended up stumbling on with thousands of years of culture and history and beliefs about

476
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:44,255
What this route can do and why people are willing to pay it so much for it end

477
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,655
I don't really know if there are any like that in stone rules

478
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,471
Okay but after the break

479
