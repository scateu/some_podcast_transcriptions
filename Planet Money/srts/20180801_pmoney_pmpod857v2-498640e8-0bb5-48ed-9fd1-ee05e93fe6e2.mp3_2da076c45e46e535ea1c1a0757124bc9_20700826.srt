1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:02,304
When a source comes to you

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,584
And says hey

3
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,120
Come out to New Jersey

4
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,400
And I will tell you

5
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:13,056
How about an international price-fixing conspiracy that is giving foreign business has a major advantage of the growing

6
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,080
E-commerce

7
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,128
You have only one choice

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:22,528
We think it's this building yeah it's a Friday afternoon and we're on some

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,088
Being upside Street next to a junkyard

10
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,648
Next toll welding facility in Rahway New

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,672
Jamie

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,208
BJ me

13
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,768
We can be calling our source

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
Jamie

15
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,328
Jamie smaldone

16
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,096
Because

17
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,936
His real name is Jamie smaldone and he does not mind attention at all

18
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,752
Jamie

19
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,800
Jamie spelldown is a ball of a

20
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,616
He's constantly moving or talking

21
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:52,224
One might imagine knocking things over

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,528
The CEO of a company that makes a mug

23
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,320
That is very hard to knock over

24
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,112
It called The Mighty mug

25
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,904
And Jamie demonstrates that

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,744
It works because of some complicated suction cup system and I don't know

27
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
So when you put it down and you knock into it Jimmy is smacking this mug like a toddler so you see that

28
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
It's stuck to the table

29
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,216
But then when you lift it

30
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,008
Oh my God what

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:20,384
Few years ago Jamie started to notice that knockoff Mighty Muggs were popping up

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,152
All over the

33
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,712
Okay so I have all them here

34
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,480
I have a bunch of them

35
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,344
Hey Jamie is running off every great conspiracy theorist has a moment of Revelation

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
And Jamie's came from a plastic mug

37
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,232
Specifically a red knockoff Mighty mug

38
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
That he is now returning with

39
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
So this is this is

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
Where did you get the smoke

41
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,144
So I bought that particular one on eBay

42
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,960
For $5.69

43
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,288
Free shipping from China maybe you've noticed this

44
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
As well you can go on eBay or AliExpress

45
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,944
You can buy a mug or a like a phone charger

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,528
It comes from all the way across the world with free shipping

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
And the whole thing costs

48
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,624
Next to nothing it is dirt cheap

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,392
And this

50
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,672
Does not make sense

51
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,976
Shirt maybe you can make the stuff

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
The Milling across oceans

53
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
Certainly must be

54
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,400
And this is what Jamie was thinking when that red knock-off mug arrived

55
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
That is office like

56
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,704
How did this

57
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
Sing

58
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
Get here

59
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
For $5.69

60
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
Total cost

61
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
Who returns to its shipping guy

62
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
Any ask

63
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,688
How much would it cost

64
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
For us just to ship this mug

65
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
Like not across the ocean

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
Just across the street

67
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
He told me

68
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
It's going to cost us about

69
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
6:30

70
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
Text to ship this item

71
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,720
Across the street

72
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Across the street

73
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
Yeah and you say what

74
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,352
Is a direct quote

75
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,912
Without that Jamie is that his business is in

76
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
Deep trouble

77
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
Because somehow

78
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,312
His competitors can manufacture and deliver a mug

79
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,616
4 Less Than Jamie pays just a ship

80
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:01,760
Jamie smaldone has been telling anyone who will listen that something is wrong with International ship

81
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,088
He showed up at his local post office demanding answers he

82
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,904
Send a 15-page letter to the White House

83
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,464
Send a bunch of messages to us at Planet Money

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
And he says

85
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,048
He has finally figured out what is going on

86
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,632
There is a secretive International Organization

87
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
The get-together

88
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
To fix the price

89
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
Global ship

90
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,776
And it's screwing over American small

91
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
I knew I knew

92
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
It was like

93
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
The universe opened up to me

94
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,688
If you go back and you look at my messages too

95
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,504
Like I saw how everything was going to play out

96
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,600
Are you aware that when you say these kinds of things

97
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:43,232

The first rule of conspiracy theory reporting

119
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,887
Is do not get all your information from the guy in New Jersey yelling at the top of his

120
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,495
Luckily we found one of the few experts on International postal policy

121
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
A guy named Jim camp

122
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591

Oh yeah there is absolutely a group

Postal policy

133
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351

Part of the United Nation

141
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:39,199
And it's made up of representatives from the Postal Services of 192

142

Basically the UPS of the secret

147
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Yai

148
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,911

00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
We should warn you

00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,055
If you are operating heavy equipment right now or if you're on the road

152
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
Open the window

I mean maybe we should do this as a

189
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
More like a hypothetical

190
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
The situation so let's say you send us a pack

191
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Where in New York City

192
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
Shipping to us from Burn

193
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Okay

194
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
What's the specialty of burn is there any what should you send as chocolate no chocolate I would not send to you

195
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,967
You because it's a perishable and it's not accepting the post stream

196
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,855
I would send you a cell phone

197
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
Let us take a breath

198
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
And appreciate

199
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
The man-made miracle

200
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
That is international mail

201
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
Alta mercante

202
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,839
This hypothetical cell phone to his local Swiss

203
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
Buy Swiss postage

204
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,751
And it will show up on our doorstep in New York he doesn't have to think about it

205
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:16,895
He doesn't have to tell Swiss post what route to take he doesn't have to buy u.s. postage or French postage

206
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,711
Did your postage of any other country that are cellphone my pass through

207
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
No

208
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
And this

209
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
Is because

210
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
Cue the boring sound

211
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,671
On functions secretive group of boring male people have boring meetings

212
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,487
Any work out the rules to make international mail

213
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,303
Okay so now for the problematic

214
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,631
Are cell phone is in the hands of the Swiss

215
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
At least burn

216
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
I fly to the United States

217
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,103
Probably to JFK Airport during this movement there is a moment where the international items

218
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
The mix

219
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
With the domestic item

220
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,735
And it is at that moment the cell phone switches hands

221
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
It's from the Swiss post

222
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
To the United States Postal

223
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
And USPS will finish what's known as

224
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
The final mile

225
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
The important thing here

226
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,743
Is that this final mile of the journey

227
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
Is generally the most

228
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Expensive part of the

229
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
As in

230
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,143
It accounts for the majority of the cost

231
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
I'm getting that cell phone

232
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,983
From a foreign post office to our door

233
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:19,615
Because it's pretty expensive to send someone in a truck or walking down the street to deliver

234
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
Something by half

235
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
That's the idea

236
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:28,319
Yo it's somehow it's more labor-intensive when you when it comes to delivery

237
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,623
Then in other parts of the

238
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Of the process

239
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
This creates

240
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
A problem

241
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
The USPS

242
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Got stuck

243
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,327
With the expensive part of delivery of our cell phone

244
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,143
But they did not get any of Ultimate Ears money

245
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
He paid Swiss

246
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
And when the abuse started they figured

247
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
Let's not worry about

248
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,799
We all know the final mile

249
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Is super expensive

250
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,383
Pensive but we're all send each other mail will all take

251
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Turns eating the cost

252
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
Of that lousy final

253
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
It'll all even out

254
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
But come on

255
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
This is like going out to eat with

256
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
With a group of friends

257
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
And saying let's just put the check

258
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
But then you have that one friend

259
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Call of Duty

260
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
Chris Godwin

261
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
Keeps ordering expensive beers

262
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
I'm here drinking water

263
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,351
And this is certainly not going to split evenly anyways

264
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,911
Yes this problem happened with International

265
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,751
Some countries were getting flooded with foreign male but we're barely sending

266
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Which meant

267
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,103
Their Postal Service was getting stuck doing more final miles then

268
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
For the last five decades

269
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
The GPU has been trying to

270
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
Fix this by saying

271
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Hey

272
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,647
Let's start reimbursing each other for that final mile but in general they still have a gentleman's agreement where they do

273
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
Don't pay each other back the full cup

274
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
And this is really important

275
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,583
Because there is still country is getting screwed because they're delivering a lot of packages

276
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,375
And eating some of the cost

277
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
We wanted to know

278
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Who is winning

279
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
And who is losing it

280
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
And so we asked ultimate Linares

281
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Can we see

282
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,127
How much it cost to send packages around the world

283
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
And also

284
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
How much countries reimburse

285
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
Is there a place

286
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,319
Just to like to see what these numbers are

287
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:10,207
No this alright considered sensitive data so it's not supposed to be

288
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
Open to the public

289
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
Why not it seems like

290
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,327
Good information to have is a Custer

291
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:20,959
Really well it could be but I've never seen this happening I don't know for example

292
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:27,359
What Walmart would be painted their franchisees or McDonald's for

293
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,199
For example intercompany intercompany data

294
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,503
These are not corporations are like

295
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
Arms of government

296
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:43,231
I understand you'll be needing this may be a better point

297
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,559
The first moment we really started to feel like Jamie small town

298
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
Are New Jersey mug maker

299
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,911
Was not just feeding us some conspiracy Mumbo

300
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Because

301
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,263
There is a secret ish postal Society

302
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,567
They are getting together

303
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
And they're agreeing

304
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,919
To give each other special below-market shipping

305
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
Which brings us

306
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
To the final part

307
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
Jamie's postal Theory of Everything

308
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,183
America and American small businesses are somehow getting screwed by this postal Illuminati

309
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
Ultimate was like

310
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
I just work

311
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
At the U P

312
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,047
It's up to the members whether or not

313
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,119
They want to share intimate postal details with you

314
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
You guys are American

315
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,727
Why don't you just ask the United States Post

316
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
We did

317
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
They will neither confirm nor deny our interview

318
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
You request so

319
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,431
We did what we always do at Planet Money yeah we call them,

320
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,015
Would you say you're the foremost postal economist

321
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
In the world

322
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,647
Maybe I wouldn't drag it that far but finally I would say

323
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:49,791
This is Anna Muller bovie but I think that's too difficult for you

324
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
A few years ago the United States

325
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,399
Postal Regulatory Commission wanted to know what we want to know

326
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,751
Who's winning and who's losing in the CPU system they hired Honest Company

327
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
An economics Consulting

328
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Confirm

329
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
Do a bunch of studies

330
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
Inanna tells us

331
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,407
In fact for a long time

332
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
The United States with a big

333
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,479
Time winner in this

334
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,807
We were a big economy exporting lots of

335
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,367
But also exploding a lot of Ino

336
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Mail

337
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Why

338
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
Ymail what are we sending

339
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
You're sending you

340
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
Catalogs letters documents

341
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
Marketing material

342
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,679
Yeah I junk mail this was great for the United

343
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,775
We were making other countries postal people do the

344
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,079
Expensive part of delivering stuff

345
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,895
And because of you. We didn't have to pay them back for it all

346
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,967
Sure when someone from another country send a package to

347
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
If you ask

348
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,807
We had to deliver their stuff and not get fully reimbursed

349
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
But on the whole

350
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
There weren't as many packages and letters coming in

351
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
As we were sending out

352
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
And this we actually do have number

353
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
8 years ago

354
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,071
The US was making money off this imbalance

355
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
Teletoon

356
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,423
Of 275 million dollars per

357
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,959
But then

358
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
The e

359
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:06,591
Email Matt less need for international letters but more importantly

360
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
E-commerce meant that

361
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
American started ordering stuff direct from other

362
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Slowly

363
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
Slowly slowly

364
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
And sister Nita Justino escalated

365
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,879
More and more stuff came into the United

366
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
And then

367
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
3 years ago

368
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
A big

369
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
Switch flip

370
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
The first time we were losers

371
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,119
We started to lose money on the mail delivery in Bala

372
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,727
Last year the US Postal Service lost around 80 million dollars

373
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
And it's almost certainly going to be worse this year because

374
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,639
We are almost certainly ordering more stuff from overseas

375
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,199
Butter mug maker Jamie does not care

376
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
If the USPS

377
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
Is losing money

378
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
The claim he made

379
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,831
In the claim honestly we were most skeptic

380
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Glove

381
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,671
Is it this system is actually made it cheaper

382
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,487
To ship a mug into the United States

383
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
From China

384
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Send to send a mug across the

385
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,119
We're in this past every person we talked

386
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
Including animals

387
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,239
Can I tell you the the the little story that

388
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
It kind of started this whole thing

389
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Sure

390
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
So

391
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
There's this guy who makes mug

392
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:17,503
You know Jamie

393
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,087
You can't knock it over it's very high I saw the YouTube clip

394
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
She didn't however know Jamie's Holst

395
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
So we told her about how Jamie was looking

396
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,999
Inferno cost and how it appeared to Cost Less to ship

397
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,583
Amug into United States from China than it did to ship them out

398
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,655
Across the street that story Rings true to you

399
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Very much

400
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,215
And so it is possible

401
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,263
That shipping something from

402
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
China

403
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
Is cheaper

404
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
Then shipping something to your Neighbor Next Door

405
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
Yeah price-wise called twice no

406
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
Meaning of course it cost

407
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,015
A lot of money to ship something for

408
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
From China

409
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,623
But because of these artificially low upu reimbursement rate

410
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,207
The actual price for China Post is wailer

411
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,023
Honesty is a chart that estimates how much

412
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
And it says

413
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
If you or I wanted to send

414
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
A 3/4 pound package

415
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
Somewhere in the US

416
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
The US Postal Service

417
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,519
Would charge around $4.76

418
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
For the last leg of the

419
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
Yeah the so-called final mile

420
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
However

421
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,943
If that same package came in from China

422
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
The USPS would only charge China Post

423
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
Dollars 39

424
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,623
That means the USPS charges you and me

425
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
Roughly three and a half

426
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,487
Times more than what they charge China Post

427
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Yes

428
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,815
But you get how crazy it is

429
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Baidu

430
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,935
I do it i mean this is a system which totally askew

431
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,239
Excuse the market market function

432
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
What do you view has created

433
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
It's almost like

434
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
Over verse trade barrier

435
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,503
Like why would I buy something that ships from the US

436
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,551
When the US Postal Service

437
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,599
Is essentially subsidizing shipping

438
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
From China

439
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
And this is true

440
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,975
For virtually every country in the world there

441
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
Is often an incentive

442
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
To buy something that

443
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Ships

444
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
From another country instead of your own

445
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
And that

446
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
Anna says

447
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
Beans that upu has been

448
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,007
Quietly changing the flow

449
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
At the global economy

450
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,591
When you think about this system

451
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
How do you feel about

452
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
Computer in a

453
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
Economics

454
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
Point of view

455
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
It's distorting pricing

456
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,879
That's how I would you know put it from a purely

457
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
Theoretical

458
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
And then of course it's a human

459
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,303
I feel frustration that is going on

460
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,887
What does buy a lot of things

461
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
Online

462
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,471
Crappy things that we shouldn't have bought otherwise

463
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,287
It also means you know a lot for the environment

464
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
If we

465
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
UShip a lot of things

466
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
Bye-bye airplane or you don't even vote for

467
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,967
But it said just bigger than

468
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
No money

469
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,063
And so this brings us to the final part

470
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
Of Jamie smaldones

471
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,975
The price-fixing postal Illuminati are screwing over American small pill

472
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,023
And so

473
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,071
I think we can say

474
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
This is

475
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,727
Arguably true especially if most of your customers

476
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
Learn the United States

477
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,079
Jamie is shipping is mugs around the

478
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
And the USPS

479
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,919
Is giving a better deal to China Post

480
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Then it is

481
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,759
In other words Nick I think what you're saying is

482
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,087
A posse of powerful postal people

483
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,391
Are playing with parcel prices

484
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,231
Proliferating pandemonium and potentially Prime profits

485
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
Former protagonist

486
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
A patriotic producer

487
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
Of portable plastic

488
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Pouring Prada

489
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Precisely

490
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
After the break

491
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
Mcall

492
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
Poor Jamie

493
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
And tell him he was right all along

494
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,431

Hey Jamie yep how's it going it's Nick and Kenny hey what's up guys how are you

503
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
So we know it's been a long time since we talked

504
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
I actually thought you

505
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
You forgot about

506
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,295
Yeah we never stopped looking into it

507
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:40,415
I mean I guess I should say Jamie when we first met you and when you told us

508
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
This expansive Theory

509
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,559
Beside you sounded like a little Looney

510
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Riot

511
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
I knew how you were going to

512
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
View the whole

513
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
I mean

514
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,055
I think it's fair to say Nick that like

515
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,103
Everything Jamie told us

516
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Is

517
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
Like true

518
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,919
Checks out

519
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
That makes me feel good

520
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,271
Could you guys know I was harassing you

521
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
Before we met

522
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Yeah

523
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:15,999
We're about to lose the studio it was awesome talking with you

524
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,375
Emailed you it's incredible story

525
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:28,031
All right man I mean like okay thank you so much okay alright guy

526
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
All right

527
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,639
Do you know of a conspiracy theory that is not just

528
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:38,271
The theory is true if so email has Planet Money on NPR. Org or all the social media

529
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,135
Are supervising producer is Alex goldmark and our editor is Brian first.

530
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,439
I'm the fountain and I'm Kenny Malone

531
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
Thanks for listening

532
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
And one last thing

533
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,607
When we were visiting Jamie and testing his mighty mug

534
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,399
You did mention this one thing

535
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
You saying I can't spell this

536
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:03,359
This is a challenge you have to hit it with about six or seven pounds of pressure eventually anything hit

537
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
Will dislodge

538
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:11,551
Fast forward month later to this studio which has a lot of expensive equipment in it

539
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
Kenny

540
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,135
Bottom buddy mug and apparently forgot to list

541
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,952
They don't spell

542
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:24,352
That's too hard
