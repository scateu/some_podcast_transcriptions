00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,560
Every week at Planet Money we have

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:03,328
Restoring meeting

3
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:06,656
We're supposed to be pitching ideas of stories that we wanted to

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,192
But a lot of the time

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:11,520
We just end up talking about stories that other people have done

6
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:15,104
Stories that are so brilliant and so perfect

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,128
Did we just

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,176
Throw up our hands and see

9
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,224
Why didn't I think of that

10
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,016
And then we move on

11
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,576
But but one day a year

12
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,600
We do not

00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368

34
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,440
Jacob Goldstein Jacob

35
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
Mario time is

36
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,304
The story that appeared on the front page of the Wall Street Journal on

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,096
Say on October 19th

38
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Mm

39
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
16

40
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
Headline

41
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
What does Nevada

42
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,008
35 billion dollar fund manager do all day

43
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,800
Nothing

44
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,104
You know I didn't I didn't love the

45
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
He does nothing all day

46
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:57,504
Title of the article of course it all my coworkers are telling me to get to work

47
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,528
That is

48
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Steve Edmonds

49
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:04,160
He is the manager for the pension fund for Nevada state employees

50
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,512
And that's heavilin on the story it's a joke about this investing strategy

51
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
Call passive man

52
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
And it's sort of become

53
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,400
All the rage you know the traditional style of managing money

54
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
This is true

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
For like a mutual funds for ordinary people's retirement funds but also for big Pension funds

56
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
The traditional style is

57
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
Active

58
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
And that is basically

59
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,920
You pay someone who's like really smart

60
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
Studies the market to like

61
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
Pick stocks and bonds

62
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
That they think are going to do

63
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
Guide your passive management is

64
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
That is a waste of money

65
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,184
But those people are not worth the money you're paying them

66
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
And you're better off

67
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
Not paying them and just more less buying all of this

68
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
And all of the bond

69
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
And not trying to

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
And so if your job is just buy all the stocks

71
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
You don't have to spend all day BMI

72
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
I'm going to research this one.

73
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,544
Call the company you just buy ammo

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
And the genius of this

75
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
Story from the

76
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
The journal is

77
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
It captures

78
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,480
This whole sort of idea of passive man

79
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
In the form of this one

80
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
Person of

81
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
Steve Edmond

82
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,904
You've liked the embodiment of passive men

83
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
You know he manages a lot of

84
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,768
As of this morning 36

85
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
Point six billion in assets

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,936
36.6 and I picture like

87
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
Udo Giant

88
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,032
Midtown Manhattan office would like a ridiculous sense

89
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
Parkview

90
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,152
A little one story building in Carson City Nevada

91
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
Got a little office and I almost get a view of the mountains not quite

92
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
Looking at the office building

93
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:42,464
He drives an old car hits its a 2005 Honda Element

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,256
So there's all these delightful details about him

95
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
In the story

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,096
But there's also I think this interesting idea here which is

97
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
You know

98
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:56,288
It is it is really contrary to human nature to like look at some massive news event or whatever be like

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,152
I think that the human instinct is to

100
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
Constantly Act

101
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
So what is he doing

102
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
Well okay so yeah

103
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
Kiki doesn't do nothing

104
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,808
Think of you please not like Trading

105
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
But you know

106
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,648
He basically has to sort of just to manage the check

107
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Book of the funds you don't like

108
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
Employees are

109
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
Contributing intuitive

110
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,791
Make sure their money you don't get that out into the stock market

111
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
Retirees need to get paid

112
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
Truly doing nothing

113
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
He's just not trading my

114
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,799
And I should say the piece in the drill it's just a really lovely little story really nicely

115
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
The reporter who wrote it was Timothy W mark

116
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
Take a piece of grass

117
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,479
Yeah I know I'm getting paid by the hour. All day man

118
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
CrossFit poster

119
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,695
So my Valentine is something that Jacob I know you love to its it goes out to the obituaries

120
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
Section of The Economist magazine

121
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,999
I love it

122
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
So much

123
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,631
Run one obituary every week at the back of the magazine sometimes someone famous

124
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,191
Sometimes it's someone I've never heard of

125
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
And I wanted to know who

126
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Who writes Ozark

127
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,615
Obituaries so I thought it would be some like very Grim serious buttoned-up dude

128
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:08,991
And I was completely wrong because everybody likes of The Economist is that have that in your mind right

129
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,575
It is actually this woman named Dan Rowe and she's not buttoned-up

130
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:18,207
Just lovely I said one you I've got a code saying I'm holding it at Bay

131
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,559
What it might Southern sexy or it might just sound you cranky

132
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,375
Give me a little about her writing is something that I think is

133
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
Is true of all great writer

134
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,239
You read something by her and even if her name's not on it

135
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
You know it's her

136
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,615
To my favorite obituary from the past year that she did was of Prince

137
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
I love

138
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,199
Prince so I must have read about 10 Prince obit

139
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Fairies

140
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
And here's what most of them early

141
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,551
Like this is this is a real one

142
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
And it starts

143
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:49,951
Prince the songwriter singer producer One Man Studio band and consummate Showman

144
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
Died on Thursday at his home Paisley Park

145
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
In Chanhassen Minnesota

146
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
He was 50 Cent

147
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,119
So that is a typical obituary

148
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,215
But and obit in The Economist starts out talking about

149
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Freedom

150
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
I asked her to read her opening

151
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
So sexy freedom

152
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,639
So sexy he couldn't begin to explain it

153
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,431
So sexy, freedom

154
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
Free to put on mascara

155
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,063
Painted lips glue on long eyelashes

156
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
Tulo aflutter and seduce

157
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
Stratton Ruffles

158
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
Squeeze in black leather

159
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
Praying his naked midriff

160
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
Shake his naked ass out of yellow gems

161
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,143
Maybe that's it

162
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
More

163
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,239
It's okay

164
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
What what are

165
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,503
Here's what she told me she said first thing is she will get her assignment on a Thursday

166
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
And that point she only has

167
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
36 hours

168
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
To turn this thing off

169
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Sushi gets raped

170
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
My first port-of-call is

171
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,487
The London Library which is just around the corner from here

172
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Luckily

173
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
And I raced there and

174
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
I see if my subject has written

175
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
What's a biography

176
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,471
Do you realize that yourself

177
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,799
Now I try to look at myself otherwise I mean

178
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:14,943
If I don't go who knows what they might miss do you know yours you got to you got to get yourself anyways send you the right in the corner

179
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
Givenchy goes online

180
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,063
My Google Google Google I cannot say like Google

181
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623
Strange things with the name

182
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,951
You know if I was Googling prints I might Google Print

183
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
Menchie's

184
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
So none of this seems

185
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Strange or Secret

186
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
Crimson cheese

187
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,119
That's something

188
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
I think she told me

189
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
The secret partner

190
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Secret Santa

191
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,055
She is not really interested in what other people have to

192
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
To say about her subject

193
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,919
Their friends their co-workers their family

194
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
She doesn't usually talk to those p

195
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
She only wants to

196
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,807
To hear what the person she's profiling has

197
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
To say about themselves

198
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
That's best

199
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:59,487
Rad wait a minute and then she feels like she can hear their voices in her head

200
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
So she sits at her desk and she

201
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,327
Choose our pain and she channels

202
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
Like she's actually writing in their voice

203
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,959
You trying to get the human soul I really believe in this

204
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,287
And therefore what I think I'm doing is

205
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
Catching Souls end

206
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
That's an almost impossible business

207
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
TBN

208
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,735
And I think that's the reason that she's so memorable and so extraordinary because

209
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
When she writes

210
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
She's actually becoming someone else

211
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Genius

212
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
Damn right

213
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
All right

214
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,559
That mean you want me to leave now

215
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
All right

216
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
Hey Nick fountain

217
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
Who's your Valentine

218
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
My Valentine

219
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,663
Goes out to a music video director

220
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
His name is Ryan Stack

221
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:57,599
And he made only one video that I've ever seen it is a music video for the atlanta-based rapper

222
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Young Thug

223
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
I know out the reason I love this video

224
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
Because of what I do every

225
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,023
Right I'm a producer here at Planet Money

226
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,583
And what I do largely is like

227
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,911
Reporter wrangling and guests wrangling and

228
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,263
Making sure that all the right elements for podcast are in the right place

229
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,567
At the right time right now

230
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
And sometimes

231
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,943
That delicate choreography just goes all wrong

232
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,015
And Ryan Stack my Valentine the music video director

233
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,575
Took one of these disastrous production days

234
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
Just the worst I've ever heard of

235
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
And made it into something brilliant

236
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
The the first moment I realized things were

237
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,351
Kind of you not going according to plan and going south is probably that that first shot

238
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
The reason things were going south

239
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
Is because Young Thug the star of the video was not there

240
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,519
Which undermines the entire point of a music video

241
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
Right beside things

242
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,823
No worries

243
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
At 11 a.m.

244
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
We got time we can do

245
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Deschutes summer

246
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Establishing shots

247
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
And when Young Thug arrives

248
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
We can shoot him

249
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
In those places and

250
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Edit him in

251
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Impost

252
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,879
And then from there it just got worse and worse and worse

253
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
Toast

254
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
All day long

255
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,511
He's shooting scenes of this young thug video

256
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
Without Young Thug

257
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
And keep in mind he'd hired a huge

258
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
Screw head blocked off

259
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
The street

260
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,727
He's a little nervous but he's like I'm going to make this work

261
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
She keeps shooting

262
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
And then

263
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
The sun goes down

264
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Openstack is like

265
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,455
I've spent $75,000 already

266
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,527
I just got to get one shot of Young Thug

267
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
Sing the lyrics to this song

268
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
If I can be pretty

269
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
But I'm going to make it work

270
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
And then

271
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,255
After 10 hours of shooting pulled up and we thought he was going to be

272
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,583
Coming up shortly to be part of the scene and then

273
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
Yeah awesome feeling

274
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
And then he did not come out of the car

275
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
I have nothing that they have

276
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Absolutely

277
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
It's just a nightmare

278
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,639
It's absolutely a night

279
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Stack is like

280
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,503
This is the worst day ever he's driving back to the hotel

281
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
Annies with somebody from his crew and

282
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
But he's just like repeating it over and over in his head

283
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
Yeah I would just like

284
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,207
Mention something in the she like me and it sucks when you know

285
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,279
Bob what happened and he be like yeah that that sucked

286
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,071
And I'd like to be quiet for a while and be like

287
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
Internet part 1

288
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,655
You know he didn't get out of the cartoon that suck

289
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Guy was bad

290
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:26,591
And it's just like how like repeating the same the obvious stuff over and over like almost in the days

291
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
But the reason we're here today Noel

292
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
Is because stack made something anyways

293
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
It's right he made

294
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
A music video

295
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,575
About making a music video where the artist

296
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,879
Featured in the music video

297
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
Hasn't showed up for the music

298
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
I want to play it

299
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Perfect

300
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Here it is

301
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
So so far

302
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
Standard music video models

303
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
Cars yeah but then

304
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,495
There's like the subtitles like at the foreign language film

305
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
But it's just he's like

306
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:00,383
Passive-aggressive commentaries on the day so this first one is

307
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,991
Young Thug didn't show up in time for that shot

308
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,807
Holy calling about and the next one says

309
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
In fact

310
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,183
She never showed up for any of our shop

311
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:21,375
And then it got better he has like these little outlines of where Young Thug should be sitting in a shot

312
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,447
And it's the producer me who loved this

313
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
Because

314
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
You just made

315
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
This beautiful thing

316
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Out of nothing

317
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,615
And that's something we all aspire to

318
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:36,991
Alright Nick sound thank you so much one more things I reached out to Young Thug people for comment

319
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
He has not gotten back

320
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:44,671
You maybe you will by sundell

321
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,031
Next up is a quick one from Alex

322
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Chick-fil-A

323
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,151
My Planet Money Valentine goes out to someone named Ernie

324
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Because he is a

325
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,223
Connoisseur of the Monday

326
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
He is an expert in

327
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Boredom

328
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
He runs a newsletter called tedium

329
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,903
What he obsesses over boring things until they become

330
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
He writes these

331
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
Long post filled with details

332
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
Where he digs up old patent filing

333
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,863
Clippings from hundred-year-old newspapers archival audio

334
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
Just goes

335
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
So not

336
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
And I love it

337
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
So I called them up and I asked him about some of his face

338
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,055
I did a really great one about

339
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
Suck the issue with umbrella patent

340
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,919
I was titled when it rains it pours

341
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,527
Inventors keep coming up with new ideas for umbrellas but consumers don't ever buy them they just

342
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,879
I did one on the history of ranch dressing a while ago which was

343
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
Very much

344
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,999
I would say a personal interest in mind

345
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,327
It really is from a ranch and it really was called hitting the

346
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,959
The history of fingernail clippers and how we put their fingernails before we had fingernail clippers

347
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,751
So many ways one device

348
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Was

349
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
Kind of like an apple peeler and it's

350
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
Terrifying in

351
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
And no

352
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,455
Ernie Smith Never claims that these posts are important

353
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:17,087
But he sees what he's doing is it kind of antidote to the firehose of tiny updates and breathlessness

354
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
Tedium

355
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
The newsletter

356
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
I want to check it out thanks Alex you got it

357
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,215
Alright next up is our editor Bryan tour

358
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
Hey

359
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
This is the first time you've been on air

360
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
This is the first time I've ever been on

361
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
A podcast

362
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Awesome

363
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
Well we're happy to have you end

364
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,503
Who is your Valentine

365
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,319
So I'm going to tell you how I found out about my valentine

366
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,207
My first my son came home one day and he was like Dad can we get a trampoline weight how old is your son

367
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
11

368
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
So

369
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,607
It doesn't make sense because we live in a tiny little apartment and it's only like 6 foot from wall to wall

370
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
And I don't think he's ever seen a trampoline

371
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:08,799
So there's no possible way we get a trampoline and I didn't know what he was talking about and I just sort of wrote it off and I said no we can't get it

372
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
And then he came home another day and he said

373
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
Can you take me to store so we can get some

374
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
Spiking gel

375
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,807
Spiking for his hair to spike it up straight

376
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,879
Animes like 11 okay

377
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Okay

378
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
We can do that

379
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,791
And then he came home a third time and we were just sort of sitting quietly and he said

380
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
Can we move to Kansas

381
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
And I said

382
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Kansas

383
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,191
Why and he said cuz that's where Tanner braungardt lives

384
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
And Tanner braungardt is a YouTube Star

385
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
Since he's about 7 he's been chronicling

386
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
Kind of his whole life

387
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
On YouTube

388
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,919
He makes these inventive little skits and videos and

389
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,247
Kind of has created a whole little entertainment Empire this just him and his friends

390
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,807
Is 2 million fans

391
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:57,183
Mostly like my son who just loved everything he doesn't have spiky hair and want trampolines

392
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
I got AT&T team

393
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:03,327
And he has made Kansas seem like the most interesting place you could possibly live

394
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
And

395
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,679
I am jealous of him because I think he's a person who has

396
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,031
Kind of founder figured out a new art form that didn't exist

397
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
Even just a few years ago

398
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
And he's done what

399
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:22,015
A person does with art which is take the mundane and the normal and the stuff that we think is too uninteresting to be excited about

400
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,087
10 made into something that everyone else wants to be a part of

401
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Am I

402
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,671
I'm kind of jealous of that cuz I wish I was like that too

403
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:34,815
You wish you were an artist or you wish I wish I wish I wish I had that everything but I wish I had that sense of how to

404
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
How to transform

405
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,423
Just regular life into special life

406
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
Very cool

407
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
Okay Bryant one last thing before you leave

408
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:48,639
We should say that we stole the conceit of this show from the place that you used to work Bloomberg business

409
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
That's right over there we called it the jealousy list

410
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
And I

411
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
In some ways I think that was

412
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,783
Maybe a better name

413
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Because

414
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
These are Valentine's here but

415
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
They're also about

416
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,415
Jealousy and envy which is

417
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
Which is like

418
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,023
One of the seven sins and it's like a serious feeling and we would get it and we would want to

419
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,071
Beatles people and have done the things they do

420
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,911
Alright thanks Brian I hope your first podcast appearance was fun

421
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,567
I am exhausted I have to go right now

422
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,479
Okay one last item it comes from Planet Money producer Sally helm

423
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,295
Until yours has to do is straight-up jealousy

424
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
Yes

425
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,647
My Valentine goes out to a website that I

426
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Called

427
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,487
And what is reductress

428
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,047
Reductress is a satirical women's mag

429
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
Magazine

430
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:44,447
It's like the onion meets Cosmo I went down to the doctors offices a few days ago and I talked to

431
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
Three ladies there they are Beth Newell

432
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,567
Sarah pappalardo and Nicole silverberg

433
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
Stay at the site

434
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871

435
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,431
A big job is coming up with funny

436
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Headlines

437
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
Which

438
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,551
Noel I think you maybe could agree we need a little help

439
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
The headline

440
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
They are not our strong suit

441
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,207
Why don't you come up with to get a butt

442
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
The thing is it takes us

443
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279

444
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303

445
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,631
Atlanta money we tend to spend like

446
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:20,287
3 hours on a Friday afternoon just trying to come up with the headline for the one episode that we have to put out that day

447
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
How many headlights do you guys come up with everyday

448
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,151

450
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,479
So I have a question

451
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,783
For you we are doing a

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
Show that is annual tuition for us

453
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
It's our jealousy show

454
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,975
It specifically about professional jealousy so jealousy of other people's work

455
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,095
If you were to come up with a headline for that episode

456
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
What would you call it

457
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,799
Oh my God I'm so happy for you oh my God I'm

458
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
