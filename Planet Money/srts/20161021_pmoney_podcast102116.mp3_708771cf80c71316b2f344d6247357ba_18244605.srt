1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,840
I talked with a doctor in Venezuela the other day

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:04,608
Neurosurgeon

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,680
He's been working in the public hospitals in Caracas

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,704
For free

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,776
And recently he just

6
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:12,800
Had to quit

7
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,104
The conditions in the public Hospital

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,384
We're getting to Danger

9
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,224
I I didn't want to jeopardize anybody's life

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,760
Because of being responsive

11
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,064
I'm sure you've heard about the situation

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,088
In Venezuela right now

13
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,136
It's in the midst of this economic

14
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
Prices

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,696
Claps is probably a better word

16
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,000
There's almost no food on the shelves

17
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,768
The supermarket

18
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,792
Guitar riot

19
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,352
Inflation is estimated at 500%

20
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,400
And there are these rolling blackouts

21
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
Across the city

22
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,472
Which is a bad thing for neurosurgeon

23
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,568
I know colleagues who actually have ended their operation

24
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,104
With a flashlight that comes

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,872
In the cell phone

26
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,152
They've use that for

27
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
For surgery

28
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
Oh yeah 2

29
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,480
At at least to close a patient

30
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,552
It is inconceivable how they operate Hospital

31
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
In Venezuela

32
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,856
But they do

33
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,904
They just plant around the blackouts

34
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,720
And the water outages no water for hours at at

35
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
The time

36
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
And if you live in Caracas

37
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,072
And you have to go to the hospital you know

38
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,144
You should probably bring everything from home

39
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,424
There is essentially

40
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,728
Nothing there there no gloss

41
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,264
There no sutures

42
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Patient has

43
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,848
To bring their own food their own gases

44
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384
They have to bring their own

45
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
Food to the hospital

46
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
Absolutely

47
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,504
In in most of the hospitals there is not even

48
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Food for the

49
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,368
Okay that yeah it is as dramatic as it sounds

50
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,952
Infant mortality is rising up 20% from last year

51
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,744
Diseases like tuberculosis

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
Malaria are coming

53
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,120
And the neurosurgeon says he would walk to the quarters the hospital

54
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
And see patients just

55
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,192
Lying on the floor on blankets

56
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,984
And I'm mattresses they brought from home

57
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,288
If you could even imagine

58
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
A war zone Hospital

59
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
This is even worse

60
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Why

61
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,224
Because in a war you actually

62
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
Either didn't

63
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
Planet

64
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,552
You know it was something

65
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,832
That exploded

66
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,624
Happened was unpredictable

67
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,928
But this is something that could have been

68
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Avoid

69
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,744
Long time ago with the rice

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Political and economical

71
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,168
Venezuela designed their own collapse

72
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,360
Hello and welcome to Planet Money on Robert Smith

73
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,176
Venezuela used to be a relatively rich

74
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,736
Country it had money and prestige

75
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
And most importantly had oil

76
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,880
Venezuelans used to brag that they have the largest reserves of oil in the world

77
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:40,768
Today on the show we have an economic Horror Story what a country that made all the wrong decisions

78
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Boil

80

A decade ago Venezuela was riding

89
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,920
So high it sweeter felt that he could take on United

90
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
States of America

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
This was Hugo Chavez

92
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,552
Former revolutionary but he had been elected president

93
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,952
Venezuela and how do you remember this in 2006 he came here to New York talk at the United Nations

94
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,768
President George Bush and just spoken at the UN the day before

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
Java stands there and he says

96
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
Baidu

97
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:53,984
The devil

98
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
This part of total street map

99
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,312
Baby crosses himself

100
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
He makes prayer hands

101
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
How many waves waiting says

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
I can still

103
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
Willie a suit for a Terraria

104
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,064
And everybody cracked up except

105
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
Probably George Bush

106
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
But it was kind of funny right

107
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,232
Back in those days Hugo Chavez made a sport of straight up

108
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
Trolling the United

109
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
Whenever you could

110
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
He would point out

111
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,863
How terribly the US was treating

112
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
It's poor

113
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
And how sad it

114
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
We

115
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
Venezuelan people

116
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
Loves you

117
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,823
We went I went to Bijou Brothers

118
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,895
And then he makes the people of the United States and offer

119
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,479
Venezuela has so much money and so much oil

120
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,575
We're going to give discounted heating oil to poor people in the US

121
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:47,231
The Venezuelan State owns an oil company and they prove it Citgo and they put out a bunch of ads in Boston and New York

122
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,631
Featuring Joe Kennedy

123
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
The United States

124
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:01,055
Look it up we are Venezuela We are the champions of the World by Joe Kennedy help is on the way heating oil

125
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,895
What's 40% off from our friends and Venezuela at Citgo

126
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Mrs.

127
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
Google Java Style

128
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
Alright he uses oil money

129
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
YouTube I love

130
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
Listen to buy Power

131
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,367
The foundation for the collapse started as it always does

132
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
During the

133
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Boomers

134
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,743
Travis wasn't big into saving any with oil money

135
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Before

136
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
The day when it will run out

137
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,631
He was a socialist with a populist he wanted to spend

138
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
The money

139
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
Especially on programs for

140
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
Food subsidies

141
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,847
No education programs pretty much I was a time of economic Bonanza

142
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,151
Alejandro Velasco group in Caracas

143
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
He's a professor at NYU now

144
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,015
And he says all that oil money started to dominate the

145
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
Wheel was

146
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
By far the biggest X

147
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,903
Sport it paid most of the government's bills

148
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,487
And in the meantime everything else in the economy wilted

149
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
No one wanted to build a factory

150
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,327
No one wanted to grow food

151
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
Because the oil business was lucrative enough

152
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,191
Yeah when the country needed something it just bought it from

153
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
From someplace else

154
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
Why make it yourself when you can just

155
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,103
Buy the import with very cheap doll at Waimea Auto Parts

156
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
When you can buy auto parts

157
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Why

158
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,735
Make sure milk

159
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Anything

160
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,415
Anything absolutely ready made and I have to worry about having to go through all the procedures and you know

161
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
Investment domestically have to do they just

162
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Buy from abroad

163
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
Friendship makes you huge the depending on him

164
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
City of a country that is living and breathing oilman

165
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
They would sell the oil

166
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Which is priced in US dollars

167
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
10 converted

168
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,751
To be Venezuelan currency

169
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
Boulevard

170
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,591
And then every symptom of it is spent

171
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
The country running

172
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
Defeating clothing

173
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
And then all of a sudden

174
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
There's a problem

175
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:49,599
In 2003 the Oil Workers go on strike there is no oil there is no money

176
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
Minnesota desperately needed cash

177
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:56,767
Desperately need $2 to do everything anything that we've been talked about by imported it required right

178
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
Chavez freaks out

179
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
He has bills to pay

180
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
He's worried about his own currency

181
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
The Bolivar losing value

182
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
And so they keep the whole

183
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Economy stable

184
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
He decides to

185
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Fix

186
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Exchange rate

187
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
Between the Boulevard and the dollar

188
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,687
Travis essentially said the value of our money is what I say

189
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
It is and if you want dollars

190
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
You have to come

191
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
To the government you have to come to me

192
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Toomics

193
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,391
Financial sense it actually makes economic sense

194
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
As an emergency measure

195
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
What happened is that this measure was

196
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
Kept and maintained

197
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,071
Throughout even to today

198
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,095
And this

199
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
This was

200
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
The economic

201
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Time bomb

202
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,495
Right even after the Oil Workers strike was settled

203
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,079
Thomas kept it so that every major transaction in the country

204
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
Still involved

205
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
The government

206
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
If you wanted dollars

207
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
You needed permission to have them

208
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,759
The government set the exchange rate the government could

209
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Approve or reject

210
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Any transaction

211
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Here's Howe.

212
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,415
Alex Rosenberg was a clothing importer in Caracas

213
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,951
He brought in underwear

214
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Jeans

215
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Dress shirts

216
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
Love casual shoes

217
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
Sweaters jackets

218
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Blazers

219
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
And with these have your name on them

220
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
I know they wouldn't

221
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
They would have a couple of brands on them

222
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
He was no Calvin Klein

223
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,639
None order to import clothing he needed to pay his

224
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
Suppliers in dollars

225
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,247
And in order to get the dollars from now to go to the government

226
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,063
Improve that he wanted to bring in something essential

227
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
So the government would give him

228
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Zealous

229
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
They printed and Tire

230
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231
Official Gazette

231
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
QuickBooks of

232
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,815
Yeah bucks code Mesa

233
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Where you would check

234
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,703
Whether or not a particular material or a particular article of clothing

235
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
Had been centrally authorized

236
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
By the government

237
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
What is it alphabetical you go down you find underwear that you would you would find men's underwear made

238
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
8 out of polio

239
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Lester cotton

240
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Other fabric

241
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
And then

242
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,647
You would check in the book if the government deem this important enough

243
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Tobias

244
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Basically

245
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,351
I just believed you when you said oh there's a shipment of underwear out there no no you had to show them

246
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
Proof

247
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
That the underwear existed

248
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,495
Here's a picture of the underwear here's a picture of the brand here's what they're going to look like

249
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,799
Here's what they're made of and here's what they cost

250
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
And then you say I need

251
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
$10,000

252
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
And you say I need

253
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
X amount of

254
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,015
Yellow pieces of underwear a tax dollars

255
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
Totaling eczema

256
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Exit node Noel

257
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,951
This is all for permission to spend his own money

258
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
Pain for the underwear

259
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,583
OSB Rock receives just to see if he could exchange his

260
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
Local Boulevard

261
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
$4

262
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,703
In this might seem insane

263
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
This might seem very insane

264
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,055
But as long as the price of oil with high

265
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
There weren't actually a lot of

266
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
Serious problem

267
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
The government would eventually give you

268
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
View your dollars

269
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,247
And your underwear came into the country and all was

270
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,807
Then two things happen

271
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Number one

272
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
Hugo Chavez.

273
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:07,743
Mothers weeping children weeping adult men weeping

274
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,071
And the unluckiest man in the world takes his place

275
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
His name is Nicolas Maduro

276
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,703
He had been the foreign minister for Chavez for 8 years

277
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,799
And after all the drama and the excitement and the love of chavezz

278
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:27,199
Maduro was like it's it's like comparing a log of wood to the

279
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
To the circus that rolls into town

280
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,087
And then pour president log of wood

281
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
Gets hit with an axe

282
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
In 2014

283
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
The oil price

284
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Oil price

285
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
Light switch be depended on

286
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Drops like

287
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
The price drops in half

288
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Over 6 MI

289
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,911
And this causes Panic within the Venezuelan government

290
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
Everything they have

291
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
Everything they do

292
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
Depends on oil money

293
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
And now they have half as much oil money

294
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,895
Took the new president Maduro goes to OPEC and he

295
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
KeyBank

296
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
We have to do some

297
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
We have to do something to keep oil prices up

298
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Please help us

299
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
Countries like Norway in Saudi Arabia

300
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Conceiving

301
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Royal money

302
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Nothing suelo

303
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:13,023
Not only are we not ready for this but there's nothing that we can do to stem the decline

304
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:18,655
What is the end of any kind of Boomers there's nothing that we can do now that isn't going to hurt

305
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
A tremendous amount

306
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
So what are they do

307
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
They did not

308
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
And every trap

309
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,823
Set by Hugo Chavez

310
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
Gets sprung at the same time

311
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:32,223
The first thing that happens is that the Venezuelan government all of a sudden has

312
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
Fewer US dollars

313
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
That spigot is turned off

314
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
So the government starts being stingy with them

315
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,695
There's a huge shortage of dollars

316
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
The price goes up

317
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
People were now willing to pay hundreds

318
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
The boulevard

319
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,375
For a single US dollar naira Black Market

320
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,983
Everywhere dealing in US Dollars yeah but the government insist on selling dollars

321
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,567
If the old rate which was around 6 Bolivars for a dollar

322
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:02,943
They don't want the price for basic things like food to go up there desperate to keep things

323
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:10,111
We know what happens when there are different prices in different markets the Venezuelan people aren't stupid they looked at this

324
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,719
At least I can buy a dollar for cheap from Venezuela government

325
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
And then sell it

326
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
On the black market

327
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
And make a fortune

328
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
Of course they started

329
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
And all Heather says

330
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
There was this amazing

331
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
Risperdal

332
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
Spouse

333
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
The scratch

334
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Scratch

335
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
Scratch

336
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
People would buy an airplane ticket

337
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
To New York

338
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
They would tell the government o

339
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,503
We really need dollars for our essential trip to New York

340
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
Put anyone travel

341
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:44,159
As you had the mystery of the airplanes that had all their seats sold but no one was riding on

342
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:50,815
But there's so much profit to be made you could just buy a plane ticket and not get on absolutely because you can make so much more

343
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
More from the black market rate of dollars

344
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Now

345
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,679
Normally when this sort of thing starts

346
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,239
The country will eventually

347
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Give up they will admit

348
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
Did their currency

349
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
Is screwed up

350
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
It's worthless

351
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Are scamming them

352
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
And eventually don't let the exchange rates go back to

353
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,271
I'm not saying it's easy it is super painful.

354
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
To do with Venezuela

355
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Had except

356
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
True

357
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
Exchange rate

358
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Everything would have got more

359
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,023
Poor people that Chavez had cared so much about would not be able to afford milk

360
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
And Brad

361
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,863
The country would have to rebuild its industry

362
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
Rebuild its agriculture

363
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,447
10 things would have gotten better

364
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
But Venezuela decides to

365
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
To do exactly the off

366
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
Did any doubles down on its mistakes

367
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:41,247
Stephen did something which sounds so confusing they created different exchange rates for different people and different

368
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
Yeah and that it was confusing

369
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
They were more ways to scam

370
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
The government more ways to make money off these

371
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Exchange rate

372
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
So the government thinks okay will print more money

373
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
Absolutely wrong

374
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Inflation story

375
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:59,167
Okay so we'll stop reporting our inflation numbers or square numbers in fact

376
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,567
We will hide how badly the economy is doing but of course people figure it out they can see the prices for items in the store

377
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Doors and the prices are going crazy

378
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,943
Okay so prices are going crazy we will mandate price control

379
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,479
What state you can only make

380
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
So much profit

381
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
This is even

382
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,623
Because businesses find that the losing money every month

383
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Why

384
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
Keep selling products

385
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
You can't make any money

386
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:28,351
And even if you do make a little bit of money out of your business that money is increasingly worthless

387
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Because of

388
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
The inflation

389
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
This is really bad for Venezuela

390
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
It is

391
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
Incredibly

392
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
Play bad and it becomes

393
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
Impossible to import

394
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
Anything I mean that's what happened to Ali

395
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:44,991
Clothing guy with the underwear right but his last big shipment was for something essential who's from medical supplies

396
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,807
We wanted to import a shipment of

397
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
Non woven fabric

398
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,903
Which is basically a blue fabric that's used for

399
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
Surgical

400
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:58,559
Also the stuff you see in the hospital if you wanted to bring in both of this so you can make

401
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Yesterday

402
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Yeah

403
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Literally

404
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
The stuff

405
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
Did the neurosurgeon would have

406
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Needed for search

407
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
To save people's lives

408
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,775
And Alex go to the government for approval

409
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
Spend dollars on it

410
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
And everyday

411
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
He waits for that approve

412
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,687
You go to your computer every morning once you get to the office

413
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,783
You open that system and you're like okay let's see if I hit the lottery today

414
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
And they've authorized my

415
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
And you're hitting refresh and just seeing like

416
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,439
No no no no no or no change in status

417
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
How long can you store

418
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
We're still waiting

419
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,583
To have those goods cleared and we still

420
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
Oh that money for suppliers

421
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
In NH

422
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
So Alex

423
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Does

424
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
What he never wanted to do

425
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
He freezes

426
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
His business he steps

427
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Away from her

428
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
And stop importing any

429
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,919
And this happens over and over and over again

430
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:51,039
With all of the things that Venezuela is important which is basically everything

431
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,367
Clothing and medicine and electronics and food

432
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,439
No one can get any dollars to bring anything into

433
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,487
And this is how Christ is

434
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
It's built out of

435
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Simple

436
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Economic growth

437
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
Without a real currency their massive

438
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
Shortages there

439
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
These dangerous Hospital

440
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,471
The government is cutting school days and office hours

441
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
Just to save electricity

442
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
And all of this

443
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
In a country that is still

444
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,431
Exporting oil it is still bringing in billions of dollars

445
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
And it is not enough to save

446
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,551
And no one seems to know what should happen next

447
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,367
This is a country in the middle of a political stalemate

448
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,951
Because no politician wants to do the DraStic things

449
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,487
Cindy would be drastic

450
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
That are going to be next

451
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Passeri to fix

452
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,863
NYU Professor Alejandro says that everyone still just

453
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
Praying with the oil prices

454
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
Will go back up

455
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
More dollars we'll just

456
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
Solve everything

457
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,335
It's not like we don't know this story I'm in historian of Venezuela

458
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
I wrote about this

459
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
Premier Auto book about it

460
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Right

461
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
And so

462
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
But we we

463
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Just

464
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,551
Greeley cravos Good Times

465
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,671
And it seems like every time the bad times, we just say

466
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
Well at least sometime in the future

467
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
I have another good

468
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,791
Instead of fixing the problem

469
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
Which is at the whole economy is based on something volatile

470
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,935
And if you try to maintain control no matter what

471
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
You're going to lose it

472
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,863
