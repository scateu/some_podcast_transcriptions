1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,352
Quick warning there are a lot of bad words in the show some offensive language

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,192
We have been getting flooded

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,216
Baidu

4
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,240
Bizarro

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,264
Phone calls

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,568
There scam phone calls but that's not the weird part

7
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,848
The weird part

8
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
Is the day app

9
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,176
Pure to be coming from a phone number

10
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,480
It is almost exactly the same

11
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,760
As our phone

12
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,552
So say my number is

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,344
646

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,368
898

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
1 2 3 4

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,696
Then I'm getting a call from

17
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,464
6 / 6

18
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,792
Same area code 898 same next three numbers

19
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,352
7777 difference

20
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
Last for

21
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,448
And I think I know this is probably my Pharmacy maybe this

22
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,216
This is my neighbor down the

23
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,776
The street and so I pick up but no

24
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,568
It is almost always

25
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
Aruba

26
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,640
Well you have been selected

27
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,432
A week's vacation

28
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:56,832
Orlando Florida right next to Disney what is going on I talked about robot before and we wanted to know

29
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,112
Know how common

30
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,904
So we put out a call to

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
You Planet Money listeners

32
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,744
We asked hey are you getting these phone calls

33
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,536
Oh my God she asked

34
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,584
Usually comes about once a week

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,888
Probably three or four a day

36
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424
Four different phone calls

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
And that 8 minutes fan on

38
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Tuesday morning

39
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,776
We got around a thousand

40
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
Responses from everywhere from

41
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,616
St Louis to Southern California

42
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Canada

43
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,968
And I just got one about 10 minutes before you called as a matter of fact

44
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
Hi this is Elizabeth from Resorts Bubba Bubba blah

45
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,184
And I picked the phone up and looked at the caller ID

46
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,976
And I guess I got to

47
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,304
Puzzled look on my face cuz my husband said who's calling

48
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,864
As I said apparently we are

49
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,936
Because the number in the redoubt 1 hour phone number

50
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
The calls are coming

51
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,008
From inside the house

52
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Kenny Malone and I'm finally home today on the show

53
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,368
Why are we suddenly inundated with the spam calls from our own phone number from our neighbor's phone

54
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672
Phone numbers we learn how the scam works

55
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,024

We have learned that this phenomenon this thing where you

63
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,000
You get a phone call

64
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
And it's from a number that works

65
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
Exactly what your number

66
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
This is called Neighbor

67
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
Stupid

68
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Neighbor

69
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
Because

70
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Number

71
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
Neighborhood

72
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,032
Spoofing that isn't someone making a call to

73
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
Guys has their number with

74
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
A different number

75
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
What we're going to do today

76
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
Is dig into Neighbors

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Spoofing by looking at

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,248
Three main questions

79
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
Question 1

80
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
Why is this happening so much

81
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Right now

82
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Question 2

83
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
What happens when you decide to

84
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
Answer

85
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
One of these calls

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,280
This part is why we put a language warning at the top of

87
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
A little crazy

88
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
And question 3 is

89
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
Candy skulls

90
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
Puppy stopped okay

91
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
Question 1

92
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,984
Why is this such a big

93
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
Sing all of

94
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
To help us answer this we called up

95
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
Jonathan Nelson

96
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,944
He's with a tech company called hiya and one of the things he does is help

97
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
Block robocalls

98
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,296
The confusion that that a lot of folks

99
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Have

100
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,928
When receiving a phone calls you you would assume that the phone number that's shown to you

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,512
Is is the exact number that actually making the call

102
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Yeah

103
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,328
Yes we don't understand how that's not

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
The case

105
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Johnson says

106
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,424
There didn't used to be a spoof

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Problem

108
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,008
If you got call you knew who it was from

109
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
Whether the person was calling from a landline or cell phone the number you saw on your caller ID was the number they were calling

110
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
But now

111
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,992
You can place a call using something called

112
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
Voice over IP

113
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,856
IP as an Internet Protocol basically you

114
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
You can use a computer to make a call

115
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,768
It's over the internet but it shows up on somebody else's phone as if it is just a regular old phone

116
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:21,375
And voice over IP has made it possible to make it look like

117
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
You're calling from a different number

118
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
That is what we call call spoofing

119
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,775
They're totally legitimate reasons to spoof

120
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,103
Number so for example maybe you are Ted launcer

121
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Service

122
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
And you have

123
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
A few phone lines but really you want

124
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,271
All of your outgoing calls to have the same number so you look like this

125
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Unified compass

126
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,575
Great keep things simple

127
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
But of course

128
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,159
Scammers have discovered that they can also

129
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
That's if they spoof numbers

130
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,535
They can make it to the people are more likely to pick up their calls

131
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,863
So there was one scam for example where they would make it look like

132
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,983
IRS was calling you there was another one where they would make it look like you were trying

133
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:03,103
To call yourself I actually got one of those a couple weeks ago I had a missed call from myself

134
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:09,503
Why would anyone answer a call from yourself I don't think that would work very well I'm surprised they actually are stilts

135
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
Trying it and eventually

136
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Someone

137
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Somewhere

138
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Hadn't

139
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,391
Evil spoofing Eureka moment

140
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
And they said okay

141
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,719
So maybe not the exact same number that

142
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,047
We're calling but what if we just use the same first six digits

143
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,863
And then randomly select 4 more digits

144
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:30,751
It will look like the neighbor is calling in February 2017 Jonathan says the started taking off

145
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
Someone had to try this

146
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:37,919
First that had to been the one scammer who had this idea and I just picture them bragging online to their

147
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,479
Hacker friends but hey check this out

148
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,087
Is amazing and then everyone started to me and so the answer to our first question

149
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
Why is this happening all of a sudden

150
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
It's because the internet makes it

151
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
Possible and actually

152
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,279
Easier everyday and also the scammers have discovered

153
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,607
That it works if they make it look like our neighbors are calling us

154
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
We're more likely

155
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
To pick up the phone

156
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,335
So just out of curiosity we wanted to see how easy it is to neighbor spoof

157
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
If somebody it is

158
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
Super

159
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,711
There are all kinds of software online

160
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
Type in the number you want to call

161
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,343
Type in the number you want to look like you're calling from and boom

162
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
We tried it out on Noel King

163
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
Sound like a robot

164
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
Noel

165
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
You have won a free vacation

166
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
I have not won a free vacation

167
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:39,871
I know you have won a free vacation

168
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:46,271
All right

169
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
Question number two

170
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
What exactly is happening when we

171
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
Do answer our phone

172
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,951
So we had an outstanding request for a collie to your planet

173
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,767
If you happen to get one of these neighbors spoof

174
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
Open calls

175
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,583
You please just go and grab a recorder

176
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,447
And see if you can record a call and talk to them and find out what they want where they are like whatever you can

177
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Figure out

178
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,263
And it did not take long

179
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,359
Until our news reporter Julia DeWitt got one of these phone calls

180
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,687
And we have Julia in the studio with us now hello Julia

181
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Hey guys

182
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,831
And we're actually just going to hand it off to Julian out to tell us about his phone call and what she figured out

183
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,415
Cities called came from a spoofed number it looks like my number from boss

184
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,279
And it started with a robot to see if you qualify

185
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,375
Press 2 to be taken off the list so I pressed one

186
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423

00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095

Stomach does not

313
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
Okay so the Federal Communications Commission the SEC

314
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
They oversee telecommunicate

315
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
You know

316
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
Phone calls

317
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,415
And also you got a chance to talk to the chairman Ajit Pai about call spoofing and neighbors 2

318
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,999
Yeah because robocalls telemarketing calls

319
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,351
Spoofed calls that whole sort of Monsters Universe of unwanted

320
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
She called

321
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
This is

322
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,703
Is number one consumer

323
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471

German

325
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
Have you been spoofed

326
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,943
Oh absolutely so every now and then. Even on my work Blackberry I'll see a call that seems to be coming

327
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
Cell phone oh yeah the old seem to be coming from

328
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
Be the 202 area code

329
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,623
Which is here in Washington and then are prefix for these that blackberries

330
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
And I know for a fact

331
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,975
That's that you know it's probably not someone from the office

332
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,559
Sometimes I answered just for the heck of it end

333
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:31,167
Won't hold I've wanted vacation to from Marriott and I'm assuming he told you that

334
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:37,567
He's got it all under control it's going to be completely fixed in the next six weeks tell me that that's true that the calls are end

335
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,407
It's not so true I mean they're trying a few different things

336
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
The easiest thing that they're trying so far he

337
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:48,063
She said is there letting phone carriers block certain calls that are known to be

338
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
Spoofed calls are robo

339
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,159
Before the action that we took earlier this

340
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:57,791
Spring under the SEC rule carriers were obligated to patch through any calls that they got

341
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
It was Ian so

342
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,679
That's one of things we did was to allow them to take action against those spoofed numbers

343
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,983
But if you eat pie was telling me that

344
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,079
What they really have in mind is something far more time

345
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,151
Complicated but far better as a

346
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,479
Which is the ultimate solution I think to this problem

347
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:22,879
Switches to best find a call authentication standard basically we would be able to

348
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Kodak unique

349
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
Signature

350
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,255
In every phone number that's really being used

351
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:34,911
Answer when a call is placed using that phone number the recipient of that call can have every confidence and knowing that okay this is the

352
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
The digital fingerprint for that number

353
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,775
I can trust that this is not a scam artist or somebody else

354
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,591
Who's impersonating the owner of that number

355
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,895
Oh how many years would it take to get

356
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:51,295
An authentication system like that in place

357
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,903
Yesterday. But this is exceptionally complexo what's like a time frame are we talking

358
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02,303
A year from now a decade from you I have no idea because we can't predict exactly how the internet
