1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:03,840
Let's talk about cold beer in Indiana I understand that's been a big part of your life

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,656
Yeah it has been

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:11,776
This is Jay Ricker runs a chain of convenience stores in Indiana called Ricker's logic

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,104
And if it sounds kind of weary here there's a reason

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,896
He spent the last few months

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:21,760
Deep in the fine print of Indiana state law governing the sale of

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,528
Beer and wine

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:23,808
You can sell

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576
Warmed

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368
Home

11
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,392
Cold wine

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,440
But we can't sell

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
Colby

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,744
A lot of States have

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,048
Strange rules surrounding the sale of

16
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,352
In New York for example

17
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,936
You can only buy wine at these little kind of neighborhood wine stores

18
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240
In New Hampshire if you can only buy liquor at

19
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,520
State-run stores

20
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,824
And in Indiana there was a rule

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,896
But you can sell cold beer in liquor stores and in restaurant

22
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,688
But not

23
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,480
Any thought well

24
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
Restaurants

25
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,272
Can sell cold beer

26
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,832
I got these little restaurants inside my stores

27
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,368
He dug into the fine print

28
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:03,488
And he with the help of his lawyers worked out a very precise way for his stores to sell

29
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:08,096
So you walk up to the counter and you say I'd like to get a six pack of beer

30
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,632
And so we cards

31
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
Let me ring you up

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,568
Then we get it out of a cooler that's behind a counter that you can't go to the can't be self serve that's a big No-No okay

33
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,128
Can we pull it out of there we put it in a sack

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,456
Walk around the counter we can't sit on the counter in

35
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,504
What you take it off the counter

36
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
Running a bar okay and then you walk

37
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,088
Shut the door after we handed to

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
It's that

39
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
Easy

40
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
Ricker's

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
Started selling cold beer just

42
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
A few weeks ago

43
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:38,304
And the Indiana liquor stores the other places allowed to sell cold beer

44
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Didn't like it

45
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,120
They said Ricker's was quote

46
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,680
Thumbing their noses at the Indiana

47
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,544
So I went to one of those legislators should I said hey here's what we're doing

48
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,592
You know and we have followed the law

49
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
And

50
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
He

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
He admitted yes you have

52
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,224
But that's not the intent of the law

53
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
And we're going to change it

54
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,368
Just this week Indiana Senate Bill 538 passed out of committee

55
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,952
If it becomes a lot records will no longer be able to sell coal

56
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,560
This new law may also inadvertently band other places

57
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
From selling cold beer

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Bowling alley

59
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
Golf Course

60
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,704
Which of course this is what always happens with find

61
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
Unintended consequence

62
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,288
And the solution to those consequences

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
More fine print

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,712
Printer prints hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob Goldstein

65
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,760
Today in the show the fine print

66
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,088
Three stories about what happens when you actually read

67
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:38,208
There's a nice Midwestern family with a tan Minivan and a Nationwide Bank scheme

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
I think battle over the essence of the Snuggie

69
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,096
But first a fight over fine print

70
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
And printers

71
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
That just made it to the Supreme Court

72
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:56,128
We'd like to say a quick thank you and share a message from one of our sponsors State Farm State Farm as much

73
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,408
More than just an insurance

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,016
They're also committed to making a positive impact in the communities they serve

75
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,064
One way is through neighborhood of

76
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,696

00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,656
Act of doing

80
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
State Farm

81
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
Here to help life

82
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,752
Go right

83
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:30,176
Finkelstein should we start with the property we start with the property at Jacobs

84
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
Printer cartridge

85
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,528
Switch this is the toner cartridge that goes inside your standard

86
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
And there is fine print

87
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,392
On the outside of his toner cartridge box

88
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
And what the fine print basically says it

89
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,512
If you open this box you are entering into

90
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Contract

91
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,328
And you're giving up some of your rights

92
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,192
The Supreme Court is now trying to settle an argument over this

93
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Fine print

94
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,520
Depending on how this case is resolved

95
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
It is not just going to affect

96
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
The price of your printer cartridge

97
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
It actually could have

98
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,968
Huge impact on a lot of things that we buy

99
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
Like Alexa

100
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,552
Tronix like cars like medicines

101
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
All because of the fine print

102
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
I'm a sprinter car

103
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
I meant can I tell you what

104
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
Please

105
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Okay

106
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
This cartridge

107
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
Is made by a company called Lex

108
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,119
Accident right here on the box and lexmark's business model is

109
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Standard printer busy

110
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
The printer itself is pretty cheap

111
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,287
But then when you need to buy a new ink cartridge

112
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
That is where they get you

113
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
This cartridge

114
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,895
Cost $130

115
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
Think yes

116
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,527
And people don't want to pay $130 every time they buy a car

117
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
4 Inc

118
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Yes

119
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,391
So there are these smaller third-party companies that

120
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
Find and buy empty printer cartridge

121
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
Refill them with their own it I love it so much

122
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
FML sell it to you for like

123
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
Half the price

124
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
Instead of $130

125
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,679
Still sell you a refilled cartridge used cartridge

126
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
For $65

127
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
Fantastic right

128
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
For these small companies

129
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
Fantastic Four you and me

130
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
Fantastic Four everybody except

131
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,943
Lexmark company that is selling cheap printers so that they can sell

132
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
Expensive ink

133
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,015
That's exactly basically destroys our business

134
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:15,135
So there's this little company that's in the business of refilling toner cartridges

135
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
25 people in West

136
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Virginia

137
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
And Lexmark is suing that

138
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
Suing them

139
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
What what is there are

140
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
The answer lies in

141
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
The fine print

142
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
On this phone

143
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,495
Okay picking up the boxes

144
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,079
It's heavy and I'm not going to open it

145
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,919
For reasons which out the vault in just a second

146
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
Beside of this

147
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,831
Toner Baca from Lexmark it says the following

148
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
Opening this package

149
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:52,767
Or using the patented cartridge inside confirms your acceptance of the following license

150
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,815
Okay so I'm just going to stop you there so they're saying

151
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,351
If you open this box

152
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
You're agreeing to this.

153
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
That's right

154
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,519
The patented toner cartridge is sold at a special price

155
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
Subject to a patent restriction

156
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
That it may be used

157
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Only

158
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
Once

159
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
One time

160
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,039
Use it but you cannot sell it or give it to that little company

161
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
That that takes our cartridges

162
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,367
Isn't that is not allowed

163
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,927
You're making a deal when you open this box and that deal Pro

164
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
Hibbetts you from doing that

165
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
That is lexmark's argue

166
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,583
Now here is the other side

167
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
Juicy argument being made by the small

168
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
There is a legal term called

169
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
Patent exhaust

170
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Patent exhaust

171
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,591
Yes what it means if you Jacob Goldstein go into a store and buy some

172
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,383
Even if it's patent

173
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
Once you have bought it

174
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
It now belongs to you

175
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
The company that holds the patent

176
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,087
Can't tell you what to do with it

177
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,159
Their rights are exhausted patent rights on the product

178
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Exhausted one side

179
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
Yes and you can do whatever you

180
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
Okay so that's why I can

181
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,607
Say by a computer and then turn around and sell it to somebody else

182
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
Because once I buy it I own it

183
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
I can do what I want

184
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,495
Bingos but there's a legal exception to patent

185
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
Exhaustion which says

186
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,591
You can do what Lexmark is doing

187
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
You can say no no no

188
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
Don't refill my stuff

189
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
Don't reuse my stuff

190
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,551
As long as you put it on the product itself as long as you write it

191
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
In fine print on this item

192
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
You can't resell this

193
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
You can't

194
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Resell this

195
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
And that's what this big argument is

196
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,071
So when you put it that way it seems like oh okay the laws in lexmark's favor

197
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,375
But you know the Supreme Court doesn't take that many

198
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
And so the fact that they took it tells me a

199
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
It must be more complicated than it sounds

200
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
NB

201
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,823
There must be some larger thing at stake

202
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
Right cuz that's what

203
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
Steaks here for a lot of companies and for a lot of Prada

204
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,831
And you can see that in the fact that many many many big companies like

205
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,879
Costco and LG Electronics

206
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
Have filed an amicus brief

207
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,255
On behalf of the little company in West Virginia doing the refill

208
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
Because all of those big companies

209
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
They sell you stuff

210
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
With patented Parts all the

211
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
What time

212
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:11,519
These companies want a world where they can sell you something and you're free and clear you can do what you want with

213
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
There is

214
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
One last

215
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Twisty

216
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,687
Okay there's this other brief floating around

217
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
On behalf

218
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Flexsmart

219
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
It's signed by a bunch of

220
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,831
Business professors economics professors Lapras

221
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
And what they say and what Lexmark says is

222
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
Lexmark actually offers

223
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,767
Two different versions of this toner card

224
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
This one with the fine print on it

225
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,119
There is also another version

226
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,911
That is more expensive

227
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,007
But you can do whatever you want no fine print

228
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
So the concern is

229
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
If Lexmark loses this

230
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:52,223
Case it will no longer be in its interest to bother making the cheaper version

231
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,527
And you and me and everybody else

232
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
Could end up paying

233
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
Even higher prices

234
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Is mapreduce new

235
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
If we're buying them from lexmod

236
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,487
But maybe it'll get easier to get the cheap

237
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
Prefilled cartridge

238
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,071
But then if we're all buying cheap refilled cartridge

239
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,119
Just maybe they won't tell the printer

240
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
For cheap anymore in the first

241
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
So the printer

242
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,543
Maniscalco

243
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
Sol yourwelcome next up a road trip

244
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,343
What's the first can you tell me the fur

245
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Entry of the first

246
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Journal

247
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
Alright so we

248
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,767
August 9th 1998 we Departed

249
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
822

250
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
Central Standard Time

251
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
This is a me mileage

252
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
10000 518 on the

253
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
She's an accountant

254
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
Her husband is also on a cow

255
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,895
Canton Ohio it 228 and gas was $0.81 and they took their two young kids

256
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
Kids on a rope

257
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,527
We got the Youngstown around 6:30 the hotel Comfort Inn was no great establishment

258
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,343
They too early for everyone

259
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,231
I first bank was in Greenville Pennsylvania about 45 minutes away we found it with no trouble and the people were very efficient

260
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
We were on our way in 20 minutes

261
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
It was the second day of their big Road

262
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
And Amy and her husband Dave

263
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
I just opened

264
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
Savings account

265
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
Our next stop was in

266
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Hollidaysburg

267
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,983
What a cute downtown

268
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,311
We headed from here to Mount Olive and other blinding rain

269
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,127
It was a Mad Dash from there to Milton these are all banks.

270
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
They're like reverse

271
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Bankruptcy

272
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,503
Going from bank to bank to bank and putting money into each one

273
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
Opening one savings account after another

274
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,855
We got the mail in time but couldn't find the base

275
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Oh yeah that way

276
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:40,255
Until it had been closed for 5 minutes we left info in the night depository we'll see what happens

277
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
A mandate for opening all these banking

278
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
Because they wanted to make money off the fine

279
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
Two years before the road trip

280
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,263
David started opening Accounts at little Banks all around where they live

281
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,823
These Banks were a particular kind of bad

282
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
Called Mutual

283
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,687
Mutual banks are owned by people with Accounts at the

284
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
You can think of it like a like a co-op

285
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
Back at this time

286
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Time back in the night

287
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
A lot of these Banks were converting

288
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,415
From being Mutual Banks to being just like regular Bank

289
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
Banks with stock that trades on the stock market

290
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
And here's the fine print part

291
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
Under Federal regular

292
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,375
People who had Accounts at the Mutual Bank

293
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Got first crack

294
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Get the stock

295
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
In the stock almost always went up

296
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
So Dave goes around us

297
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Town opens Aldi's

298
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,823
And sure enough a little while later

299
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
You got a letter from one of the back

300
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,175
It was converting to become a regular

301
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,479
If you could be first in line to buy the stuff

302
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
So I sent money in

303
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,671
What's a lot of money sent it in got the shares and the shares went up this is pretty cool

304
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
Yeah and I said well

305
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
There must be more mutual's in a country

306
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,607
I scouted around and found a company that was selling a list

307
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
And so I bought the list

308
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:55,775
We got some maps from AAA cover them with little yellow Post-it notes on all the banks are going to hit and then

309
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
Banking Road

310
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,847
We were always

311
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,407
No honest work we don't live

312
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
Here we live in the Midwest

313
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,807
But you felt like when you walked out with that password when you walked out with that pass book

314
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
Weed one

315
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:13,183
They drove North from Pennsylvania into New England opening bank accounts along the way

316
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
Also better vacation

317
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
They went whale watching watch

318
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
Fenway Park

319
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
24 hikes in the mountains

320
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
By the time they got home they driven more than

321
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
2000 miles

322
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
An open account

323
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
A23

324
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
3 bags

325
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
And then

326
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
The weight

327
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
The way this thing works

328
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:32,127
You don't know when or even if any particular Mutual Bank is going to convert

329
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
Going to have an IPO

330
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:39,039
Some of the banks were Amy and Dave opened accounts on that trip almost 20 years ago are still plugging away asthma

331
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
But others did have IPOs

332
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Esl stock

333
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
Steven Amy bought shares and they almost never lost

334
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,279
It's rare I think I probably lost money on three out of 60 that I've done

335
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,071
In other words he made a profit

336
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
57 out of 6

337
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
The family went on Moore Road

338
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
Open more account

339
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
More than 300 in all

340
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,335
Dave and Amy didn't want to talk about exactly how much money they made

341
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
In fact they asked me not to use their last name

342
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,711
They said they haven't told many people about their Bank thing

343
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
They still live in the same house they've always lived

344
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
Still driving old van

345
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
But clearly this has been good

346
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
District

347
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,671
This way they figured out to process

348
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
Set from the fine print

349
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
It seems to be winding down

350
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,535
Nobody starting new Mutual Bank

351
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
There aren't that many

352
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143
Still Amy and Dave's daughter Sarah

353
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
Who is now also an accountant

354
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
Told me there may still be a little action

355
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,079
Last December I had a little time off and I made

356
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
EuroTrip

357
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
By myself to Boston

358
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:42,271
And looped around Massachusetts Connecticut New Jersey New York there aren't many left data

359
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,855
Waiting to take you to do it to to open accounts

360
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:52,255
I visited some friends along the way

361
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
Sorry figure

362
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,679
Sarah opened 11 accounts in all

363
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,263
She hasn't made any money off of them yet

364
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,871
In a minute the story about the meaning of a snuggie

365
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:13,759
Support for Planet Money and the following message come from ishares

366
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,575

00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,207
Ishares by BlackRock inspired to build

Katie Malone

Hater

371
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
I'm good

372
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
I've been in the weeds

373
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
On something that maybe

374
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
How about 3 tonight with the Snuggie

375
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
Sure how much TV

376
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,127
Like a blanket with holes in it

377
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:45,247
Yeah the idea idea is that a normal blanket slips off and it's very hard to stick your arms through normal blanket

378
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,575
The grab the remote in there for a blanket with sleeves as the solution

379
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,391
So here we are with a dispute about what the snug

380
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
It's

381
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Is it apus

382
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
The blanket

383
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Port is it like

384
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
A piece of clothing

385
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
Like a robe

386
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Yeah and this is this is

387
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,655
An important distinction their millions of dollars on the line

388
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
+ 2

389
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,287
Get to the bottom of this I visited a lawyer named Joe sprayer again who somebody told me

390
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
Had an office

391
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
Spoonful of Snuggies

392
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
But by the time I got to his office and

393
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
The time I met him he walk me inside

394
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
The last I'm down to one

395
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
What

396
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
Breaking open

397
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
C1

398
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Lovely

399
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Brown snake

400
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
SoJO represents the

401
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
Company that sell Snuggie

402
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Udall Star Market

403
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,143
I'm going to wear this for us the interview if that's all right with you I prefer the term use it

404
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
Rather than lyrics

405
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
Oh I see what you're doing

406
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
What is he

407
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
Okay here's what's going on

408
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
There's a fight

409
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
Over where the Snuggie Falls

410
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,639
It's something called the harmonized Tariff

411
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
I love to harmonize

412
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
It's like the finest

413
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Fine print

414
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,319
If it's this giant book where they try and classify

415
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,647
Every single object that you could theoretically ever imp

416
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,231
There's life foxes 4.8% tariff in there

417
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
Import Ally Fox

418
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Walking sticks

419
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
4.0 /

420
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,375
Pictures of the top of your head your like coffee

421
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,423
0% tariff I got this thing down

422
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
SoJO at a company that

423
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Dead cells the Snuggie

424
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:16,383
They they claim that the Snuggie would fall under Section 6301 point

425
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,943
40.00

426
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,015
Blankets and traveling rugs from synthetic fiber

427
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Tara

428
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
8.5 /

429
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,367
Snuggie wants it to be a blanket

430
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
And obviously you don't

431
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
Wearable

432
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,255
Which is why this lawyer is playing this game if he wants to say used

433
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
That's exactly right

434
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,607
But

435
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
And therefore it should

436
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,983
To fall under Section 6 114.3 0.30

437
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
Other garments

438
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,079
Knitted or crocheted of man-made fiber it set

439
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
So they think it's a garment it something you wear

440
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
Fall in the same category as Maybe

441
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,527
Graduation gown or like a Priestly cloak or whatever

442
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,367
And I'm going to guess what if it's a garment it's taxed at a higher rate than if it's a blank

443
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
14.9%

444
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,719
Okay so it's like about 15% versus

445
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Is 8 1/2

446
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Speed difference

447
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,911
So sluggish at the blanket and a half percent the government says it's kind of like a robe 15%

448
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,263
What is it this battle recently went before the US court of international trade

449
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
Both parties argue their sides

450
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
And US court decided

451
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Yeah

452
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
This thing is a black

453
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
G1

454
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
Snuggie win

455
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
But the government is probably

456
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
Course somebody's always good

457
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
So this story is

458
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
Absurd

459
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
On its face

460
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,255
Which is kind of the essence of fine

461
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
Is there a silly details to a

462
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
But

463
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,935
You know we have a world where we have

464
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Different text

465
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,775
Traits for every possible thing that somebody could

466
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
Import

467
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,639
I'm so the only thing that can happen in that world is you wind up with lawyers

468
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
In court

469
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,271
Arguing over whether a blanket with holes in it is actually not a blanket but a rope

470
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
I mean find Prince

471
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
Exist for a reason

472
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
Fine print exist

473
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,975
Because the world is in fact not as simple as we want it to be

474
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
We need fine print

475
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,823
Blank

476
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,127
Special thanks to date to Sarah and Jack
