00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:04,864
Heights Jacob Goldstein Today Show first ran in 2014

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,656
There's a brief update at the end

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,704
This is somewhere in Utah

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,984
I'm not going to say where

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,544
Outside a small town the end of a dirt road

6
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,336
One of those storage for sale

7
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:18,432
You know the places where people stick stuff that they don't have room for in their basement

8
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:21,248
Were they occasionally put something really value

9
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,296
What kind of security do you have there

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,856
I have a padlock

11
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,952
The door

12
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
This is Bob Peters

13
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,328
Bob claim to sound that thing

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
People have sought

15
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
Thousands of you

16
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,168
An investment

17
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,216
Guaranteed double in value

18
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,496
Free money

19
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,288
And keeps it in the storage locker

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,944
Plug in the lights

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
So I can see

22
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,624
There's the usual stuff boxes of family photos couple bikes car seats actually an old car with a flat tire

23
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,672
And then in the middle of all this stuff

24
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,440
There it is

25
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
His secret

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
Treasure

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,024
When I tell you what it is

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
It's going to seem very Orange

29
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:11,424
Marketing College accounting or science

30
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,496
Books by thousands of fat used

31
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
Industries

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,824
American history

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
Nursing

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
The boringness of this

35
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,992
That is Bob's itch

36
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:31,392
He's figured out something about the history of the Vietnam War 4th edition in mathematics with applications that apparently

37
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,792
No one else knows living with art the art of public speaking

38
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
Taking loan welcome to Planet Money I'm David catching there's a term in economics for this kind of thing Arbitrage

39
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,592
Women's free money guaranteed way to buy low and sell high are basically impossible to find

40
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,944
Damn show two guys think they did

41
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:01,088
Support for this podcast in the following message come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

42
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:07,488
Developing solutions to support strong families and communities to help ensure a brighter future for America's

Children more information is available at aecf. Org

44
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,656
A little while ago we did a show about college text

45
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
And afterward we got an email

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
From Bob's brother-in-law

47
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
Sing

48
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
Great show

49
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,384
But by the way there is just one other little odd corner of the textbook world you might be

50
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
And of course we were

51
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:31,296
I called up Bob and he told me he discovered this textbook Thing by accident

52
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,856
He's running a small business out of his house selling

53
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
T-shirts

54
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
Flip flops and stuffed animals on

55
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
On Amazon

56
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
And sometimes telling you

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
He picked them up at a local thrift store

58
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
I'm trying to sell them online

59
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
Quickly you learned that

60
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,960
Fiction books are worthless after they come out with in 6-7 months

61
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,544
Everybody's got a copy of it and no one wants to buy another copy of it

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
Text books he noticed something weird

63
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
Their prices Jump Around

64
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
A lot

65
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,736
The first time you noticed this was with an economics text

66
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,320
He put it up on Amazon offering to sell it for 15 bucks

67
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
Someone bought it

68
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,696
But then as he was packaging the book to ship it off he looked online again

69
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,024
Any found that the going price for the book had jumped up

70
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,304
225 bus

71
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,400
Wow send this book went up in value did you wonder why that was happening

72
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:24,800
No I didn't even give it much thought that I'm just wishing that I would have sold it for more money

73
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,592
That was an extra $10 you could have

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
We started tracking a few

75
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,224
I saw this one book go from a few dollars up to 60

76
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,832
The classic example of Arbitrage is that you find one thing that is selling for

77
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Two different

78
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Say Toyota stock

79
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,720
Is trading for $100 a share on the New York Stock

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,584
Play Seether on the Japanese exchange it selling for more $102

81
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,400
You could buy it on the first exchange sell it on the 2nd

82
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,216
Done couple Mouse clicks on YouTube box

83
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Free money

84
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,080
Bob thought she was seeing something similar in textbook prices

85
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
Only the prices were mismatched over

86
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
Time

87
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
Given that a fury for what's going on

88
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
He guessed that the prices were going up and down

89
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
With the College calendar

90
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
When a semester ended say it's summer

91
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
That's when the books should be cheap

92
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
Students will be eager to unload their heavy book

93
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,024
And there be no one particularly site to buy them

94
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,351
No one is looking for a nice textbook in July to curl up with on the

95
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Beach

96
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,167
When the next school year start in

97
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
Classes

98
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495
Aaron would be like I need a book I need a book

99
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
And prices should go up

100
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,359
If I was right and this was really happening

101
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Reliably

102
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
With lots of books

103
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
She could make money

104
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
Buy Low sell High

105
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,527
Last year he tried it out with one book and protect

106
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
Campbell's biology

107
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
Huge thousand paged

108
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,671
Waiting for the price to drop anybody

109
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Eight of them

110
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
Around 8 bucks each

111
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,815
Any posted them on Amazon for $39.99

112
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
You waited

113
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
And he sold them all

114
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,447
Powershell create I'm like okay there's something here

115
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
And this is when I approached Kenny

116
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
He's my brother-in-law

117
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
Kenny Jacobson

118
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
. if I remember correctly

119
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
It was my sister

120
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,943
We were on the phone she's like

121
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
Bob has some idea that has to do with

122
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
Xbox and

123
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,879
Programming and database I don't know you want to talk to him

124
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,951
Thor coming down for Easter saying talk to him then

125
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
They got together at Kenny's parents

126
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
And Bob explain his secret

127
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
What he found

128
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
He said he wanted to scale it up

129
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
Kenny was a programmer

130
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,191
Bob figured he could write some code to watch the prices and

131
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Analyze them

132
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
Helping figure out what books to buy

133
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
When

134
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Kenny listen to the

135
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:39,455
During that time I was kind of obsessed with the stock market is reading all these books and I'm a programmer

136
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
Buy trade and sell

137
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,391
I think every programmer goes through a phase where he or she thinks they can beat the market you know because they can

138
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,511
Program their way through it and and I learned

139
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
My experience.

140
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:59,679
You can't be with the stock market there were too many people

141
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,007
Too many computer trading algorithms all looking for any little pad

142
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
That's the thing about Arbitrage

143
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,615
Everyone is looking for these ways to make free money

144
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,687
And as soon as someone finds some little mispricing

145
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
It goes away

146
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
The act of trying to get

147
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
Free money

148
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
Pushes the prices back into a line

149
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
Stock market seems unbeatable

150
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,159
But maybe there was a way to beat

151
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
The textbook

152
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
Now if you're looking at stocks or bonds or some

153
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
There's a ton of data

154
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
Neglected for decades

155
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
You can make any chart or graph

156
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
Protect books there was nothing like

157
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
They needed to figure it all out

158
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,775
Kenny Road code that will go to the Amazon website

159
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,103
And automatically check what price thousands of different textbook

160
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Trucks were selling for

161
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
It did this every night

162
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,455
What's Campbell's biology selling for now

163
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Then again the next

164
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
What's Italian for now

165
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
The next day

166
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
They let this run for months

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
Waited patient

168
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
Computer sucking up all this

169
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
And then they started to make charts

170
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
See if they could

171
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Find that semester

172
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
Once we had a Year's worth of data

173
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,095
Then you should really see the the valley

174
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
And the peak

175
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:06,751
Is it a really clear pattern not everyone has a clear proud pattern but some of them are just amazing

176
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
What one looks really amazing

177
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
Well the gold standard for this

178
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,967
This textbook season is adult development and aging

179
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
Let me find out what was it called

180
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,343
You want to buy has been number 0 0 7

181
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,135
312

182
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
E85

183
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
Force Talia

184
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,255
We've got six of those in inventory

185
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Oh my gosh

186
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
Okay that is a guitar

187
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,447
In the summer the book it's a low of $16.92

188
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
But then

189
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,287
Right around January 1st

190
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
It starts shooting up

191
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
And at

192
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,663
January 29th

193
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,735
It's in the $250 range

194
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
From 16x to 250

195
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
The chance to make over

196
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
$200 on a single

197
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
The pattern was there for lots of books

198
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
Arbitrage

199
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
Free money

200
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,279
It's as if you'd found a stock

201
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,351
That went up and down at very regular time

202
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,935
I'm so that you know exactly when you could buy it and then you would know exactly when this

203
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
And you would guaranteed make money

204
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
Yeah that's what got us excited

205
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
They decided to go all-in

206
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
My $10,000 worth

207
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
The views textbook

208
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,271
Which one you're buying books for eight bucks or four bucks each

209
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
It's a lot of books

210
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,599
You're like a hedge fund for text

211
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,927
That's a good way of looking at it yes

212
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
A very small light

213
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
A very small one

214
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,351
1 basic operating principle of hedge funds is that

215
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,399
If you discovered a secret way to make money

216
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,239
You don't email reporters about it and then explain your whole strategy

217
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
But they got a head start

218
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
A couple years data that no one else

219
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:51,711
And when they describe the day-to-day of running a textbook Arbitrage hedge fund

220
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,015
I feel a lot less like free money

221
00:08:54,527 --> 00:09:00,671
Bob sometimes gets 40 boxes in the mail yet to open each of them put the books in the car take him to the storage locker

222
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:06,559
Posting for sale on Amazon when someone buys a book and got to go back to the storage locker get the book packaged up ship it off

223
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,399
As you might imagine the folks at the post office know I'm pretty well

224
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
They let him go in through the backdoor

225
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
I don't know

226
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
I don't know if we should

227
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,055
Say that I don't want anyone to get in trouble

228
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
It's like he's another employee there

229
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
As investment funds go

230
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
This was worked out pretty well

231
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,503
For every dollar we put in we get $2 back

232
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Does that sound right Bob

233
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,391
Yeah yeah it's it's about right that's pretty conservative but probably after

234
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
He doubled your money in this semester

235
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Yeah

236
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:40,095
I looked up the top performing hedge funds and their average returns are like 25%

237
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
Meaning if you invested $1 you get

238
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
A dollar 25 back

239
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
Kenny and Bob's textbook strategy

240
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
Did much better than that

241
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
They double their money in half a year

242
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
They outperformed the best hedge

243
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
NOK

244
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,991
They're only looking at making $10,000

245
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,063
And when you factor in Bob's labor all that box opening

246
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
It looks less good

247
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
But still

248
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
In a certain light

249
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Impressive

250
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,719
Not everyone is impressed

251
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,023
In fact some people are kind of pissed off

252
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:17,471
I have learned I have to be careful when I'm talking about it cuz I was at my mechanics one time

253
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
And

254
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
We adjust

255
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,103
Started to make money off this and

256
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
And I was telling him a little bit about it

257
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,015
And there was another lady sitting in the waiting room part

258
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
And

259
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
She overheard us

260
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,879
And she's like she said something like a

261
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,463
Well that's just immoral what you're doing and I'm like

262
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:43,839
She's like I have a daughter in college right now and I can't believe that you would

263
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
And I'm like Oh my goodness

264
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
I have to be careful cuz

265
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,519
You know she interpreted it she wanted her daughter to be able to buy

266
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,823
The textbooks at the cheapest price

267
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
I suppose

268
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,735
And here we are buying them cheap and selling them back hire to her daughter is kind of how

269
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
She saw it

270
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
I was not right

271
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
Yeah except

272
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Well

273
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
I've been thinking about where the money these guys are making

274
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
He's coming soon

275
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,095
They're a couple non Arbitrage e-waste

276
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,679
You could argue that Bob and Kenny are making money here

277
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,751
Because they're providing a service they are providing something of value

278
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,823
Taking a book off someone's hands when no one else wants it

279
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,663
Or you could argue they're making money as a reward for taking a risk

280
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
But no one else wants to

281
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,759
It's possible they'll get stuck with a bunch of these books

282
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,855
Bob said there's a copy of nursing care plan 7th edition he would love to get rid

283
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,183
I think the easiest explanation is just Arbitrage

284
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,279
They figured out some little piece of information that other people don't know

285
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
They found a fishing hole

286
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
The People Eater passed over

287
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
Just didn't know about

288
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
The thing about free money opportunities

289
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,983
Is that they don't laugh

290
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
This is why Arbitrage is so rare

291
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,919
If other people decide to get in on this textbook game imagine a giant used bookstore with

292
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
Plenty of money in storage space

293
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
If they want in

294
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,063
There will be a bidding war for those textbooks in the off-season

295
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
You won't be able to get them

296
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
For $4

297
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,719
The price Gap will close and everyone will be better off

298
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,535
The students selling books will get more money for them

299
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
The people buying them when classes start

300
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
Will get them a little cheaper than they do now

301
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
Everyone win

302
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
Except Kenny and Bop

303
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
They will be out of

304
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,079
It's possible someone is actually already discovered the same seek

305
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,407
Bob and Kenny Evan getting a suspicious number of order

306
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
I'm someone named

307
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
Mary Campbell

308
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,759
So Mary Campbell

309
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
Is our biggest

310
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Book buyer

311
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
Yeah yeah

312
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,463
They know Mary Campbell is not some really voracious reader or ambitious students

313
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Because

314
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,023
She buys multiple copies

315
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
Of the same textbook

316
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
Her address is a PO Box

317
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Kentucky

318
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,191
Maybe this Mary Campbell has figured out a better system

319
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,495
A better way to make money off their books

320
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,311
A way to out Arbitrage the arbitrageur

321
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
Or maybe there's something even bigger goal

322
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
It possible there's no

323
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
Real person named Mary Campbell

324
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,527
It might just be what we don't know

325
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
Like that's what

326
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
The mystery of United

327
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
I could be Mary Campbell as a computer program

328
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,439
Buying and selling According to some algra

329
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,791
Bob and Kenny say the word in the used book Market is at Mary Campbell

330
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,351
Maybe amazon.com itself

331
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
Amazon has this textbook rental Pro

332
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
So maybe it's buying books for that

333
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,263
We sent a reporter to that post office in

334
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
Kentucky she has to mail clerk about the PO box

335
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
Number and the guy Shadow His colleague hey

336
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,175
Someone wants to know about Mary Campbell

337
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
I couldn't tell us much

338
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,623
They did say there was no person named Mary Campbell who came to get the mail

339
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:52,767
That was how I show ended back in 2014 we will have a quick update

340
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
After the break

Our show originally aired back in 2014

347
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:23,743
Are we called Bob Peterson this week to check in and ask him if he's still in the textbook Arbitrage

348
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,583
Yes it's still profitable

349
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
And so we continue to do it

350
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:36,031
I think that maybe a day and next three or four years that it's just not worth the effort

351
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Brittany Moore

352
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,871
Any margins have come down a little bit

353
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
But

354
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
There's still money to be made

355
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,735
And it's still just a numbers game

356
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Also Bob says

357
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,087
Mary Campbell is still a mystery

358
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
She is disappeared

359
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
So we don't see her

360
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:59,071
Hardly any more at all now I think he's probably been well over a year since he sold a book to Mary Campbell

361
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
We have not given up on the search for Mary Campbell if you know where she is
