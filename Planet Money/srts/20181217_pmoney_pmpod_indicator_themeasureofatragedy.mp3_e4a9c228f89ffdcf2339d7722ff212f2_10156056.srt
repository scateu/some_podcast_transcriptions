00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,096
This is a bonus episode here in the Planet Money feet and it's for a special occasion

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,376
Other podcast

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,168
The indicator from Planet Money

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,704
Turned one-year-old this month

5
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:12,800
We have picked out one of our favorite episodes from the past year

6
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:13,568
To Mark the occasion

7
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,640
If you don't listen to the indicator it's like Planet Money

8
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,432
But it comes out every weekday

9
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,224
It's always 10 minutes or less

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,272
We think of it as a daily economics

11
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,064
Crash course on what's happening in the

12
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:28,416
So he was a favorite episode of the indicator from Planet Money

13
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,440
It ran back in June

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,096
The Venezuelan economy has

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,264
Years of Economic mismanagement and a worsening political crisis have led to a recession that has almost no parallel

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,032
In recent memory

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,080
Explaining just how bad things

18
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,920
I've gotten is also really hard because the normal economic indicator

19
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,456
There's that we used to measure countries

20
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
Economy

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
I started to sound so

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,296
Crazy so unfathomable

23
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,600
Did it feels impossible to get our heads around

24
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:01,440
Bridge Apple inflation in Venezuela right now is running it almost 20

25
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,208
G5

26
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:02,976
Thousand

27
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,000
Percent a year

28
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,304
And that one estimate almost nine out of ten piece

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072
People are living

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,912
This was an upper middle-income country that has become

31
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,216
Super poor country

32
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,360
And so the numbers changed so dramatically that are the reality of people changes so dramatically

33
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
That babe

34
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Is it

35
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
Is no longer

36
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,272
Can be captured by the traditional numbers

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
That's Ricardo hausmann

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,112
He is a Venezuelan Economist based

39
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
Harvard

40
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,696
And if we understand what's been happening in his native tongue

41
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
Country he's had to be inventive

42
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,816
If you had to construct an economic indicator that did not exist

43
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
One that communicates the full-scale.

44
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,912

On The Chew today what Ricardo came up with

00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,688
What is indicator reveals what conventional economic numbers sometimes missed when it country is rapidly

Throughout the 2000s

61
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
The Venezuelan government borrowed at

62
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
Haunted money

63
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
To pay for social programs and other things

64
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,328
And the government felt safe borrowing the money because it's a

65
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,168
Economy produce a lot of oil and oil prices were really high

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,824
The government borrowed so much money that went oil prices fell a few years ago it didn't have enough money left over to pay both

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Both of the programs and

68
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
To pay off a

69
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Stats

70
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
In one of the government's

71
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,248
Responses within start printing money and raising wage

72
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Bridge workers

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
That led to hyper

74
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:09,184
Not only that but the government had also taken over big parts of the economy from the private sector

75
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
And then mismanaged

76
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,328
Combination of hyperinflation and this mismanagement led to a big shortage

77
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,400
Even basic items like toilet paper became hard

78
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,240
Find and therefore incredibly expensive when people could buy them

79
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,848
Ricardo hausmann says that people in developed countries like relatively rich country such as

80
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Does the US

81
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,944
Don't necessarily have a useful frame of reference for understanding just

82
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
How bad things have gotten

83
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
In Venezuela

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,624
For example the US has been traumatized by the Great Recession of 2008

85
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,184
A 2009 etcetera

86
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
Well that recession is probably

87
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
10th

88
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
The size of

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
What happened

90
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
In Venezuela

91
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,656
Wow how do you explain something that's 10 times bigger

92
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,264
Traditional metrics like inflation and unemployment don't really work when a country is in free

93
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,592
In the United States inflation is about 2% a year

94
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,664
That just means that the average price of the stuff that we America

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,968
5 goes about 2% every year

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,320
So what does it mean for a country to have almost 25000 percent in

97
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,600
Inflation like Venezuela

98
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,720
As for unemployment government simply stopped reporting that number more than 2 years ago

99
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,815
So I was trying to communicate in all the collapse in Livingston

100
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Gender

101
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
It's it's

102
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
It's very hard

103
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,935
To make those numbers

104
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Baby intelligible

105
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,799
Foreign economic catastrophe this severe

106
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,127
The figures for inflation or unemployment can feel like abstraction

107
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,455
Sara Carter got to work on an indicator that's not just

108
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Concrete

109
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Imprecise

110
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
But when it really gets the human toll

111
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
The crisis

112
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
Has been exact

113
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,415
He starts with a fact about the Venezuelan economy

114
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,463
It's both astonishing and depressing

115
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
And it's this

116
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,071
The minimum wage in Venezuela is also the median wage

117
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,911
This means that more than half of Venezuelan workers are in the minimum wage

118
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
So when the government

119
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,775
Increases the minimum wage most of the Venezuelan population gets away

120
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:05,151
Grace and keep up with Rising prices the government has been increasing the minimum wage a lot in the last cup

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,247
But two months ago for example the government raise it by a hundred

122
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
55%

123
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
Another

124
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
Crazy number

125
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,391
But how much more can a Venezuelan really Buy on that wage

126
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,951
Give me the price of everything is going up so fast

127
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
People's wages might be going up a lot but if prices are going up even more than living standards in the country are still getting worse

128
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,447
Just how much worse is the question Ricardo wanted to

129
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
And he wanted to explain it in simple.

130
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
So here's what he came up

131
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,151
So we decided to measure for example the income of people

132
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,223
In terms of the calories you can buy

133
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
Verde

134
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
So you know

135
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,671
How many calories can you buy if you were to spend 100% of your income at the cheapest available calories

136
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
Works Ricardo his team tractel prices

137
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,791
Different foods in Venezuela change from month to month

138
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,399
And each month you would find the food they gave you the most calories for each Boulevard

139
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
What is the Venezuelan

140
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
At the food cost

141
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
In other words he was looking for the cheapest

142
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
Food available

143
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,871
And since Venezuela has shortages of food the cheapest food available would sometimes change

144
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
Pasta or corn flour

145
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
But now even those food

146
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,527
Unaffordable so right now the cheapest food is the gecko

147
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
Take a typical Venezuelan worker

148
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
Someone who makes the minimum wage

149
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:23,999
If you spent every single Boulevard from his weight on that cheapest food available

150
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,815
How many calories could you buy in one day

151
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
Here is the incredible in French

152
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Devastating ant

153
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:36,543
This a calculation that went from buying 57000 calories a day in 2012

154
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,103
Buying less than $900

155
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
Calories today 900

156
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Calories

157
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
That's today's Planet money into

158
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
900 calories

159
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
All the calories

160
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,087
Set the minimum wage will get you in Venezuela after

161
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
You working an entire day

162
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,999
Which means I do know if a person normally spends over 2000 calories a day

163
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
It means that a worker

164
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
It cannot

165
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
Being himself

166
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
Let alone his family

167
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,215
And that's assuming he doesn't spend anything in clothing in France

168
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Asportation

169
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
In

170
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
And medicines

171
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
And housing

172
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,151
It's so it just gives you a sense of how

173
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Catastrophic

174
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
Maggie's doll collection

175
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,527
Put that 900 calories in context

176
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,391
In United States you can buy more than a hundred thousand calories in one day on the minimum wage

177
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
Venezuelan people are starving

178
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
Anacardo told us about it

179
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,559
A couple of other similar statistics that also tell the story

180
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,143
You'll see we we did as we measured it just an ex

181
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
How many eggs can you buy

182
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:42,079
Well before you know another you could buy several dozen eggs now you can buy two eggs

183
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
That's it

184
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,431
Who acts and that was important for us to calculate because

185
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
It's not just calories it's also protein

186
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
Hey that people need

187
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,343
And so you know right now people in Venezuela

188
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
If I 2X

189
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,999
A recently people have calculated what is the cost of a Big Mac how long does it take you to work

190
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,607
To make enough to buy a Big Mac and in Venezuela right now that's a month-and-a-half

191
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
2x a day

192
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
Order afford a Big Mac

193
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,519
The Venezuelan worker would have to save every single ball of our he earned

194
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
A month

195
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
And a half

196
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,407
The inevitable result of this has been that Venezuelans are losing a lot of

197
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,735
Survey from three universities in Venezuela founded

198
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,063
The average Venezuelan lost 24 pounds last year

199
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Because they could not afford to

200
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:30,463
And hundreds of thousands of children are at risk of dying from starvation and malnutrition

201
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,279
This economic collapse has been accompanied by a

202
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
A societal collapse

203
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
In Law and Order

204
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Braswell

205
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
And even though the government has stopped

206
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:44,031
Publishing the data on that there are credible estimates show in the Venezuela probably now has the highest murder rate

207
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:50,431
The world the situation has become so intolerable that a staggering number of Venezuelans are just leaving the car

208
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:57,087
Ricardo and his colleagues estimate that almost 10% of the Venezuelan population emigrated in the past year

209
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
That is almost 3 million people

210
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:04,255
If we were to try to analogize that to it happening in the United States for instance where there's

211
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
300 and something million that would be the equivalent

212
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,887
30 million Americans leaving the country

213
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Every single year

214
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,239
This is astonishing and I'm wondering if there's any

215
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
Precedent

216
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
I mean

217
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,359
This is

218
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,663
A migration of Siri and proportion

219
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
A butt in Syria

220
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
People fleeing linode

221
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,343
Insecurity people fleeing the war

222
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
The people fearing

223
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
Imminent death

224
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
Am in Venezuela

225
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,279
It must be something as serious as

226
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Fearing imminent death

227
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
Regenerate

228
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
Is that magnitude of enough

229
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,799
That was an episode of the indicator from Planet Money and it ran in June

230
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
Since then

231
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,663
Inflation in Venezuela has gone from 25000 percent

232
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
More than a million

233
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,039
To see how Venezuelans are doing better or worse

234
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
Put in calorie terms with our house Monroe earlier this month

235
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
That a day's work

236
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
The median wage but not by you

237
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
1.7

238
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,511
And to get a pound of cheese

239
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
It would take

240
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
8 days

241
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:16,191
The indicator from Planet Money is there help you make sense of the numbers that matter in the world

242
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
It's every weekday afternoon 10 minutes or less

243
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,591
