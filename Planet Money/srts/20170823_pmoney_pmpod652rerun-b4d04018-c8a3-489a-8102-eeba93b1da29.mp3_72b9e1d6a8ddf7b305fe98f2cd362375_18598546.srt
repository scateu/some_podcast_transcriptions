00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:05,120
Hey it's Stacey Vanek Smith here today's episode originally ran in 2015

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,168
And we have an update for you at the end

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,704
A very delicious up

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,824
My dad is the kind of guy who does not buy a lot of stuff for himself

5
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,384
But when I was a kid there was this one indulge

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,992
You go to the supermarket and bring home a package of these particular cookie

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,272
Hydrox

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
Which looked

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,856
Well they looked a lot like Oreos

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,648
But my dad insisted they were

11
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:28,928
Better

12
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,208
These were perfect

13
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:35,840
Hydrox is the Oreo knock-off but they were not Hydrox were the original sandwich

14
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,144
What you know two chocolate wafers with cream in the middle

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
They've been around for almost a hundred

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,264
And then one day in 1999

17
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,288
Hydrox cookies

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,056
He's disappeared

19
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,336
The company stop making

20
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,640
Oreos it team did won the cookie War

21
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
A my dad was

22
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,272
But earlier this year I saw a little news story

23
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,576
But a man who now 16 years later

24
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,392
Is hard at work trying to take possession of a hydraulic name

25
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,184
He's trying to discover whatever the secret

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,208
Formal headbands

27
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,744
You trying to bring the cookie back

28
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,352
Welcome to Planet Money I'm David kestenbaum Robert Smith

29
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,888
There is a huge

30
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,960
Garbage dump bucket fail products out there

31
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,568
Cookies Luxury Cars toys Nology sneakers

32
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
Most businesses spend their lives trying to stay out of this. But there's some people who were

33
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,736
Wanted to get

34
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
What to look for buried treasure

35
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,088
Sam the show one man dig up a very old cookie

36
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
Sublime

37
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,696
Cookie some people say is much better than that other one

38
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
With your real

39
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,584
How can I go had an Oreo cookie

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
Oieo

Ellia kassoff

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,712
Grew up in one of those families where if a package of cookies from the supermarket somehow made it in

49
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
To the house

50
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
It was hard to think about anything else

51
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
It just sat there in your mind

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,856
We have cookies from the supermarket

53
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
In the house

54
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
You can't believe it

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928
His mom is going to help

56
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
She literally went through the hole

57
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Al Haram

58
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
A recipe box and

59
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:48,192
Crossed out the sugar in honey Crosstown flower butthole weed that smells like we were like the first ones to go to health

60
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
Food stops in SF

61
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
Self

62
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,056
It was a big thing for me to have a Hydrox in the house

63
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,384
Go treasure hunting thing started as sort of a lark

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,480
When Elliot got older he's working as a recruiter for tech companies he's making good money

65
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:04,064
But then he noticed that his favorite childhood candy Astro Pop

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
Went away everything little lollipop shaped like rocket

67
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
Sigelei called at the CEO and said

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,048
Can I buy the rights to make this thing's astropop and ZO6 sure

69
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
And so Elliot brought Astro pops back from the dead

70
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Enneathought

71
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:22,240
You know what this is what I want to do I'm going to find all these iconic brands

72
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
And bring them back to

73
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
I'm going to build

74
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
Empire

75
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,384
Which is when he decided to go for a hike

76
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
The original sandwich

77
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,248
The cookie that at one point had been on store shelves across the

78
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
Immediately though there was this problem

79
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
The name Hydrox

80
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,368
Was trademarked

81
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,952
Originally by the company Sunshine that it made the first cookies over

82
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
100 years ago

83
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,536
Sunshine had been bought by the elves

84
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
Keebler

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
What you been gobbled up by Kellogg

86
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,400
So Kellogg's is huge company

87
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,192
Control the trademark on the knee

88
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:57,312
Ellie looked into trademark law and he learned if someone owns a trademark but isn't using it

89
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
There is a chance you can snack

90
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,896
We had to show proof that they weren't using it

91
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,224
You called Kellogg's and be like hey you guys can do anywhere hydraulics

92
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:11,392
It's it is a methodology that we have is kind of a little proprietary thing cuz if other people knew how to do it

93
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
I wasn't going to let that

94
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,744
So I called up a trademark expert

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Mark McKenna

96
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,095
And ask him is this right can someone just walked in

97
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,679
Grab a hundred-year-old trademarks on Lyon this whole history

98
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,751
It seems a little weird cuz a trademark is like a kind of property

99
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
And if you think of this like LAN

100
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:33,151
Like hey I know she mowed your lawn for a while so I'm just going to take a little part of your property

101
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Crazy right

102
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
I'm thinking about trademarks

103
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
They're a funny kind of property

104
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,391
Sally ideas that you know trademarks are not property in a full sense like other things

105
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
Trademark rights

106
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,999
Really exist for the purpose of helping

107
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:53,887
Producers signal something to Consumers that you know we are the source of this product

108
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,703
So treatments are different than a patent

109
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
Owning the rights to a song

110
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
A trademark is this really

111
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,591
Practical thing it serves these two purposes

112
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
What prevents confusion for consumers

113
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:10,527
So if you buy a Coke and you buy it says Coke on there with a little r that means registered trademark

114
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,319
You know that you are about to get

115
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,879
Pure Coke goodness from that can

116
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
Cuz Coca-Cola is the only one is allowed.

117
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,303
Getting a trademark as it makes it so Coca-Cola doesn't have to worry about fakes

118
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
About someone

119
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,423
Putting out crummy cook with the same you no label on the can

120
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,215
It means I can spend a lot of money on that

121
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,799
Appetizing and not worried that someone else is going to free ride on all that work they're doing building up

122
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,663
Yes I told the trademark is this relationship between a company

123
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,039
And its customers and so if that relationship is broken if a company stops using the trademark

124
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
There isn't really anything to protect anymore

125
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623
Trademark is deemed

126
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Abandoned

127
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,999
Is that the legal term abandonment like as if you left the dog by the side of the road or something

128
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:57,375
That's right it did. It's a doctrine of Abandonment so I couldn't Siri just grab up like Enron

129
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
Amateur and run will be one you want

130
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
Put on like a box of pasta

131
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
And ronzoni or something

132
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
The San Francisco treat

133
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
The energy trading tree

134
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
The bankruptcy

135
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
I think it works

136
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,015
The in order for Elliott to get the hydroxide Marquis had to show that

137
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,551
Kellogg had no plans

138
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
And

139
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,647
Elia was cagey about this but I pulled up the documents

140
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,463
Filed and one of the things you say to the wicked

141
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Pedia entry

142
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,047
But also includes this letter

143
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,607
From Kellogg's basically he wrote to Kellogg Shanghai

144
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:35,007
I understand you're still making Hydrox cookies can you tell me if you only make them is topping crumble or whole cookies where can I find

145
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,663
So he's pretending to be a customer

146
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
Alex logo on the top

147
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Thank you for contacting

148
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,087
We are sorry to tell you that this item did not have enough fans and was discontinued

149
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,951
They just said it right there they just like toss this out to a fan but of course Elia is thinking

150
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
That's it that's what I need

151
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,839
If I sent this into the trademark office and they had to send the documents to Kellogg's also

152
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Kellogg's

153
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
Had to be notified so we sat had to send the paperwork to their attorneys and say you're on your on notice that

154
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,079
That you're not using Hydrox and you're going to lose the trademark

155
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
And I never replied

156
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
About a year later

157
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,271
The stuff takes time and we got an email from the US patent and trademark office saying

158
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
Okay

159
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
You can use hydraulics

160
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,415
Have that feeling you got that saying it's yours all my God it's

161
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:30,047
You know how I can't believe it's mine you all decided to control this cookie is that like your dad

162
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,863
It is a very bizarre feeling

163
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
I called Kellogg by the way

164
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
And did not hear

165
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
It's like you don't care

166
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
I think they made it

167
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,055
Noelia finally had the name but

168
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,663
Only the name just those six letters Hydrox

169
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,967
You can get the logo you can get the packaging

170
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,271
He definitely did not get a copy of the secret rest

171
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,087
He's going to have to figure out how to make the Cookie by himself

172
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
He's got to do a bunch

173
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
Detective work

174
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,719
And where are you going to get your hands on a cookie that went away in 1999

175
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Craigslist

176
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,351
I went online and I found someone had a sealed Hydrox

177
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
Cookie package from 1998

178
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:11,263
And they were selling it on Craigslist in Upstate New York

179
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,383
I don't like well I'm going to buy that thing this research costumes $7

180
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,711
Few days later the package arrived in the mail a package of 50

181
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
15 year old cookie

182
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
Look fine

183
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
Didn't actually taste them

184
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,439
Because he was interested in what was on the package the ingredient list

185
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,231
Man cookies are accomplished

186
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
Here's some ingredients

187
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:39,167
Is flour wheat flour niacin reduced iron thiamine mononitrate vitamin B1 riboflavin cocoa

188
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
Also degerminated yellow

189
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,799
Cornflower the key ingredients were really the Coco and the vanilla

190
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
Because Hydrox everyone

191
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
It had this darker

192
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
Chocolate taste

193
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Oreo day

194
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,527
A look around for a while and I found a place I can get them the original Coco

195
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,855
Any kind of place that it provided the vanilla for the original cookies

196
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
I was going to sell

197
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,463
Is it vanilla number 6 5 3 2

198
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:08,863
Yeah I mean it really is that specific yeah I mean fortunately we you know the Manila vanilla manufacturer had

199
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
You know they still had all the records of what vanilla as they used in

200
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,007
And for years and years and years what is the net worth of vanilla

201
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,591
I can't really divulge that really cuz it's

202
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,919
Yeah okay there in Texas that's all I can tell you

203
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
To the guy is so

204
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,807
Secretive especially for like sending all these secret notes to Kellogg's and such I guess he's

205
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,623
He's worried he's going to snatch his like hard workers

206
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,999
I think the whole cookie business is this way like everything's like Trade Secrets no one talks about how they make

207
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,863
Elias got the ingredients right he didn't eat the food scientists

208
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
The lab

209
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,935
To make some prototype cook

210
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,823
But like how do you know you got it right I mean you can recreate the logo cuz you

211
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:55,199
How did the cookie actually tastes like taste is a funny thing to try and remember

212
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
So we had to find some expert

213
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
When was Linda Miller

214
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
Grew up in South Carolina eating lots of Hydra

215
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
Hydrox meets all your needs

216
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
Comfort

217
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
Great taste

218
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
Available

219
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
Whenever you need it

220
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
It was

221
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
I mean I think that was

222
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
The best life there was

223
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
Hydrox life

224
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Yes

225
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:24,383
And brand is a powerful thing I mean there's the cookie itself but when Linda sees the whole thing together like

226
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
The name package

227
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
All of a sudden she's thinking of her first date with her

228
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
This is one of the things they bonded.

229
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Hydrox

230
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
And you really appreciate

231
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,135
This is a kid that people have such strong feelings but

232
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:40,255
Now that we bring this up I guess we were an oil family we were an oil family from way back that's just what we bought

233
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
We were hydroxide

234
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,583
People really pick sides or one of the other

235
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,935
And for Linda it's not just like she feels like Hydrox are better than Oreo

236
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
She doesn't like Oreos

237
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
She said they're gross

238
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
Once you have a hydraulic

239
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
You don't want anything else

240
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
Because it's just a fake

241
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,783
But they're both cookies and they're pretty similar you know Chocolate Wafers on the outside

242
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575
Handsome cream in the middle

243
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
No they're not similar

244
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
They're not

245
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
They are similar

246
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
Okay well

247
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
They're the same color

248
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,583
You sure are a big part of it isn't just a memory

249
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Lily Spring spa

250
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
I'm positive

251
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,215
Have you had a Hydrox cookie

252
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
David

253
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
Not in probably 20 years

254
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,847
Ellie enlisted Linda and her husband Rogers taste tester

255
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
And one day Linda says

256
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
Some prototype cookies showed up in the mail

257
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,039
I was very secret I was just in this plain envelope

258
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
I think what they were for cookies

259
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
Four cookies of a

260
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
Cookie recipe

261
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
We were taste-testing

262
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,071
And how did they taste

263
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:54,239
Well you know one was better than the other and that's all I'm going to tell you

264
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
Secret society plotting Revolution

265
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
You wish you were

266
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,431
When you talk to people like Linda you think maybe Hydrox actually has a chance maybe it does taste

267
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
I remember

268
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
And yet there is the fact

269
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
Did Hydrox went away

270
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
You felt

271
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,647
Yeah I never really know what the story was just like one day it wasn't there in the supermarket

272
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
Good anymore

273
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,951
So I tracked in someone who does know this

274
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Carolyn Burns

275
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
She was head of marketing of the cookie division

276
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
When Hydrox was made at

277
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
Keebler

278
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
You know the place with the owl

279
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:26,495
Those of us that worked at Keebler for any length of time actually take great pride in being l

280
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
Carlynton hydroxide for a couple

281
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,895
When is the thing that Elliot kassoff worked so hard to get

282
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
The name

283
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,759
100 years ago when Hydrox was launched it was meant to invoke Purity law

284
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Like water

285
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
Hydrogen dioxide

286
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,159
But by the 1990s she says that was not what the name made people think of

287
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,719
Get your sounded like a cleaning agent

288
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,559
You know like you cleaned out the sink where the floor

289
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
Exactly what Clorox Clorox

290
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
You know and then hydrogen

291
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
Yeah it sounded very, Kauai

292
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
Sales are dropping year after

293
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,639
She said they tried to save the cookie they rebranded it as droxies and they re

294
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
Reformulated it

295
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
But that didn't stop

296
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
At some point she says

297
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,063
It did not make sense for Hydrox to take up shelf space of the Superman

298
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,367
Any stores want stuff on their shelves

299
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
The people are bringing up to the cash register

300
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
And at some point sales just fell below that threshold

301
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
What do you think about the idea of bringing it back

302
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
How to stand a chance

303
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
No

304
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
Why not

305
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:36,383
Oreo dominate that market and has a lot of money investing

306
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
Bran I asked ellia kassoff

307
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
The fact that his little company was going

308
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
Up against Oreo

309
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
Going up again

310
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Big cookie

311
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
Is it true Oreo

312
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Is the best selling cookie

313
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
In the United States

314
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
Actually the best selling cookie in the world

315
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
In the whole world

316
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Yeah

317
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
Can you beat Oreo

318
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
Beat

319
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
Beats

320
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:02,751
I think from a flavor perspective absolutely I mean from a Salesman

321
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
You know what I

322
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
That's

323
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
I would love to and I think we have an opportunity especially with Millennials at love original

324
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,319
Products and batteries are the number one cookie in the world

325
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
Hey Galaxy. I am high

326
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
The truth is Elia doesn't have to

327
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Beat

328
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
The world has changed a lot since Hydrox

329
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
One thing

330
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
La can sell them on Amazon

331
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,375
So it's okay if they just have a smaller market share

332
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
Thousand people in each day

333
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,471
Doesn't have to justify be on the shelves of major stores

334
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,103
In supermarkets have changed when we were kids there was only one or two of every kind of Cook

335
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
Cookie competition was all or nothing this really like

336
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,735
Will orioles survive or will hydroxyl Drive

337
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,575
I just went to a convenience store during your studious like a tiny convenience store

338
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,183
Ensure just the kinds of Oreos I saw on the Shelf there is the regular Oreo

339
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Is the Oriole golden

340
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Oreo Double stuff

341
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
Golden double stuf Oreo

342
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
Mega stuf

343
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
Which is something bigger than double

344
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
. mint

345
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
Oreo Oreo Thins

346
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
I get it a lot of cookies

347
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
A lot of Coke

348
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,359
So do you have a name like Hydrox protest some recognition give you a little bit of edge

349
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
That could be worth

350
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
SLA if you could send me a cookie

351
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
And he said no

352
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
I'm going to send you a box

353
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Do we get the box

354
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
We got the box have it down here

355
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,207
I've kept this close because I want to

356
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
To capture the moment

357
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
When your childhood dreams I'll come back to this

358
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,607
I'll come Crashing Down

359
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
For the sup

360
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495

Look at that has hydroxide

362
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Before you eat it

363
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
Tell me what you remember taking

364
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
It was a thinking man

365
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,527
Now what it taste like

366
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
Not so sweet

367
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,183
Like a chocolate flavor was very present

368
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,999
Remember that feeling being more centered

369
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,839
They're still getting production issues out of the way

370
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
Like this is

371
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,167
This is what you want some milk I bought some milk

372
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
Okay yeah

373
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Milk

374
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,615
This is exciting I haven't had one in

375
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Set alarm.

376
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,623
I thought I remembered what they taste like

377
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
It's good

378
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559
This brings back memories of me watching Saturday morning

379
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,399
I should grab cookies for anyone walk

380
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
Are they late right

381
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
Dress like an Oreo

382
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
You mean Oreos taste

383
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,991
A lot of work to put it to resurrect and cookie

384
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
It was already basically there

385
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:01,439
Hey it's easy here again.

386
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:06,047
That was in 2015 in a moment we check in with Elliot and see how Hydrox

387
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Is doing now

388
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,143

When we first ran the story a lot of you wrote into us about how excited you were for Anew Hydra

393
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Some of you sent it

394
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,415
Pictures when the first orders arrived in the mail

395
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:38,559
At the time hydroxide just become available on Amazon and Elliot was hoping to get into some actual stores

396
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,375
So we talked to him this week and ask how's it going

397
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
He says

398
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:47,263
It's a hit it's working you can get Hydrox in about 4000 stores across the

399
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:52,639
Elliot is in fact working on his next big project not an abandoned trademark this time

400
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,199
He wants to buy Nestle's American candy

401
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
But it cost so much he needs investors

402
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,575
Noelia is using Hydraulics to help him recruit

403
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Business partner

404
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623

405
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
To try and recruit legendary investor Warren Buffett

406
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
Here's the letter d.

407
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
Give us our casa

408
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,655
I can remember the days at my grandfather's grocery store when Hydrox cookies far outsold Oreos

409
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
After biting into one that you sent me

410
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,519
I got with the markets verdict from the earlier day

411
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
I think you have a winner

412
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
Warren Buffett

413
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,431
Warren Buffett loves Hydrox

414
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,551
He did not however love the investment opportunity he turned it down but a very nice protection
