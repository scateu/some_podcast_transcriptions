Go right

12
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,456
Hey it's Noel King here

13
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,808
You probably heard that earlier this week Amazon announced the location of its new head

14
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,904
Headquarters and it picked two places to pick Northern Virginia and New York City

15
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,488
An Amazon says each place is going to get about 25000

16
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
City jobs

17
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,840
No that was the end of a very long

18
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240
Bidding war there were dozens of states and cities that were courting Amazon by offering them billions of dollars in tax

19
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,824
And some other stuff too there was this one time in Georgia

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,176
Where the mayor said okay will carve out 345 Acres

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:56,576
We'll make a new town and we will let Jeff Bezos be the mayor or the CEO or the king or what

22
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
Whatever he wants

23
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,648
We think that mayor was just joking

24
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,976
But a bunch of you wrote to us with the same question which was basically

25
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,816
Why do cities and states offer these huge tax incentives

26
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,912
And when they do it does it actually make sense is it in their interest

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,704
Back in 2006

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,288
16 Stacey Vanek Smith and I reported a story on why this

29
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,872
Kansas City is kind of a unique

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,688
It's not one city it's actually two

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,832
Any split right down the middle so that half of Kansas city is in Kansas and half of Kansas city is in Missouri

32
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,392
There is a road running down the middle of the sea

33
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
City that divides it

34
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
It is called

35
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
Stateline Road

36
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,792
We are in the car driving along

37
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
Stateline Road okay Kansas is on the left and the reason right

38
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,008
Phillips 66 is in

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
Missouri

40
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Station in Missouri

41
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,104
And the Capitol Federal

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
Prairie Village

43
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
Is in Kansas

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
Yeah

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,016
Yeah people make a really big deal out of

46
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,320
We were hearing all the stuff about this

47
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856
Huge rivalry

48
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Between the two

49
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
States

50
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,976
So we pulled off of Stateline Road into a little shopping center on the

51
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Kansas I'd

52
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
To see what

53
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
People would say about

54
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,328
What are people in Missouri like

55
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
You look cute

56
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
We friendly we got we are good

57
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
Be around

58
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
Wilbury

59
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
A very hard-working p

60
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,080
Are people from Missouri like

61
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,176
A little differently people from Kansas

62
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,736
Well

63
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
Yeah

64
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,344
Apparently people from Kansas are a little bit

65
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
Navi

66
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
Rochelle Graham from Kansas says

67
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
We are not snobby

68
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
What are people from Kansas like

69
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
I would say very down-to-earth

70
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
Helpful kind

71
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
Big sense of community

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
We heard all kinds of

73
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
People from Kansas told

74
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
Missouri relay

75
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
City Folk

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
Real country values

77
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616
Are people from Missouri told us

78
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Kansas

79
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
We're aloof and verb

80
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Bad drivers

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
We wanted to get to the bottom of this

82
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
And then there in the parking lot we met

83
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
Quinton Donnelly

84
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
Who broke it down for us like

85
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
Kansas people are

86
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
Very short minded

87
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
Very short minded

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Yo

89
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
The Kansas

90
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
If you saw me and Noel

91
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,400
One of us one of us was from Missouri what would you guess

92
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
Allstate

93
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
I say you're more

94
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
Okay Kansas

95
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
She looks like

96
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
You know she gets the party started

97
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
And I look

98
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Like

99
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
You look like you like to read books

100
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Call Alton

101
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
He called you a nerd

102
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,720
I know it's like the Raiders versus the party game

103
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,584
But look there rivalry between Kansas and Missouri goes beyond trash talk

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,448
While we were down there people kept telling us there is a war going on along the border between

105
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,032
End this war is over something very important

106
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
It's a war over job

107
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:03,456
The two states are fighting to lure companies to their state and not the one across State Line Road

108
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
And they're spending millions of dollars

109
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,808
This is something that's happening all over the

110
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,648
It's just that usually it happens over much greater distances

111
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
It's like California and New York

112
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
Competing over a tech company

113
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,047
Or Georgia and New Jersey battling it out over car

114
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,863
Kansas Missouri you can see this happening

115
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Right up close

116
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
Because the tug-of-war is

117
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,703
Literally across the street

118
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,639
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Noel King and I'm Stacey Vanek Smith today on the show The kansas-missouri

119
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,759
A close-up look at what politicians like to call job creation

120
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,575
What looks a lot of times a little bit more like jobs

121
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:47,487
And we'll tell you the story of the fight over one company you probably know it you may have even eaten one of their quesadilla burger

00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
Just like in any War

135
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
There are General

136
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
I am a non-commissioned officer

137
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,287
Grace I'm actually know it I'm actually just a soldier

138
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,359
Blake Shrek works for a Chamber of Commerce in Kansas

139
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,199
And it's his job to make sure companies come to Kansas and stay in can

140
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,295
Jesus really Dapper guy he's got sick white hair

141
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
He wears jeans and Blazers

142
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
Izzy's tortoiseshell glasses

143
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,719
And his office is in this old sprawling Victorian house

144
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
It's really lovely place

145
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
But make no mistake

146
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327
This is Blake

147
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
War room

148
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,679
He's got all these top secret documents on his desk with

149
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,751
Code names for the companies that use trying to attract

150
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,335
Because Blake doesn't want his Rivals from

151
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
Say across the sea

152
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,175
Missouri to know which companies are in play

153
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
What are some of the code names

154
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,527
Okay hand sign

155
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
Here's the latest we've got project George

156
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Project Scout

157
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,327
Project standard project view twin Kodiak Lantern LSA Sesame 2

158
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
It's just the last month

159
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,167
Avis fantasy that Sesame 2 is like

160
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
A fast food company like Burger King

161
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,079
I can't stop thinking about what Sesame one was

162
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,687
An oldies codenames all the secrecy Blake's job wasn't always

163
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
Yeah he's been doing this for 30 years

164
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,111
And he said for him the war really ramped up about 10 years ago with one company

165
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Applebee's

166
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
At the time Applebee's have their headquarters on Blake side

167
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Encanta

168
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,815
And they were doing well they were growing and they came to Blake and they said

169
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
We need a bigger building

170
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:07,007
They called him up and said look we'd like to stay in Kansas we want to build this new headquarters big fancy new place

171
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
But then there's like a shift

172
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Skin tone

173
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
And they tell him

174
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
You know we're pretty big deal we can go where we want to

175
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,759
And we may you know go to Missouri I'm so what can you do for us

176
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
Blake did not want to lose Apple

177
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,879
They were big employer they were a big company

178
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,671
Point of Pride for the state of Kansas

179
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
So Applebee's suggested that Kansas give it a text

180
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
A big one

181
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
Like how about for the next

182
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
10 years we basically pay no property

183
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:38,751
Are feeling what's a little bit of the time was that that just wasn't done if you really want to be in our community you need to pay

184
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,335
Full about this puts Blake and Kansas in a tough position

185
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,199
Right even give Applebee's what it's asking for then they're going to lose a lot of property tax revenue

186
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
On the other hand

187
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
Kansas said no it would lose

188
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
Even more

189
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,135
The corporate taxes from a multi-billion-dollar company

190
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,695
Payroll taxes for hundreds of employees

191
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,255
And all of the property taxes from Apple

192
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
Tens of millions of dollars

193
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
We're on the line

194
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,375
It calls the mayor and says

195
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,703
We can't let this payroll I mean it was a huge deal

196
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,263
Leave the state but we really need to step up

197
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
So Blake ways these two kind of crummy options

198
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
Any decides

199
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
We need to give Applebee's what they want

200
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,455
He makes his case to the local politicians

201
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
In the end

202
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
Kansas takes his advice

203
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
It makes an offer

204
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
Applebee's

205
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,927
You stay we will give you more than 12 million dollars in tax breaks

206
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
And some other part

207
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,023
Parks we will also fix up a bunch of Roads around for your shiny new

208
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Headquarters will be

209
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:38,143
And even then Blake wasn't sure they'd be able to keep Applebee's in Kansas

210
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
Finally the company called him

211
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,031
Heather on speakerphone and they said Kansas has the choice

212
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
And then we're going to like

213
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,639
Yeah in the background but we are very happy

214
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:53,247
But we can't just jump around doing End Zone celebration we just had to say what we're glad to have you

215
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
And it's right around this time that the

216
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
Kansas Missouri rivalry

217
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,135
The war for job starts to heat up

218
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,207
Because both States put in place incentive programs

219
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
Tueller companies in

220
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,815
Lisa Beasley if you create jobs here will give you a text

221
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,375
And if you are a company in

222
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,983
Missouri there is a really easy way for you to create a bunch of jobs

223
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,543
In Kansas and get those amazing tax rate

224
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
You just move

225
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,383
Right across the border move across State Line Road

226
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
You don't have to hire a single new person

227
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,503
Your workers just changed their commute a little bit

228
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,319
And now you qualify for this huge tax free

229
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:33,695
The new company crosses State Line Road the politicians could say hey we created a bunch of new jobs

230
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,511
Won't you say creating jobs but it's kind of like

231
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
Stealing jobs

232
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:44,447
No because if it's a new job to the state of Kansas it's a new job in the state of Kansas whether it's from Missy

233
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Mississippi or Missouri

234
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,287
And because it's it's not our state

235
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
Do you're creating jobs

236
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
In the state of Kansas that were like

237
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
Stolen from across the sea

238
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:00,575
Every time that somebody comes from say Missouri to Kansas that is a new Revenue stream that we create

239
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,159
The payroll taxes in capital investment and all the things that go along with that

240
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:09,791
That we didn't have before it's easier to come back from outer space and table that doesn't make any sense but the reality is

241
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
It does

242
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
There are blank

243
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
In every state

244
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
This is not just Kansas

245
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
According to one study

246
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,727
States all over the country are spending

247
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,519
70 billion dollars a year

248
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
Where to create

249
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
Flash steal jobs from each other

250
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,175
And all the kansas-missouri Border this is heated up so much

251
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,711
Kind of cotton

252
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Out of control

253
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,039
Yeah let's list some of the companies that are hopping back in

254
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Okay

255
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,415
JPMorgan retirement moved across the border from Missouri

256
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Kansas

257
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
Free quote a shipping company Kansas to Missouri

258
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
Lake Lofts at 1

259
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
AMC the big movie chain moved from Missouri to

260
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
Kansas another win for

261
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,959
Kansas North American Savings Bank

262
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
Kansas to Missouri at the Los Robles

263
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,847
We even found one company that moved from Missouri to Kansas

264
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
And then back

265
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
To Missouri

266
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
Is an accounting and insurance firm

267
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Cold sea bass

268
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,783
Right so we went by to talk to them and we met Jeff Carlstadt

269
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
The senior managing director

270
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,391
We met in the conference room on the 11th floor of the building

271
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Beautiful view

272
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
From that conference room he can see his old office

273
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
From the window well it's not actually his old office it's his

274
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
Old old office

275
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,423
From when they used to be in Missouri before they move to Kansas and then

276
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
Came back to

277
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
Where we were

278
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Right

279
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,079
Do that Skelly sign parking garage

280
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,151
Like and I can see my very first window that I had from

281
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
We asked him about the movie

282
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,271
And he said there are a lot of factors

283
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,111
He did admit that tax breaks and incentives played a role

284
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:42,719
He wouldn't tell us how much misery gave the company but according to what we read in the local papers

285
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
Is about 26 million dollars and incense

286
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,119
That was in 2014 and cbiz now has a 15-year lease

287
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,959
You're always going to be looking in the evaluating what that next step is I'm

288
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,055
Nope or 15 years away from the end of this lease and

289
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
I want to look at inside

290
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,431
What's the next what's even the next move would you go over the state line again

291
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,735
We would evaluate whatever makes the most sense

292
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
Time for unemployed eyesight

293
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,087
You can say that you would never say no to anything

294
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Never say no

295
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,255
It's kind of like you sending a coded message over to Blake Shrek like Kansas make me an offer

296
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
Yeah for a company this makes sense

297
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
It's the smart thing to do

298
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,911
But you can see where all of this ends up right

299
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,727
The states want to keep these companies so they're slashing tax

300
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,543
And they're digging themselves deeper into a hole

301
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,639
That tax revenue was going to pay for stuff like roads and schools and police

302
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,479
In fact just a couple months after Kansas spent 50 million dollars

303
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,551
Snatching AMC Theaters from across the street in Missouri

304
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,879
Kansas credit education budget by 104 million dollars

305
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,951
And once you Laura company over

306
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,999
There's no guarantee it's going to stay

307
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,327
We met Dave Francais a lawyer in Kansas City

308
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,399
Is your job to leverage Kansas Missouri against

309
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,471
That's part of you

310
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,871
And one day day was talking to a friend of his another lawyer one who happens to work for a certain company that's

311
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
Let's just say

312
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Makes a mean quesadilla

313
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:12,063
A man I knew for a long time A friend of mine was in-house lawyer at Applebee's

314
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,903
And we ran into each other and he mentioned to me that

315
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
They were looking

316
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
At relocating their corporate headquarters

317
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Applebee's

318
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
Which Kansas had fought so hard to keep

319
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
A few years before

320
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
Was thinking about

321
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Moving

322
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,471
It was under new ownership the company was downsizing

323
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
And the big new office building

324
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Was too big

325
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,871
Applebee's hires de France saved and Dave starts

326
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Doing his thing

327
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
We reached out to both state

328
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,087
And we said we are representing Applebee's here's the number of jobs here's the

329
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
Average wages here's the

330
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,439
The capital investment they're planning to make

331
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
And we asked each state

332
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
You know what they would propose Warrior on the Kansas side Blake is running around trying to find Apple

333
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Smaller building

334
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
Missouri is scrambling to get its own inside

335
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Centos package

336
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
Both States put their best

337
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
Offer on the table

338
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
Applebee's Ways to Die

339
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
Time goes by

340
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,199
Andy call Dave

341
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
With their decision

342
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
He was on his way to a Boy Scout camp

343
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
Where he volunteer

344
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,879
I remember I was driving down

345
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
And

346
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439

The last thing

356
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:41,407

00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
Called Missouri and said hey

361
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951

00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
And this was just

366
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:05,471
6 years after Blake Shrek Arkansas border Warrior

367
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,031
Steve Applebee's millions of dollars in tax break

368
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
To stay in Kansas

369
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:15,199
Saudi fransi the lawyer negotiated this deal he's negotiated a lot of them actually

370
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,527
And he may be the dealmaker but even he acknowledges

371
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
This

372
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
Is madness

373
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,647
When I start talking to clients that are in the area

374
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:30,047
The first thing I say to him is you know before we talk about what the incentives are I need to tell you

375
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,911
That what we can talk about is probably the worst public policy in the history of the world

376
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
It's

377
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
Terrible

378
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,359
Thought process by both states of Missouri and Kansas it is also part of how Dave makes his living so

379
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,407
So it's not like he tells companies don't do it

380
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,687
It is lawful

381
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,503
It is encouraged by both States

382
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,039
And

383
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,927
There is an opportunity that you as a business have to consider whether you want to do that

384
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,535
With these help Applebee's negotiated it's moved to Missouri in 2011

385
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,327
We went to see their new offices

386
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,887
They are right on Stateline Road like a

387
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
Few feet inside of the Missouri border

388
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
Let's just go see

389
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,847
Okay going in the lobby

390
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
Hi good morning how are you

391
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
It's at the Applebee's building

392
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,087
That's shorna Andrews she's the receptionist here

393
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
It feels so good

394
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Quiet in here

395
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
It's very quiet

396
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
It's quiet

397
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
For a reason

398
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
We ran into Dion Crooks

399
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559
In the lobby is a facilities manager at Applebee's

400
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,863
And one day last fall he came to work

401
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,703
He's actually pretty excited that day because they were having a big all staff party

402
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
For the upcoming football

403
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
We had a

404
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Had beers

405
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
You know hotdogs

406
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Everything setup

407
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
Then

408
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
About

409
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
An hour later

410
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
I got a email

411
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,087
To say that we have to do a room setup for 300 people

412
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,903
This was not a part of the party plan

413
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
This was an all-staff meeting

414
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,487
Well fast for another hour

415
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Email

416
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Tell a party cancel

417
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
Saudi on setup

418
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Conference room

419
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
All the employees

420
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
Please come in we got up

421
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
Stairs walk in the door

422
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,007
Our CEO is he the first person we saw we want

423
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,335
Only thing we see her we saw every department head from every

424
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,175
Apartment the CEO starts talkin and Dionne can tell it

425
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
It's something big

426
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
She starts out with good news

427
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
She says

428
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
We've had a great year the company's doing well

429
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
Which makes him

430
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Suspicious

431
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,159
Isis cell cars for several years

432
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
I know how it is to

433
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,047
When the car says we like to put people up at the top

434
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
And get them happy

435
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
Evan drop a bomb on me

436
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
And then

437
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Came the bomb

438
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,215
Applebee's was moving again

439
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
And not across the border

440
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
California

441
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,895
And most of the people in that room would be losing their job

442
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,711
It was kind of a

443
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
Big sigh

444
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
The entire room

445
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
What it sound like

446
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,927
And then the next thing everybody's head went straight down to your phone

447
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
I'm in

448
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,023
I personally got up and walked out

449
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,839
I didn't hear the rest of the wish you were saying

450
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,191
Came back downstairs when's opposite I just got sat there for a while

451
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,543
Since that meeting which happened last year Dion says people have

452
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
I've been trickling out

453
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
The office

454
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
Has gotten quieter and

455
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,991
Beyonce's the last Christmas party which happened just a couple of months after

456
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
After the meeting

457
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,551
Was truly awful

458
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
Mattress patch

459
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
What's the Christmas before last

460
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
The soul

461
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,463
Define energetic

462
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
Oh man it was great

463
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
In this past Christmas it was just kind of like

464
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
This is my last Christmas party

465
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
You know

466
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
I won't be here next year

467
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,775
Beyonce's P understands why Applebee's made this move

468
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:56,127
It's parent company is headquartered in California so it made sense to consolidate

469
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,199
So after years of fighting over Applebee's

470
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247
Kansas and Missouri both lost

471
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,087
I want to hear politicians talk about creating jobs

472
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,135
Sometimes those are new jobs

473
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,183
But a lot of times it looks like this

474
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,255
Yeah there's been a job created in California

475
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,839
But somewhere else there's a guy like Deon trying to smile through a Christmas party

476
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,191
So here's one tally of where things stand along the kansas-missouri

477
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,519
From 2010 to 2015

478
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
5702

479
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
Two jobs

480
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,615
Moved from Missouri

481
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,199
You can look at that and say it sounds pretty good for Kansas

482
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,551
But you know how many jobs went the other way from Kansas to Missouri almost as many

483
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,599
3990

484
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:42,207
In the end it's one of those Wars where neither side has really one

485
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
But everyone

486
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,767
I spent a lot of money fighting

487
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,559
The dueling tax breaks

488
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
Cost the government

489
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
Half a billion dollar

490
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:56,031
These numbers by the way it come from the hall Family Foundation which is a local philanthropic group and it looked at a bunch of counties right around

491
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:02,431
So maybe not surprisingly Missouri and Kansas have both been talking about a truce

492
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,735
Missouri wrote what amounts to a

493
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,039
Treaty and along the lines of Kansas

494
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,343
If you don't steal our jobs we won't steal your

495
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
Kansas ignored it

496
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,951
And then just a few weeks ago Kansas wrote its own version of a

497
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
Retreat which is slightly different from Missouri

498
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,863
Missouri responded saying Kansas we will not sign your treaty

499
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
You should sign ours

500
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
It is a

501
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Truce War

502
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,263
This is what Kansas and Missouri are fighting over now

503
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
How to make

504
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,967
Alright so we did that story back in the spring of 2016 did Kansas and Missouri end up calling a truce if they'd

505
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
Did whose truth did they called

506
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
That's coming up after the break

507
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,879
Support for this podcast and the following message

Bucks County Eda. Org

514
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:05,151
When we left off in 2016 Kansas and Missouri were talking about a truce about a way to avoid these bidding wars

515
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,807
So I did a quick Google search today to find out if they struck a deal and I found the story in the Kansas Star from

516
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
Be weary of this year

517
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,744
Kansas the state of Kansas offered 3 million dollars in tax breaks to a company called HCA mid

518
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
Midwest Health

519
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
If that company would move

520
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,120
4 miles across the border into Kansas

521
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,704
And the company took the deal so no troops as far as we can tell

522
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:38,432
We would love to hear what you think of the show you can send us an email to Planet Money NPR. Org and we're on Facebook and Instagram
