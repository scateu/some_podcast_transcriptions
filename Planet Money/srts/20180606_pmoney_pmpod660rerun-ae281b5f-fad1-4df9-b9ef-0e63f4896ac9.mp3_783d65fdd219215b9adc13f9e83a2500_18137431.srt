00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:03,840
Randy Reese owns a cattle ranch in northeastern Montana

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,376
He runs it with the sunshine

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,656
Where are we

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,192
Ranch

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,472
Middle of nowhere

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,544
The Reese Ranch borders the Badlands

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,616
These big bear whitehills stick up out of

8
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,408
Sagebrush and dry grass

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
It is really remote

10
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,040
The only way to get to Randy's house is on this very bumpy dirt road

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:28,416
So when he was pretty surprised a couple years ago when you saw it to strangers

12
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,952
Driving down that road

13
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,720
To see him

14
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,512
Actually guy showed up with a fruit

15
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,584
Did a fruit basket

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
And what did he say

17
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,960
Asked if we could go out and look around for

18
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,496
Fossils I guess

19
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,800
Look around for fossils

20
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:49,920
The men told Randy they thought his Ranch might have dinosaur bones buried on it

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,224
They offered him $5,000

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
Look around for

23
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
Couple years

24
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,528
Ants

25
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,808
If they found something good

26
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,856
The reasons would get a 10% cut

27
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,624
The profit

28
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
Brandi said

29
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,440
Go for it

30
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,560
They set off to a far corner of the ranch and Randy didn't see much of them for a long time

31
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,144
But then about a year later they showed back up

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
His house

33
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,448
They found something

34
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Teeth

35
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,752
And part of a tail

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
And they thought

37
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,336
It was not just any dinosaur

38
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,640
Came back this year and they phoned up

39
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
T-Rex

40
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
That was kinda exciting

41
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
T-Rex

42
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
The Reese's are understated

43
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,696
But there was a T-Rex in their backyard

44
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
And this is a really big

45
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Deal from them

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,304
Randy and his wife had Reese Rex

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
T-shirts made up for all their grandkids

48
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,680
I'm ready Sunshine Reese learned all of these scientific facts

49
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
About their dinosaur

50
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
What's the most

51
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
Complete T-rex skull

52
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Never found

53
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
They found new

54
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,360
Orbital

55
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
Eye socket like bones

56
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
And maybe like

57
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,992
Mentally said like horns

58
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
They're getting super into it

59
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
And there is a good reason for that

60
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
This T-Rex

61
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Could mean a lot of money

62
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
For the Reese's

63
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
In the US

64
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,488
If you find a T-Rex

65
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,792
Or any fossil in your backyard

66
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
You own it

67
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
It's yours

68
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,168
You don't have to hand it over to the government or Museum

69
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,472
You can sell it to the highest bidder

70
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
As a result

71
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568
There is a dinosaur Gold Rush going on

72
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,432
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

73
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,712
And I'm quatrain bully

74
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
Today in the show

75
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136
What happens when you try to put a price on the bones of a humongous 66 million-year-old monster

76
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:41,024
We can actually pinpoint the exact moment when fossils went from scientific artifact

77
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
The cash crop

78
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,096
It was 20 years ago

79
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
And it was the biggest

80
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,192
Baddest dinosaur that has ever been found

81
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
It was a T-Rex

82
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
Of course

83
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
A T-Rex

84
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
Named Sue

85
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,128

94
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
Curious how the dinosaur world

95
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
Used to work

96
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,496
A team of scientists would come up to a Rancher

97
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
Ask if they can look around for bones

98
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
If they found something

99
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
They come out

100
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
Excavated pickaxes

101
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
Dental tools paint brushes

102
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
It was a painstaking process

103
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
They could take a year

104
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,040
The bones would end up in a museum

105
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,856
And the Rancher make it a little credit on a plaque

106
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
It was a handshake.

107
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
No cash

108
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
That'll change because of

109
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
Pete Larson

110
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
Peated study paleontology in college

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
And he thought I could make a business

112
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
Out of dinosaurs

113
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
He started paying Ranchers

114
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
To dig up Bones on their land

115
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,496
Then he would sell what he found

116
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,824
And what day you was on a dig in the Badlands of South Dakota

117
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,896
What are the members of his team is woman named Sue Hendrickson

118
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
She went out a walk with her dog

119
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,992
And you keep running back to him with something in her hand

120
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,344
She holds out her hand with these two pieces of bone with this honeycomb pattern

121
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
And if there's more there and she said there's a lot more there and so we ran literally ran to the side about 2 miles away

122
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
And here were these

123
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,631
Basically pieces of bones just dripping out of the side of this cliff

124
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
What did you do

125
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
We dug it up

126
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
It was like the most wonderful

127
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
Wonderful time

128
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,895
Of my life digging that fossil

129
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
It was a Tyrannosaurus Rex

130
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,223
And not just a piece of one

131
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
Skull was there full of teeth

132
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
The whole spine entail

133
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
The huge leg bones

134
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
One of the little arms

135
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,207
It was the most complete T-Rex ever found

136
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
P&A mitsu

137
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
After the woman who discovered it

138
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,863
Sue's bones had all of these amazing details that have been preserved

139
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,911
Broken rib that healed

140
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,959
Giant holes in her lower jaw

141
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
He thinks we're from the teeth of another T-Rex

142
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
She has

143
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
Some crushed bones at the top of your skull

144
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
The left side of the lower Jaws

145
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
Pulled out of

146
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,807
Play stupid could have by thing actually caused her death where she had basically the left side of her face was ripped off by another team

147
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,599
A rough life

148
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
Pete and his team spent

149
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
3 weeks digging her out

150
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
The carries her bones back to his shop

151
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
And started

152
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
Oculus Lee cleaning and preparing them

153
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Pete's plan

154
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
Was not to sell her

155
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
He wanted to use her to start a museum

156
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,215
It is little town of Hill City South Dakota

157
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,287
If you want to make a place where everyone could see her

158
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
We're scientists could come in

159
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
Study her whole town was in

160
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,455
School kids even held bake sales to raise money for this Museum

161
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
Anu spredfast

162
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,575
Scientist School in from all over the world to get a look at SU

163
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,391
Reporters came and then one day we get up

164
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:53,791
There was a knock on my door I was showering at 7:30 in the morning and getting ready to come to work and I lived in a tree

165
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
Trailer house behind the Institute

166
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,727
I walked out and there's 35 FBI agents and National Guard and all kinds of people here that just

167
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:08,383
Yeah just unreal situation and they were saying that we had somehow spirited this dinosaur away in The Odyssey

168
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Search warrant to surrender

169
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Her bones

170
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
Suicide landed in the middle of an epic

171
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Legal battle

172
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
It was clear that she was special

173
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,135
And unlike the bones Peter dug up in the past

174
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,183
Sue might be worth a lot of money

175
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,255
There was a question now about who owns

176
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,327
Puget Sound Sue on the land of a Rancher

177
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
He paid the rent for $5,000

178
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,423
There was no written contract

179
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,751
The renter said that money was for just digging up the land

180
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:39,359
He said he owns zoo and wild is Big custody battle is being sorted out

181
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,663
Sue's bones were seized by the FBI

182
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
And how old is evidence

183
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
They put Sue in

184
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,087
In a sea Freight container basically in the Boiler Room at the School of Mines

185
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,903
Sue sat in the basement at the University

186
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
He would go and talk to her at night

187
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
Actually looking in the window at the container

188
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,303
And what would you say

189
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,887
I'm just babe but basically I'm going to get you the hell out of there

190
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,543
It's just that was sad and lock up this wonderful animal

191
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
Just wrong

192
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199
The court decided in favor of the Rancher

193
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
Pete was crushed

194
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,783
Now the Rancher got to side with

195
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Annie's choice

196
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Put her up for auction

197
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,671
It was a sale like nobody had ever seen

198
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,487
Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Sotheby's

199
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,583
We have for auction today the fossil of a Tyrannosaurus Rex

200
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
No Natsu

201
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423
To some people this was a crazy MoMA

202
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
Auctioning off a dinosaur

203
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,263
That was something you didn't do

204
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,823
No one had any idea what to do with self

205
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,919
Lance grandi is a paleontologist with the Chicago Field Museum

206
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
They were one of the bidders

207
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,551
There all kinds of people trying to get ahold of Sue

208
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
We bet against

209
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
Are there museums

210
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,695
Gambling casinos real estate companies in

211
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:04,351
Even in one private individual who wanted it for an ornament in his living room

212
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:10,751
70 + $500,000 + $560,000 + $700,000

213
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,335
Tony and dropped out after 7.2 million

214
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:18,431
The North Carolina Museum of Natural History dropped out and now they were just

215
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
Two bidders left

216
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
Chicago Field Museum

217
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,295
And a real estate Baron from Florida

218
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,879
Keep put up a 7.3 million dollar bid

219
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,951
We kind of with a 7.4 million dollar bid

220
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,511
He bumped his 27.5

221
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,911
Seven five

222
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
And it looks like Sue

223
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
She was headed to Florida

224
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,567
But the Chicago Field Museum had a professional bitter working with them

225
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,383
And he told them he thought the real estate Baron

226
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
Might be tapped out

227
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
He said

228
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
Make one more big

229
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Just one more

230
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,343
7600000

231
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
So are we bit

232
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,951
7.6 million and that was the bed that took it

233
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,303
Was Sotheby's 10% commission added the total price tag came to

234
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,655
8362000 $500

235
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,751
Sue went to the field museum for 8.3 million dollars

236
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,311
She still there today and that moment

237
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
When the gavel fell

238
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
That moment changed

239
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Paleontology

240
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Forever

241
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,015
Now everyone knew that dinosaur fossils were not just scientific relics

242
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
They had a price tag

243
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
And a pretty big one

244
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,999
And it didn't hurt that all of this happened around the time of a particular movie you might remember

245
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:41,631
Jurassic Park

246
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,447
Natural History Museum

247
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
And lots of

248
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,775
If people wanted to buy dinosaurs

249
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
Prices were quickly

250
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
Duckbill dinosaurs

251
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
Not worth a whole lot they're kind of everywhere

252
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,735
Like the cows of the dinosaur world

253
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
Triceratops

254
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Honey in the middle

255
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,343
A good one can set you up to a million dollars

256
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
The by far

257
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
The most profitable dinosaur

258
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
The king of the market

259
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
The Tyrannosaurus Rex

260
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,047
You can imagine what happens next

261
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,143
Thousands of fossil Hunters started crawling all over the hills

262
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,983
South Dakota Wyoming Montana hoping to strike it rich

263
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,055
It's the only part of the world were T-Rexes are found

264
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
And paleontologist

265
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,919
People who dedicated their entire lives to scientific

266
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Discovery

267
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
They were not very happy about

268
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,831
Jack Horner is a paleontologist at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman Montana

269
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
And

270
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,671
He's partially responsible for this whole dinosaur crazy

271
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,999
Is the technical advisor for the Jurassic Park movie

272
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,815
And one of the main characters is actually based on him

273
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
You're the cute one

274
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
Sam Neill character

275
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
I'm just glad he didn't get eaten

276
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
Jack was not excited

277
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
See all of these newcomers on his turf

278
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
Because a lot of these guys aren't scientist

279
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,127
If no qualification

280
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,687
Eminem just answered an ad on Craigslist

281
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,039
Angie says a lot of valuable information is getting lost

282
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,367
When we're looking for scientific information

283
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,951
You're the rock around it and how the thing is laying an

284
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,351
Exactly where it is geologically and geographically that's all important information

285
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,935
But it's basically overhead for commercial collector

286
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,263
Jack says doing a dinosaur dig right

287
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Requires skill

288
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
Equipment

289
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
Precision

290
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,151
Like right now he is trying to find

291
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
Dinosaur DNA

292
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Just like in dress

293
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
And he says he's close

294
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,855
All he needs now is to find the right

295
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Bone

296
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Wear white gloves we

297
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,975
Do extractions into

298
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
12 get it to a lab

299
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
As quickly as possible

300
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:53,471
We actually built a clean lap in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer so we could actually get our laboratory to the fee

301
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,055
Could something like that be lost in a commercial.

302
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Yes

303
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
It could be us

304
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
Jack says all kinds of information

305
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Is getting lost

306
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
Because most commercial diggers

307
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
All about

308
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Getting

309
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,039
Get bones get out

310
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,391
When do Reese's Sons CB & Shane

311
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
Take me out to see the commercial dig site

312
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,023
Were there T-Rex so I have never been to a fossil

313
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
I've no idea what

314
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
What's it look like

315
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
But I have to say

316
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
This one was kind of a mess

317
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
It's like a construction site

318
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:31,615
Is yeah they had a huge bulldozer a d8 or D9 out here to do all this

319
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:37,247
The diggers left the site a month ago but she Nancy B say they can show me the spot where the dinosaur

320
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Used to be

321
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
But when we get there there's

322
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
I have a surprise waiting for us

323
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
Well that looks like they're still bones out here

324
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,719
Oh my God there's still a plaster left

325
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Wow

326
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:54,399
I better not be the skull bone out of the ground they put it right into a plaster cast

327
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,727
The plaster cast protects it when they're moving it from the dig site

328
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
To the lab

329
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
And there is a

330
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
Used plaster cast

331
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
It is still a

332
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
Despite just sitting on some boards

333
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
In the dirt

334
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,455
And from the size of the plaster cast

335
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
Shane Reese

336
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,015
Thinks this is the skull

337
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,039
The Tyrannosaurus Rex

338
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
He's really upset

339
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
You should have gotten it out by now

340
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,695
Cuz pretty soon they're not going to be able to get it out once winter hits

341
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
This is going to be stuck here

342
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,511
The Canadian dollar sitting right there

343
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
The digging company wouldn't talk to us

344
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
But they did send us an email

345
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
They said yes

346
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
That is the skull

347
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
But the reason that is still there is that they're trying to be

348
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,615
Be careful it's at the school waste so much they have to bring in the special equipment so that they can take it out without damaging it

349
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
After that they'll spend a year or two preparing it

350
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
And then they'll sell it

351
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
After doing some research and talking to the company

352
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
The Reese's think they're T-Rex

353
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,415
We'll probably go for between one and $2000000

354
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,743
That would mean a couple hundred thousand dollars for the Reese's

355
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,303
You guys have a preference for where it ends up

356
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,607
It really does belong Museum and not

357
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,167
In a private collection where only one person gets

358
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
It may end up in a private collection

359
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
If they pay more I'm okay with

360
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,103
Right

361
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,431
The cool skull with all of the bones and horns

362
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
Scientist

363
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
Might never even be able to

364
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,575
T-Rexes might have horns and no one will know

365
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,159
Except a real estate billionaire who will hang Christmas ornaments on them

366
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
We asked Lance Grande about this

367
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,767
Paleontologist from the Chicago Field Museum

368
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,095
All of this information potentially getting lost

369
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,167
And paleontologists getting priced out of the fossil Market

370
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
Oh that's a really tough question

371
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,519
I mean there is a downside

372
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
Lamp says some science

373
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
Is being lost

374
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,943
And a lot of ranchers won't let museums or scientists dig on their land anymore

375
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,503
They want the money the private companies can offer

376
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
But

377
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Myself

378
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,879
For me and my locality the net is positive because

379
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,719
They're just a lot more fossils being excavated then

380
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,535
Have ever been excavated in the past

381
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
Before suit

382
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,631
T-Rexes were being found once every 10 years or so

383
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Sensu

384
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
T-Rexes are being found

385
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
Once every 6 months

386
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,311
20 times more fossils coming out of the ground

387
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
Because there is a market for

388
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,175
And if the fossil smart pulled out of the ground

389
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
They would most likely a road away

390
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
And this is actually kind of important because

391
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
There's actually clock that's ticking

392
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
Fossils will start to pick out of the ground

393
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,743
Evan there's this little window of time for someone to see it and get it out before it crumbles to dust

394
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,863
Phoebe and Jane Reese tell me they see fossils all over their Ranch all the time

395
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,679
Take me to one place where they used to campus kids

396
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
Actually adorably called Dino Hill

397
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,055
Is he just a big rib sticking out of a dirt Mound that they use

398
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
Used to put their sleeping bags on

399
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,407
When we get there the rib is gone

400
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Scrambled

401
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
But this is something else

402
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Oh my God right here

403
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
Oh yeah look at that

404
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,623
Wow

405
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,415
Yeah yeah

406
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
Yeah wow that's

407
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
Welcome to Reese Ranch

408
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
If you wanted

409
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Do you wanted a souvenir you

410
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
Did you actually take one

411
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
No I didn't

412
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Fossils

413
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,983
Still seem kind of sacred

414
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
I couldn't even touch it

415
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Actually none of us

416
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
We all just stood around

417
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Looking at it

418
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
Super excited

419
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,455
Find imagine this animal running around these Hills

420
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
6 million years

421
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
We're like little kids

422
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Probably

423
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,111
Pig skeleton under me

424
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
But we'll probably never know

425
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,463
This part of the Reese Ranch isn't getting X

426
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
Excavated

427
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
It's on government land

428
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
Reese's just lease it

429
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,839
And different rules apply here

430
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
No for-profit

431
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,447
So the shoulder blade will stay in the ground

432
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,751
Until University or Museum comes to

433
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
Did you get up

434
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Or it might just a road away

435
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,151
Actually the same fate could have happened to the Reese's

436
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
T-Rex

437
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,223
It was right up against their property line

438
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
Just 40 feet away from government

439
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:01,439
2 T-Rex steps exactly if a T-Rex it taken two more steps before died

440
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
The Reese's

441
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
Wouldn't have gotten a dime

442
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
And the T-Rex

443
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
Might not have been found at all

444
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,887

Pete Larson the guy who found Sue

455
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:48,031
Did eventually build his Museum in Hill City South Dakota he lost to

456
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:54,431
But he did go on to find a few other T-Rexes we've collected 10 T-Rexes now

457
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:59,807
To Stand Stephen Duffy Bucky wirex

458
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:04,159
Oo7 a lyrics how many been found in the world

459
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:09,279
So there's about fifty specimens that really qualifies something that's important

460
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,375
To 20% of all the T-Rexes in the world

461
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
You put your hands on

462
