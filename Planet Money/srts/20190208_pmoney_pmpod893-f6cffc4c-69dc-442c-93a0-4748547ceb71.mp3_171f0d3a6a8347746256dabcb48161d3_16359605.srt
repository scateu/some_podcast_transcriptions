00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,608
Recently Gizmodo reporter Kashmir Hill tried some

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,888
Nearly impossible

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,168
Paternalism

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,728
I wanted to see if it was possible to live

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,264
Without the tech Giants

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,336
So Amazon Facebook Microsoft Apple

7
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
And Google

8
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,384
She tried to cut them all at

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,432
But I mostly wanted to talk

10
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,712
The cashmere about going off

11
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,016
Cuz Google is everywhere

12
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:27,648
And she was like yeah if you're going to cut them out you got to do way more than just switching search engines and email

13
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,208
She actually asked a programmer

14
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
To make like

15
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,280
A gate that wouldn't let anything Google into

16
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,072
So it meant that leg

17
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
Google

18
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,376
Analytics

19
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:42,752
Didn't load and Google's trackers didn't load in Google fonts which is apparently used all over the web

20
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,544
Didn't load in Google Maps

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,568
Didn't load which

22
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,944
Shutdown having services

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,016
It was a huge problem

24
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,552
Kazimierz article was kind of mine

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
Because sure we all know we used

26
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,392
What I didn't know

27
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,672
Just how much

28
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,488
Of the internet uses Google's infrastructure to do

29
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,512
Just about everything

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,328
Example one day she was trying to go and drop off

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
The sheriff

32
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,936
So she enters your username or password and nothing was happening

33
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,984
And it turns out that

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,592
Dropbox uses a service from Google it to determine whether or not your

35
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
A bot

36
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,664
And so because I was blocking Google

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,784
It looked at Dropbox like I wasn't human and they wouldn't let me sign in because Kashmir was blocked from

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,112
Fonts and trackers in maps and a million other Google things

39
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
Her internet

40
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
With basically

41
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,952
You're saying that it's like

42
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
Is everywhere

43
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Yeah it's

44
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,560
It's every

45
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,912
Basically blocking Google made me feel like I

46
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
Was

47
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,776
Back on dial-up internet in the 90s

48
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
And this was just the Google part

49
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Remember

50
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
Kashmir did this for all of the

51
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
Amazon

52
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,320
Facebook Google Microsoft and Apple in that order in and then the last week I blocked all 5 at once

53
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,880
Kashmir's article was so good that

54
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,672
After I read it I was just like

55
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,464
Why didn't I see

56
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512
Can I just say

57
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
Here at Planet Money

58
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,352
Sentence around everyone's looked at it

59
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
And we are also

60
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
So jealous of

61
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,824
You wouldn't be jealous if you had to live through a Heroes I must be a masochist

62
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,152
Well thank you for doing it so we didn't have to

63
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,224
Thanks for sending me a valentine

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272
Hello X

65
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,136
Every year usually around Valentine's Day we Channel our feelings of jealousy

66
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
And turn them into

67
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
Appreciation

68
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232

Travel show in Shadow

70
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
To a movie that inspires

71
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Existential dread

72
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,936
An obscure central-bank bureaucrat

73
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,776
And a brutal sport that explains a lot about economics

00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
My Valentines full of the bank of Jamaica

95
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,488
And I'm going to say what it is I'm just going to show you

96
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
So what I'm saying is a music

97
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
Video

98
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,752
About the Jamaican economy featuring like

99
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
A souped-up race car and exchange rates

100
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:07,808
Driving to the central bank and in the background with the oldest reggae music explaining what the central bank doing about in

101
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
What is the backstory

102
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
The backstory goes

103
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,536
To the sky Toni Morrison he's ahead of

104
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Communications

105
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
Jamaican Center

106
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,143
Last year he was sitting in the back of Jamaica

107
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
There are these Big E,

108
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
Your phone's going on

109
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,263
Antonio has an idea to explain how the bank is

110
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
Is managing pricing

111
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,127
Central banks have a lot of tools to do this mostly boring speech

112
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Beaches in my

113
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
Experience that's the primary tools but turning

114
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
He's got this other ID

115
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Music

116
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
Thinking of using music

117
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
Attitude

118
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,903
GameStop might not really what I love about this is

119
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
Planet Money we have

120
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
I have tried so many ways to

121
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
Explain

122
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Inflation targeting

123
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
And the psychology behind it

124
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,143
But these guys but Tony at the Central Bank of Jamaica

125
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,191
Had just like figured out a way to

126
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
Get it stuck in my head

127
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
They are smashing a

128
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,847
There's a serious purpose behind using music to explain inflation

129
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,943
Jamaica struggled with really high price inflation basically since

130
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
The 60s

131
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,527
At some point in the 1990s was over 70%

132
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Like

133
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
Super high price and place

134
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Up and up and up

135
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,743
Trevor the last few years Jamaica has succeeded in driving the inflation rate down

136
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,351
What Tony told me is that he wants to convince the people of Jamaica that this is going to stick

137
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,167
Because inflation is psychology

138
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:31,263
Jacole in a way right so Tony knows that inflation is fueled by the

139
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
Eat a vicious to virtuous cycle

140
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
People think prices going to rise a lot

141
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,687
They'll spend the money faster for the speeding up inflation

142
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,479
If I think inflation Will Be Loved

143
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
That in itself

144
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
Will help slow inflation

145
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
Economist call this

146
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,391
Anchoring inflation expectations

147
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
And so

148
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
Tony

149
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,487
Has figured out a way to

150
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Explain to

151
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
Anyone and everyone

152
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,351
The inflation will stay low just trust

153
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,423
Exactly so these videos are actually pretty important

154
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
I love this

155
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
So much

156
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
Thank you Darren Woods

157
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
Sabrina Terrace

158
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
It's been a complete pleasure to set my data watching reggae videos about it

159
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:16,319
Baseline and reggae music

160
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,719
A message from

161
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Bank of Jamaica

162
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
Okay next up Noel King what he got for

163
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,655
This year I was wildly jealous of a documentary that appeared on neck

164
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
It's called

165
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,495
Fire the greatest party that never happened you saw it

166
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,335
Two under suggestion Music Festival that happened in 2007

167
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
Which was arguably the most

168
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
Brilliantly height

169
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
Music festival in

170
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,783
It started with a video on Insta

171
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,047
Yes like this slickly produced

172
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Video

173
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
Drone footage of this

174
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,519
Private Island they said Pablo Escobar's Island

175
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,919
It's in there playing in the water with pigs which is weird but it's cool

176
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
Looks like an Instagram

177
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
Influencers

178
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
Island dream

179
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,647
So people pay thousands in some cases even tens of thousands of dollars to get to

180
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
To the festival

181
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
MN

182
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
They get off the plane in the Bahamas

183
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
And the beach is

184
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
The parking lot

185
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
And luxury accommodations are damped

186
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
There are no models anywhere

187
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:41,055
And there's nothing to eat except cheese sandwiches

188
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:47,455
There was a belief on the bus a lot of people thought that now you know maybe we're passing through this are

189
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,855
Are you normal isn't just on the other side was like oh my God

190
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,815
Yeah I remember watching this in real time on Twitter

191
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
And just kind of laugh

192
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
Because basically

193
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
But then we all just sort of file this away in the

194
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,287
The cabinet full of millennial failures and moved on with our lives

195
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Until

196
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
This

197
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,407
Because it had something kind of special right

198
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
It really did

199
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,503
Safari Festival is now a huge legal fee asked

200
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
One of the co-founders is in prison

201
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,903
Anderson journalist I could not believe the access they got

202
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,463
They had all of this Insider footage

203
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
Did the two co-founders

204
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,095
Copping to the fact that they were selling something that they knew was not real

205
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,567
I see the documentary and I get curious and I start reading about a

206
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
How to figure out how they pulled this off

207
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,687
And it turns out the reason they had all of his damning footage

208
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,015
Was because the people who'd been in charge of

209
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,063
Promoting the fyre festival

210
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
Were some of the same people who produced the document

211
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:05,535
This documentary is ethically compromised so why are you recommending it to her listeners because it's so dead

212
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
On about

213
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,399
What it is to live in the age of Instagram like these incompetent

214
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Hucksters

215
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,263
Can inspire people across the world to be so afraid of missing out

216
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,151
Did even though the organizers don't have enough money or any preparation or any idea how to deliver

217
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
Thousands of people fall for it

218
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,735
Because influencers tell them

219
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,087
The documentary is fyre the greatest party that never happened

220
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
And Italy

221
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:37,279
XML

222
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
What's the Valentine's

223
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
We got

224
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
I sort of

225
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,727
Understood what does next one which comes from Cardiff Garcia

226
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,287
The co-hosts of the indicator from Planet Money

227
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Hello Cardiff

228
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,359
And I do not understand this at all

229
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Go for it

230
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,943
So my Valentine is 2 mixed martial arts

231
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
The sport of

232
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
And then a snake if you've never seen it

233
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
For here's a little

234
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Clipper

235
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:06,207
Kinetic Lynch's exactly what you got

236
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
Oh

237
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
Yeah that was a

238
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,071
Quite a few quite a blow in with a right hook coming out of

239
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
French garlic

240
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
As we say

241
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
Why do you like this

242
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
I find it kind of endlessly entertaining

243
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
Watch

244
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
I find that there is

245
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
Such a wide range

246
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,687
Employed it actually is a much more kind of intellectual and intriguing

247
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
Sport that a lot of people give it credit for

248
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,295
But the main reason I gave it the Valentine

249
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,111
Is because it is such a controversial business

250
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,671
And because the specific controversy

251
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
Fees of mixed martial arts as a

252
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
Business

253
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,047
Are so emblematic of the controversies

254
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,351
Did exist in the overall US economy

255
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
Okay I was raised in a

256
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,983
Cocoon where I didn't know anything about violence or economic so

257
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
Play this metaphor out for

258
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
Start with this the UFC

259
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
The ultimate fighting

260
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,663
Is the main promotional organization

261
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Of make

262
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
Martial arts the only one I've ever fight yeah exactly

263
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,599
And it's much bigger than all of its rivals in part because it bought so many of those rivals on its way to

264
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
Becoming huge

265
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,999
Because of the URC size Fighters don't have many options for other promotions were they can

266
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
Can fight to the fighters kind of have to accept

267
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
Like a really stringent requirements

268
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
Set the UFC imposes on them

269
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
Including how much it pays them

270
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
What's the fighters might say

271
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
A little

272
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,311
And you've been walking around the office using the

273
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Big words

274
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,895
Describe this relationship between

275
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
Labor

276
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
M capital

277
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
Yes monopsony

278
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Monopsony

279
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
What is

280
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,831
So in the labor market a monopsony is when you have a

281
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:42,719
A company that is either the only company that employs all the workers in a certain industry or more commonly

282
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
It's by far

283
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Biggest in

284
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
So it just has a lot of power

285
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
And a lot of Fighters who said that

286
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
That's the UFC

287
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,471
Alright so bring it back how does one guy knocking out another guy

288
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,007
Relate to the economy rent

289
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,567
Even though I haven't made it obvious yet

290
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,639
So what critics of the UFC say is that

291
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Because

292
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
It is part of a monopoly

293
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,759
I just kind of led to like a hollowed-out middle class

294
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Within the sport

295
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
You still have some of these super Starfighter

296
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,647
Make a ton of money sometimes millions of dollars

297
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,023
Giving fights and obviously the UFC owners get to keep a huge chunk of the money that's made in

298
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
Sport

299
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,351
But then you have all these other Fighters most of the fighters

300
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
In fact who don't make a ton of money

301
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,935
They have to pay for their own benefit

302
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
Can all kinds of other things

303
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
Out of pocket

304
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,799
So you end up with quite a bit of inequalities

305
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,847
Within the sport what the critics are saying

306
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,895
Is it that is a result of the UFC

307
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Monopsonist

308
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
That sounds

309
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
Could also mirror what's happening

310
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,599
Sing in the US economy now right

311
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
Kill Economist are increasingly worried that

312
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,463
Fewer and fewer companies in summoned

313
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,791
Street are controlling more and more of the workers Maybe

314
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
That is responsible for some of the Rising

315
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Inequality that the US

316
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Contumacy

317
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935

You teach me so much about the economy will you teach me how to fight

322
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895

00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,159
I did it's called in my father's

341
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Houses by Fox

And I love this boy

343
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
But I just disappeared

344
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,607
This is a book that was less about economic

345
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,167
But it's about a topic I love reporting on

346
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Criminal

347
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,543
We should say before you in economics reporter you reported on criminal justice

348
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
A half a day

349
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
Get right

350
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,943
Okay and what does book does as it explores this question of how

351
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
Criminal Behavior

352
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
Can spread across

353
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,831
Generations within one single family

354
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,159
You know the question is is it more nature or more nurture

355
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Why that happens

356
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
Fox Butterfield

00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
Character I mean

378
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
This is one scene where

379
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,591
Keep driving by the Oregon State Correctional Institution with his son

380
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
And he's

381
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
Gazing out at the prison with

382
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
The sense of me

383
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
And tell the boys

384
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
Look carefully

385
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
Because when you grow up

386
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
You guys

387
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
I can end up

388
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
And doesn't say it like it's some

389
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
Morning he says it with

390
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
It is it is

391
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Destiny it is

392
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
Bait to end up in prison

393
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
So it sounds like Fox Butterfield

394
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
Falls more on the nurture side

395
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
Well he does just that there's nature involved

396
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,055
2 like for example mental illness was passed down generations and That's genetics

397
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
What

398
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
Butterfield does he builds this

399
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
PS4 how much

400
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Fever is

401
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,711
Learn by example

402
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:54,367
It's the bogles they were this really socially isolated family they didn't hang out with friends and hang out with other families

403
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,719
Tight social unit generation after generation so

404
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,559
One criminal would be modeling behavior for the next command

405
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Down the line

406
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,631
It was literally a kid

407
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
Who committed his first

408
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
Burglary when he was

409
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
4

410
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Years

411
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
Old

412
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
Because that's only saw his

413
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Dad and

414
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Brother's Day

415
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,407
And I know all of it sounds incredibly Grim but

416
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
The book was just so

417
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,503
Compellingly written I was

418
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
I was engrossed

419
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
The entire way through

420
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:29,183
Focus by Fox Butterfield what's it called again in my father's house

421
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,975
