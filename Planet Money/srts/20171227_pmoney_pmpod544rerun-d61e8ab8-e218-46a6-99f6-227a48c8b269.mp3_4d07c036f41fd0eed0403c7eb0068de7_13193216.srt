00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:03,072
Hey ml to Chang we're about to play for UA

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,120
Classic episode of Planet Money

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,400
From 2014

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,984
It's about a very guarded industry full of tradesy

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,544
But the story really started

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,616
When David kestenbaum got a little hungry at work

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,712
The other day I went down to the lobby of our building here to get a snack

8
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,784
And I decided on Eminem's but I could not decide

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
Which kind

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,088
So I bought two packs

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,880
One regular M&M's

12
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,160
One peanut butter-filled

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,584
And in the elevator back up to the office so you know there's like never anything to do in the elevator actually started reading the labels

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
On these package

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,376
And

16
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,168
I found something really strange

17
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,960
Can I have one here

18
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:45,312
A pack of regular M&M's weighs 1.69 Oz

19
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,128
Pack of peanut butter M&M's

20
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,664
Slightly less

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,712
1.63 Oz

22
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,016
Are the same price a dollar each

23
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,088
But you get slightly less of the peanut butter M&M

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
0.06 Oz

25
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,256
Is it tiny different way down at the third decimal place

26
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,048
Discourse drove me crazy

27
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
So I started to look into it

28
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
That was a month ago

29
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:14,496
Turns out there is a whole weird world living down there at the third decimal place

30
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
When you pull in that little thread lots of things start to unravel

31
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
Today I'm going to take you down the Eminem Rabbit Hole I promise we'll never pop piece of candy in your mouth

32
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,904
Think about it the same way again

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,304

00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:03,392
When I get back to my desk I thought you know this is the kind of thing that someone probably has a whole blog post about

41
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,696
And there is nothing

42
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,560
I tried to lookup a company's annual reports Mars is the company that makes M&M's

43
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
But there are no annual

44
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
Sports

45
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,936
Marcella private company owned by the Mars fan

46
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
4 Generations

47
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,264
And they are incredibly secretive

48
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,056
Like a real-life Willy Wonka

49
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
I'm sure

50
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
Did they were

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Hoping

52
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,432
No one like you would ever come along

53
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,992
To notice such a small

54
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Tiny difference

55
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,808
This is Joelle Glenn Brenner

56
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,624
She used to work for the Washington Post and short a book called

57
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
The emperor's of chocolate

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,464
Inside the secret world of Hershey and Mars

59
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,560
She says she's the only journalist the Mars company has ever really let in

60
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,840
So I asked her

61
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,192
Am I crazy does this tiny little weight difference mean something

62
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
Is it just an accident

63
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
She said whatever is going on

64
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
It is no accident

65
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
2 even

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
Have got difference I can promise you with something

67
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,200
That was angst-ridden for the company

68
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
They don't want

69
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
Consumers

70
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
To have a question

71
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
Like that

72
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,672
The Mars family basically never ever gives interview

73
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
But I put in a request

74
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
And I kept digging

75
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,072
Trying to find out why one pack was slightly lighter than the other

76
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,704
I decided to track down a competitor after all who studies Eminem's more closely than a rival company

77
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
And I found a bill Edwards

78
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
Bill used to work for one of Mars's main rival

79
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
A company called Roundtree

80
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,688
Roundtree developed the British candy called Smarties which

81
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
A lot like Eminem

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,784
You should appreciate that

83
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
Victory in the street is incredibly sacred

84
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
How many more secrets of a Skype

85
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
Show me places where they make nuclear weapons

86
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
Celebrity Skype food places

87
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
Bill is a chemist by train

88
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,936
He's been a lot of time trying to reverse-engineer competitors products

89
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,800
He told me that he and his colleagues once did an extensive scientific analysis of Milky Way bar

90
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
To try to figure out why they had a double layer of Chaka

91
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Quit coding

92
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
When you're doing something like that he says

93
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,760
Even little things like the weight of a package can be a clue

94
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,600
In some Industries companies spell out stuff like that in their patent Apple

95
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
But candy companies

96
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
Don't mess with patency says

97
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
Consider for instance the KitKat

98
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
Which is old employer invent

99
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
And I mean to be making kit kat change

100
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,375
Sec 1934

101
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
And

102
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
There's certain things in that process

103
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
Better than Titans

104
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,359
Filming in public in the 1950s

105
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
Do you know how Kit Kats are made

106
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
I do not get some ideas

107
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
You do

108
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,063
Yeah

109
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
Can you tell me

110
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Secret

111
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
If I knew the secret would I think that's so

112
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
So cool

113
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,887
Adele Roundtree company used to have a rule

114
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,959
Santa be at least one difficult stage in each Pro

115
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,543
There are about a dozen difficult

116
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,639
Bill had a theory about the M&M puzzle

117
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
It's possible he said

118
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
That peanut butter M&M's

119
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
Are more expensive

120
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,855
That's true you'd want to put less of them in the package

121
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
Is the way to keep the profit margin the same

122
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,231
You're not going to tell you if you're not going to do wonders for your business

123
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,535
If you bring out a new product

124
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
Pitch Perfect movie images

125
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,679
I was like if you had M&M's are out there there's a certain profit margin

126
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
You've been introduced

127
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
Peanut butter M&M's you would never want to introduce that

128
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
Where you're going to make less money on a

129
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
I like the sex

130
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711
Exactly what my sister has an NBA total

131
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
She thought was going on also

132
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
It made sense because

133
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,879
Imagine you introduce your exciting new peanut butter-filled Eminem

134
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
And people like them so much

135
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,743
They stopped buying the original milk

136
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Chocolate and

137
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,047
And they switch to the peanut butter

138
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,655
If you're making less money per pack on the peanut butter ones

139
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,959
Congratulations your wonderful new product

140
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Just lost you

141
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:08,383
Of course Mars could keep the profit margin the Same by discharging a little more than a dollar for the peanut butter M&M

142
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,687
Instead of putting Less in the package

143
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
John gourville

144
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
Professor of marketing at Harvard says

145
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
That's a really dumb idea

146
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
And companies almost never do

147
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
Imagine

148
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,439
Imagine if you did this with something like yogurt

149
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
Where

150
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
You know the peach yogurt is $0.79 the blueberry yogurt is $0.89 and the strawberry yogurt is nice

151
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
99 cents

152
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,543
You now are getting people thinking she's how much do I like strawberry relative to pee

153
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
Each is it worth a $0.20

154
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,431
It's just it's it's a layer of complexity that

155
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,991
Manufacturers would prefer not to get into

156
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
They want to make the decision making

157
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,903
Companies would rather adjust the amount of stuff in each package

158
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,463
So they can keep everything the same price

159
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,023
So that when you go to buy say M&M's

160
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
You're not doing math in your head comparing prices

161
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,423
You just going yeah I'm Eminem and they're all a dollar which one do I want

162
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Even though the weights

163
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
If you look closely

164
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
Are slightly different

165
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,847
This was a beautiful Theory it explained everything

166
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
The dollar price of a later peanut butter M&M pack

167
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
It turns out unfortunately there's a problem

168
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,879
In order for it to be right peanut butter M&M's have to be more expensive to make

169
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
Remember that's why you get less in a package

170
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,767
But Bill Edwards the chemist told me that upon reflection

171
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,839
He's pretty sure peanut butter is cheaper than chocolate

172
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,399
I did some checking at bulk suppliers

173
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
And it seems to be

174
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
So much for the economic explanation

175
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
Maybe there was a scientific one

176
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
Is it okay if I buy a lot of Eminem

177
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,175
I went back down to the little store in the lobby of our building

178
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,527
And I bought what scientists would call a statistically significant sample size

179
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
Kennedy's

180
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
Spirit entities

181
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,207
I took the M&M's up to Columbia University

182
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,535
To a guy who had a really really precise scale

183
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,119
Sanat Kumar he's chair of the chemical engineering

184
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,727
Yeah this is a tenth of a gram and this is going to vent of a milligram

185
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,031
A thousand times smaller than what you looking for

186
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,335
This is a thousand times more accurate than we need

187
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
Talk about a little bit of an Overkill

188
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
0 that

189
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
It's not have a different

190
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
What if he said

191
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,831
Each bag gets filled by a machine

192
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,391
The drops that precise number of M&M's

193
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Beach bag

194
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
Same number in each bag

195
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,279
Then if the peanut butter M&M's turn out to be a little bit later

196
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,095
That could explain why the package came out lighter

197
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
So we started Counting

198
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,959
Can 1214

199
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,007
One bag has 27

200
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
Another had 28

201
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,663
728 not keeping the number constant

202
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
It's all over the map

203
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,247
This is truly amazing

204
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
I have no idea what they're doing

205
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,111
Another beautiful Theory destroyed by date

206
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
We did discover something weird though

207
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
It would turn out to be

208
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Critical clue

209
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,303
Something that somehow I'd never realized when I was shutting these things in my

210
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,911
And it's that the peanut butter M&Ms and the regular M&M's

211
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,215
Are totally different species

212
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,103
Original milk chocolate M&Ms are these small very precise candies with very precise weights

213
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,431
The peanut butter M&M's by comparison or Monster

214
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
Lumpier

215
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Larger

216
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
We measured with the fancy scale

217
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,623
And a larger size turns out to be key to the whole puzzle

218
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,743
David pieces it all together after the break

219
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,887
Support for this podcast and the following message come from Delta

220
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
Delta flies to 300 cities around the world

221
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
Best 300 cities

222
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,055
It's where many people do the same things you do

223
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:55,455
That's 300 cities were people in those 300 cities think they're the only ones who know about that

224
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,783
One place and 300 cities where people miss someone

225
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,855
One and one of Delta's other 299 cities

226
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:08,511
Delta isn't flying to 300 cities merely to bring people together but to show that we're not that far apart

227
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Martin the first

228
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
Delta

229
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Keep climbing

230
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
Eventually got an email back from the Mars come

231
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
Declining our interview

232
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,495
Requests but it did include a statement

233
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
Which I think

234
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
Explains the whole mystery

235
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,615
Is nothing to do with the price of peanuts compared

236
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Hector Coco

237
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,455
Or the number of M&M's that get dropped in the little bags

238
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
It was a different number

239
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Calories

240
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,599
The statement said that for health and nutrition reasons

241
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
All Mars products are designed to be

242
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,463
250 calories or less

243
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Proportion

244
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535
It's not and I did the math

245
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,375
And it turns out because the peanut butter-filled M&M's are so big

246
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
If you add adjust

247
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,215
One more of them to the little packages

248
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,287
It would push the calorie count over 250

249
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,591
This Mark seems to be saying

250
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
Is why the package

251
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Which weighs a little bit

252
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,223
I ran this by Joelle Glenn Brenner who wrote the book

253
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
On Mars and Hershey

254
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
The only Outsider who been allowed in

255
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
Do you believe this

256
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
That's on right to absolutely

257
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,903
She says the 250-calorie thing

258
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,695
That's become a kind of maximum

259
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
A line that the candy companies

260
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Don't want to cross

261
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
Unacceptable

262
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
Snack

263
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Calorie

264
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Sauce

265
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
Anything larger than that you're talking like hamburger territory or something that's just too big that's not a

266
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,103
There was one other little things that still bug me

267
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
Why were the peanut butter M&M sober

268
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Do I'll have an answer for this

269
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,807
Besides she thinks has been a long-standing problem

270
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Album from Mars

271
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,695
Mars as big breakthrough with that the filling for its peanut butter M&M who's actual peanut butter

272
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
Reese's Pieces she says actually contain something called pinotage

273
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Peanut meal

274
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
Which is easier to work with

275
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Weather coat

276
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
True peanut butter she says

277
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
Is softer lumpier

278
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Hard to work with

279
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
I am certain

280
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
But they did

281
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,639
Did herbal amount of engineering research

282
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,711
Search to see if there was any way possible

283
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
To reduce the overall size

284
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
Of that

285
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
Peanut butter M&M

286
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
So they could avoid this dilemma

287
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,463
I got avoid me calling them absolutely

288
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
But

289
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,047
They must have hit some wall

290
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,935
Where it just simply wasn't possible can get them any smaller and smaller

291
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,751
I sent Mars a follow-up email asking

292
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,335
Why the peanut butter M&M's were so much larger than the regular ones

293
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
The next day I got a one-sentence answer

294
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
Call

295
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,711
Because of proprietary reasons

296
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
We are unable to elaborate

297
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
On the size of peanut butter

298
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:49,279
