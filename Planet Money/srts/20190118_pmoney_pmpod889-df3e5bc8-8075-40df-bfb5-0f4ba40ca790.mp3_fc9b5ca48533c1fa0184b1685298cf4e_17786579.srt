1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,304
He's a big deal now

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,144
The founder of Panera Bread but that's when he was in college he was just

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,168
Ron

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,240
Shake some team getting kicked out of stores

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Twist out of a local convenience store where you got kicked out of a convenience store in college what did you do

6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,944
They accused of shoplifting I did nothing

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,504
Are you sure I am positive

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,552
Okay Ron Shake

9
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,600
Vowed to never go back to this

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,624
Play Store

11
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,184
We open our own non-profit convenience store

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,232
If they don't appreciate our business

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,816
Let's let's do our own Ron was 19 years old when he

14
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,864
Restore honest college campus

15
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,144
What did you sell

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,168
We sold

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,240
Everything you might want on a college campus

18
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:47,104
I know crackers and snacks the beverages cleaning supplies

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,872
Ron

20
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,920
Was good at opening stores

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,248
He went on to build this little cafe called Au Bon Pain

22
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,272
Into a big chain

23
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,832
And out of that came another big chain called

24
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:57,856
Panera Bread

25
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,160
There more than 2000 Panera's now

26
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:05,792
And he runs a good guy is the kind of guy takes his kids to volunteer at food banks on the weekend

27
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,864
And while they are volunteering he starts thinking that

28
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,912
Food pantries are actually really

29
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
Inefficient

30
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,960
You might as well

31
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Just write a check

32
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,032
And then one night he's watching the

33
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,824
It was actually a rerun

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
IBM PC

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
She said

36
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,432
And they have the story about this Cafe in Denver

37
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
Caught saying

38
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
Short for so all May

39
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,832
That allows customers to pay what they want

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
There's the menu with no prices

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,232
And the customer those with and those without

42
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,024
At same Cafe

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,328
It didn't matter if you had money to pay for your meal

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
Imran's thinking

45
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
The sounds great

46
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168
I can do something like this

47
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,240
I said we open a cafe every two days

48
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,080
We have more equipment more resources more capabilities

49
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,640
This is this is something we could do

50
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
He thinks Panera can do this

51
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
Faster

52
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
Bigger

53
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016
And better private sector official

54
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,856
And this is the moment he decides he'll open non-profit version

55
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Panera's

56
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,184
They look and taste like any other

57
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
The customers can decide what they want

58
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
MyPay

59
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,584
I fundamentally believe that there were enough good people in the world

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
That they would do the right thing

61
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,912
But I particularly loved

62
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
Torturing the cynics

63
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
Who were arguing you know

64
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,640
Everybody we know Ruby lunch on Uncle Ron Ron was making a big

65
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
Bet

66
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,480
Not just on the business but on human nature

67
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,088
That wealthy people and poor people would want to sit side-by-side for lunch

68
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
And that people would be

69
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
So generous that

70
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
These restaurants would break

71
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
Even

72
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
And a professor who really knows consumers

73
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
Was watching all this

74
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
With a lot of it

75
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
What was your first impression of the idea

76
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,008
My first impression of the idea was this will never work

77
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Sarah Gonzales household name

Today on the show an experiment and charity that goes right to the heart of

80
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Human Nature

81
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,976
The relationship between what we believe in

82
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:11,744
And

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,304
What we will actually spend money on

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
It's a story about homelessness

85
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
Broccoli cheddar soup

86
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:22,752
And the war between good and evil that rages within every consumer

How to save 10% off

102

Your first purchase of a website or domain

103
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
Panera's are kind of like

104
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
Fancy or fast

105
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
They're a little healthier and a little pricier

106
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,968
And when Ron said he was going to let customers

107
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,784
Pay whatever they wanted for Panera food

108
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
He decided Beast

109
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,392
Special cafes needed to be in areas where there were enough

110
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Horror

111
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
People

112
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,488
Who could benefit from the generosity of enough

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Welfare PA

114
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,815
Our whole idea here was not

115
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,863
Simply to create another

116
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,423
Homeless shelter another soup kitchen

117
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
It was actually the have

118
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
A real meal

119
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
And a real meal with dignity

120
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
So he creates a non-profit arm

121
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
Call Panera cares

122
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
Instead of cash registers

123
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,991
The cares cafes have donation bins

124
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
All the prices on the menu

125
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
I just suggested

126
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,111
Note to give customers

127
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,671
Some idea of how much food actually cost

128
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,487
And the whole idea and hope here

129
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,839
Is that enough wealthier customers will pay more than the suggested price

130
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
So the needy can eat

131
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
For Less

132
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,471
The first location opened in Clayton Missouri near st.

133
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
Saint Louis into

134
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:04,895
Ron actually step down as CEO to get it off the ground I can remember the first day we open the cap

135
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
I waited on customers

136
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,527
I waited behind the counter I worked 100 hours that next week into calf

137
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
Run then opens more nonprofit Panera's

138
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
Chicago Boston Portland

139
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
In Oregon

140
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
And Dearborn Michigan right outside

141
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Detroit

142
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,535
I was a reporter in the area then

143
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
Remember thinking

144
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
Hunger such a big problem

145
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Maybe this could actually

146
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,215
No big restaurant corporation had ever tried this

147
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,847
And there was one Professor who studies consumer behavior and consumer ethics who was thinking

148
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:39,455
What Ronnie's proposing goes against everything I know about how can see

149
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,223
Zoomers

150
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,063
What is the most depressing thing you've learned in

151
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,367
Studying consumer ethics

152
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Oh my gosh

153
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,023
That's a wow there's a deep well to attitude to pull from

154
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,911
Tiana Eckhardt is a professor of marketing at Royal Holloway University of

155
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Well

156
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:05,823
I'll answer that by telling you that the title of my most recent book on this

157
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Topic which

158
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Just called the myth of the ethical

159
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Consumer

160
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
Yep

161
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
There are no ethical consumers

162
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,807
Gianna says how people feel about a social issue like

163
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,623
Hunger and how they behave in the marketplace

164
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,415
Are two totally different

165
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975
Meaning like I

166
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,047
Can hate sweatshops but I might still buy a pair of

167
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
Tennis shoes

168
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
That

169
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,143
Turn the brand that uses Sweatshop labor

170
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,423
Exactly

171
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,727
So she's like I have to follow runs

172
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
Experiment she actually observed

173
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
These cafes for years

174
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
These Panera cares cafes got going

175
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,663
Soon they were serving 4000 people

176
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,479
And of course there were a few early problem

177
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
Like Ron had designed these

178
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
Big signs

179
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
Explain the model

180
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
The menu the mission

181
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,927
We put so much energy into building the sign to tell people

182
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,975
To do the right thing Pay What You Want

183
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
Pay-what-you-can

184
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Pay it forward

185
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,607
Apparently people don't read signs

186
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,679
Everyone was confused like what do you mean

187
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
Suggested prices

188
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:11,103
So now they have to spend money to hire someone who could stand at the door and explain how this whole thing work

189
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,199
But whatever like they were serving the needy this is what run wanted

190
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,855
And you know there's a certain kind of person who's going to show up when you do something like this like this kid to take the whole

191
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
Bowl of Halloween candy

192
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Yeah they showed up

193
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,975
I can literally remember

194
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
Couple of kids

195
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Local

196
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,119
Oak kids walked into our store in in Clayton Missouri

197
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
And they

198
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
Walked up to the counter kind of laughing

199
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
And they said I'll have

200
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
3 smoothies and then

201
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
2

202
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
Roast beef sandwiches

203
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
And here's my Dad's credit card

204
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
Put three bucks on

205
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,527
I just wanted to jump over that counter and I wanted to grab the kid around the neck and Wacom

206
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
I just want to say don't you get it

207
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
Somebody else has got to pay

208
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
Ron had to

209
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Keep battling

210
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
People's bad impulse

211
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511
Even his own staff

212
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
They started judging

213
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
Profiling

214
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
People would walk in

215
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
And

216
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
We would

217
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
Assume

218
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
We knew

219
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
Either

220
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
Based on how they looked

221
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
Based on how they were

222
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
Dressed

223
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,991
Potentially Dredd based on the color of their skin

224
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,807
What they were going to do the staff would be like

225
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Wait

226
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
How much did you put in the bin

227
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
You look like you could give a bit more

228
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,487
He ends up putting the staff through sensitivity training

229
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,047
But he's really happy with the experiment

230
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:38,143
About six months in reims as more than half of the customers were paying

231
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
The suggested price

232
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
About 20%

233
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
Extra

234
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
And the other 20%

235
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Sometimes

236
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
They paid nothing at all

237
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Hate free soup

238
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
Which overall sounds

239
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Great

240
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,223
But what Gianna is singing

241
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
Sitting there on all her visit

242
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Looks a little different

243
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
At the beginning

244
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:03,487
People who were homeless were bringing in every possession that they owned into the Panera which was typically

245
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,375
In like a shopping cart that's how they would keep their possessions and so you would see all of these shopping carts around

246
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,447
Which also smelled in addition to the people themselves

247
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,239
Set of the managers had to

248
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
Yeah come up with rules about the size of bags that you could bring in and things like that to

249
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,199
To manage that situation

250
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,759
It fell on employees in these cafes.

251
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,319
To deal with issues that they weren't really qualify

252
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Like

253
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Mental Health

254
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Can drug issues

255
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
Sharon Davis work

256
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
Did the Portland

257
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
I was probably one of the oldest

258
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
People there

259
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,863
Stop this kind of like Grandma Sharon type of thing Grandma Sharon saw the best

260
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
And worse

261
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
People who was a customer sitting there and she comes up

262
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
Oh my God

263
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
These people are stink

264
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
I can't stand eating like this

265
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,383
Next to I'm really sorry

266
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
But they are entitled to a meal

267
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,503
You try to be very very dignus in a graceful about it

268
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,319
And the bathrooms in particular were a big

269
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,415
Try customers were doing things in there that Grandma Sharon should not

270
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,487
Be quite a few of them that were shooting up in there

271
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,815
When they come out the door you know they were loaded

272
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,375
And we'd open the door and look and there's blood everywhere

273
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,935
So then we have to close that bathroom

274
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
Sharon says they were trying to do their best

275
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
They would refer customers to rehab

276
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Open shelters

277
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Jobs

278
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
And things like that

279
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,407
But this experiment was really about food

280
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,527
And employees like Sharon told us the real problem was that these cafes

281
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:35,135
Worrying attracting enough generous people who wanted to pay more

282
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,487
So pretty early on Panera's cafe started telling customers that

283
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,791
If they didn't have money to pay

284
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,351
They could volunteer for an hour and it

285
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,887
Exchange for a meal you know

286
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
Clean under the counter

287
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
The first store was in business

288
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
For 8 years

289
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
But then it closed

290
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,335
Go to the ones in Dearborn Chicago in

291
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
Panera says it did not make Finance

292
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Stan's two

293
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,455
Continue to operate Panera

294
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
They're no longer trying to

295
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Food banks at their own

296
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Panera is back

297
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,855
Tube donating to them

298
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
Writing check

299
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,927
Sharon said she had a month's notice

300
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,303
We poured our last coffee together out of the coffee machine and

301
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,375
Then we closed the door and we all just stood there and looked

302
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,447
New y'all gave each other hugs and so we'll be in touch

303
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
And

304
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
We left

305
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
The parking lot for the last time

306
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
And

307
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,943
Gianna our consumer expert says Ron was just kind of naive about the whole thing

308
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,271
He didn't understand how those with

309
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
And those without

310
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
Would behave next to

311
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,927
To each other what ended up happening is the people who

312
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,719
We're not food insecure

313
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
Did not want

314
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
To eat lunch with p

315
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
People who were food in

316
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,119
And Jenna says those who were food into

317
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,727
Secured didn't necessarily feel comfortable sitting next to those with more means

318
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Either

319
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
But Ron is a belief

320
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Even today

321
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
He says

322
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
The Cafe is closed

323
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Because they're beasts

324
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
Rap in the rent

325
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Skyrocket

326
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,199
Not because I didn't

327
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,503
At work what do you say to people

328
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
Who say maybe you didn't understand

329
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,367
Like human nature when you started

330
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
Wizard

331
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
Excuse me

332
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,951
Write this thing work

333
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Usurped

334
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
Millions of people

335
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
Over many many

336
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Years

337
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,959
And so the fact that at the end of five years or seven or eight we close the store

338
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,519
By no means means that this wasn't a success

339
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
Gianna says there are other models

340
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
I could have worked better

341
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,919
Like Panera could make people feel like they're getting

342
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
A gift

343
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
Gibbs

344
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
Make us feel

345
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
Guilty they make us feel like we have

346
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
To give back

347
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Their pizza shops

348
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
Some coffee shops in the US that do this already

349
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,207
A lot of the ones that have been more successful than

350
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:51,583
Panera cares tend to be a pay-it-forward model rather than a pay-what-you-can model

351
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,167
So say it's like a coffee shop for example you're told

352
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:00,287
Someone who came here before you has paid for your coffee and your handed a free coffee

353
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,079
That's a

354
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
The good one

355
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,943
Yeah and then your ass would you like to pay for someone else's

356
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
Coffee

357
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Of course

358
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,551
Yes and because this is framed as a gift

359
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,599
It tends to be quite powerful

360
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
So you think I've received a gift

361
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,695
From someone that I don't even know

362
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
And this summer

363
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,047
I should repay that gift is a very

364
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,631
A very strong Instinct inside people I think

365
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
Another thing that would work better

366
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,983
Take those suggested prices off the menu

367
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
If you see a price

368
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
Tiana says you think that's the amount you

369
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
You should pay with no price

370
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
People actually give more

371
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
The cafe in Denver the one that is

372
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
Inspired run that's what they do no prices

373
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
Yes soup salad and

374
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
That's what we serve every day

375
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
Brad Rivendell run Steam caffe

376
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
And it turns out they're actually

377
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
Pretty different from

378
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Panera cares

379
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
They never wanted to come

380
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,303
Fleetly rely on the generosity of P

381
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,911
People they don't want to be self-sustaining they fundraise they have a big Gala every year

382
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,751
And Brad says that if more than half of their customers are paying

383
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
They're doing something wrong

384
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:09,151
It becomes a place where wealthy white people feel good about eating but it doesn't actually serve the mission

385
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,479
Brad says it's actually a terrible business model

386
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
If you're trying to break you

387
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
This was designed to be a charity

388
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
It runs like a non-profit

389
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,183
And it was actually designed to help the people it serves

390
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
Like there are cubby

391
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
So homeless people have a place

392
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
To leave their stuff

393
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
There are with a call

394
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
Introvert tables

395
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
The people can

396
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
Sit there and pee

397
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Bistro hours

398
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,471
You know I'm a I'm a middle-class white guy

399
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:40,127
And so if I ever want to be left alone I go pay $5 for an overpriced coffee and no one's going to bother me but many of our guest there

400
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
They are carrying all of their

401
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,223
Belongings if they own are made to feel uncomfortable in

402
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:51,135
Even if they pay for a coffee I haven't thought about it like that but white men do love sitting by themselves

403
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Coffee shops

404
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
And we're good at it

405
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,767
But there is one Panera cares left

406
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
After the break

407
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
We go

408
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
And we pay what we want

409
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,679

Capital One na

419
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:21,855
Dan and I are in the one remaining pay-what-you-want Panera cares it's embossed

420
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
And they take their bathrooms

421
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
Security very seriously

422
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,743
They change their bathroom codes multiple times

423
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
Today what's the code right now

424
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
Dakotaz 8053

29921 7

426
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
The ladies room

427
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
How do you remember that

428
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
Hahaha

429
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
I make a man I'm kind of a

430
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
This is Perry Como

431
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,871
The manager of Panera cares

432
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,735
Pretty much like any Panera with a few little differences like there is this wall of

433
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,527
Day old bread when you walk in

434
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
This bread walls for anybody else that's in need

435
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,415
You can come in we have been here you can add what you can

436
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,231
Grab a loaf of bread bring it to the cashiers and weed spices

437
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Good for you

438
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
Donation

439
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:09,215
Right into the wind here is not allowed in there right now is at 4 bucks it's not for profit everything is suggested amount

440
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
I've actually never been to a Panera

441
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,615
So what should I order that sounds like they like gateway drugs

442
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
Panera

443
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Okay let's order something

444
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
We see those

445
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
Clear donation bins

446
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
Plexiglass plastic

447
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
But you have to look really closely

448
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
See the tiny type

449
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
The top of the menu

450
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,511
It says the prices are just suggested donation

451
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,071
Okay I'm going to do the broccoli cheddar soup

452
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Soup

453
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
You like me to Nation today

454
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,471
Meaning like I can donate 928 or I cannot donate 928

455
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519
It's up to you to just place your value in the bin

456
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Overmuch you wish to donate I got

457
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
20

458
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:54,015
So I'll do that

459
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,087
How much should you how much should you pay for a $10

460
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
She told me that I donated

461
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
30 what is that $0.32

462
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
The next person that I felt like

463
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
Yusuke like I should put more money

464
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,631
Yeah that is a little cheaper but you got to come on but I saw you like hold a water bills

465
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
Into the band and just hold it there for like a minute

466
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,031
It was like I was just trying to

467
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:21,151
Fit in the little slot so many bills cuz you're so generous

468
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
Right now this store

469
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Loses

470
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
Barry says

471
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
They cover about 85

472
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
Percent of their cause

473
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,111
Panera makes up the rest

474
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
Think this place will be here in a year

475
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
I know it'd be here in a year

476
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
What makes you so sure

477
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
Cuz we run it right

478
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,303
We treat people respect

479
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,375
And it was actually really nice

480
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:48,031
Be like there were customers on laptop sitting next to you and talking to people in need people

481
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,103
Eating three loaves of unsliced bread out of the bag

482
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,175
There were people volunteering in exchange for food

483
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:59,551
And I have to say in the end I felt guilty about the $0.32 I donated

484
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
Dropped a few more bucks

485
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
