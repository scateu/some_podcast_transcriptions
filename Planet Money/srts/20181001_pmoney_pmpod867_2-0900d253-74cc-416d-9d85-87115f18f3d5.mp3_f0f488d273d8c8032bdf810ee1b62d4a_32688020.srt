1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,536
Quick note

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03,840
This episode has some explicit language

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:07,424
When Lawrence left jiangshi province

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,192
SuperAmerica

5
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,496
He arrived with the usual

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:14,592
I think I will be calling me there now. You're going to become a millionaire

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,176
So is quite have a lot of confidence in myself

8
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,480
But New York put him in his place

9
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
Really fast

10
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,832
He fell into a miserable string of odd jobs

11
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,368
Jobs working illegally

12
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,672
First set of Window and Door Company than

13
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,952
Glass Factory

14
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,488
Nothing lasts

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,280
Sometime I even me

16
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,864
Didn't know why I bother coming over to

17
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,960
Working for those ready jobs

18
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,776
Those what jobs

19
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
Ice a shity job

20
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,104
Ocean City okay

21
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,664
City I know that word okay

22
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,480
And then one day well he was still down in the

23
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,784
He saw an ad in the paper

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,368
An immigration law office near Chinatown needed a Chinese

25
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,136
Translator

26
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:03,232
Finally a prestigious opportunity a law firm

27
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,768
Apply for the job

28
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
You got it

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072
But

30
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,864
When he walked into this

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,400
Oppressive new law firm

32
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,936
He saw Jesus

33
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,216
Three decks

34
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
Crammed into one tiny room

35
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
That was the whole

36
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,336
Office

37
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,872
Every phone call

38
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Cough

39
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,432
Everybody heard everything

40
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,760
And what Lawrence heard most often

41
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
We're Chinese immigrants

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,368
Coming by and ask him for help

43
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,672
Getting asylum in the US

44
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,696
Which

45
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
Don't nice Torrance

46
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,816
He had just recently won Asylum himself and now

47
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
He could help other Chinese people

48
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
Do the exact same

49
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,520
By the way we're not using his real name for reasons that will become very clear later on

50
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
And with more closely

51
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,896
Lawrence listened from his tiny corner of that

52
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
Tiny office

53
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,992
The more he started to realize that these were

54
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Very special

55
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
Asylum cases

56
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
Yes Lord From

57
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,952
From the beginning like what what did you say

58
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,024
The office manager with talked to the client

59
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,072
About what kind of

60
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
Storage for makeup

61
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,680
What kind of fake documentation provides

62
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
Made up those doors

63
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,520
Where it says

64
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,056
The Weir he worked for

65
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,872
Do so much specialized in Asylum

66
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Loft

67
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
As an asylum

68
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Broad

69
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
And then I realized

70
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,808
This is Open Secret

71
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,624
Chinese immigrant community

72
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,000
Men in Chinese people making Santa Claus

73
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,608
What brands had stumbled into was an underground Network

74
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
Professional

75
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
Story writers

76
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
Coaches and

77
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
Scammers

78
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
Gaming the asylum

79
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Hello and welcome to planet

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,064
Money I know the Chang and I'm Karen Duffin Asylum and become a huge business in Chinatown

81
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
And it's incredibly important work

82
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,512
Helping immigrants please sometimes the worst imaginable circumstance

83
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,328
But whenever there's a system setup

84
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
Fulfilled good intentions

85
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
There will be people who will exploit it

86
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,544
In Florence found himself working for those people and then

87
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Ultimately

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
He found himself at the

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
The center of

90
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
What could be one of the biggest

91
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
Crackdowns on Asylum fraud

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
In Isis history

93
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,320
I had no idea how

94
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
Complicated this story was going to be

95
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,952
When I started looking into the Asylum business the half year ago

96
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,792
I thought this was just going to be a story about one Chinese asylee

97
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
He was facing deportation

98
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
But as I investigated her case

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,216
I quickly discovered it wasn't just her

100
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,824
There are 13000 more people in her situation

101
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,408
A group of people whose stories haven't been told yet

102
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,968
These are mostly Chinese immigrants

103
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
Who could also

104
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,040
I'll be losing their Asylum status

105
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
We have to say

106
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
This is a story that

107
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,464
Took us to some pretty uncomfortable places

108
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
Unchallenged

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
What we thought we knew

110
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
The Asylum process

111
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:23,935

115
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,015
Alright so back in Chinatown in Manhattan

116
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
It's mm

117
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,623
And Lawrence is working for a lawyer named Ken trial

118
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,999
Greasy guy who Lawrence says Randy office in kind of an absent minded

119
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
And grew up in Oklahoma City

120
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,143
Where he says he never met a single Chinese

121
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Person

122
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,727
He graduated from law school later than most

123
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
Wellington

124
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
His 30s

125
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
And he stumbled into Asylum work

126
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,383
After answering an ad in the New York Law Journal

127
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,967
You know I was thinking myself so I don't know what kind of lawyer I'm going to be

128
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
What

129
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,807
If somebody wants to hire me to be a lawyer

130
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
That's the kind of lawyer I'm going to be

131
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,439
By the Time Warren Smith

132
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,279
Can cats have more than 80% of his

133
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
Cases for Asylum cases

134
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
It's you

135
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
It is absolutely huge

136
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
Everybody I know

137
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,287
The Praxis immigration law that has Chinese cases

138
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,711
It's mostly Asylum Asylum is a form of protection that the u.s. government gives to immigrants who are trying to

139
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Escape person

140
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
Succession in their home country

141
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,879
In 2016 more than 20,000 people got Asylum here

142
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,719
And four years Chinese immigrants have been the most

143
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
Successful at getting it

144
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,095
The Chinese apply the most often and they win the most often

145
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,679
But in Ken Giles is office they were winning

146
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
By cheating

147
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,031
And Lord says he was really torn about this

148
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,175
He knew this was against the law and that there were people out there who truly deserved Asylum

149
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,735
But once was also an immigrant

150
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,063
Sometimes I justify in this way I say okay I'm helping people

151
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
I'm helping those

152
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
Lower class

153
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
Chinese people to get their status United States

154
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,791
They Don't Really commit a crime they don't do what they want just

155
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,607
Spanish job here and walking the Chinese restaurant

156
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
So that's the way I drop

157
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Justify

158
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
My wrongdoings

159
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,519
And the more he justified his wrongdoings

160
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,823
The deeper Warren Scott

161
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
Until eventually he landed at

162
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,943
One of the biggest Asylum operation

163
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,015
Probably the largest Law Firm

164
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
Inside of town at the moment

165
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,903
It was a law firm run by a woman named funling love you

166
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,743
And it was everything at Ken Giles office was not

167
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
It was a model of a fishing

168
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,143
Asylum applications were manufactured along an assembly line

169
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,471
Where each worker was assigned a specific task

170
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
Picture of us

In

173
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
The area we're working on

174
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
Some people was just

175
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
Answering the phone

176
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
All dealing with client

177
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
Some of them just coaching

178
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,415
Some of them just writing stories station in this assembly line

179
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Writing story

00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,791
Kitty hold up all day in room designated only for story writer

00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
Trying out

182
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,119
We made up a silent place

183
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Our f

184
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
After hour

185
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,775
Getaway at Lawrence had the most important job

186
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
A ball because

187
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
The key to getting Asylum

188
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Is the story

189
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
You tell the US government

190
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
It has to be a story about

191
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
Suffering

192
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
But only a certain

193
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Kind of

194
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,391
The kind of suffering the government has deemed worthy of its protection

195
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
And the suffering that counts in the system

196
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231
Is targeted

197
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Persecution

198
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,327
Based on your race your religion political opinion

199
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,399
Or some particular social group

200
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
You belong to

201
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
And something like fake gang violence

202
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
That doesn't usually count

203
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
Just not targeted enough

204
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
But the story is Chinese asylees tell

205
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,407
They tend to check the right box

206
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:23,039
Like abortions forced by the Chinese government's Family Planning policy or

207
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,879
Government oppression for supporting democracy or for being

208
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:31,231
Christian and Lord found the best place to start stories like that

209
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Was actually

210
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
Wintergreen

211
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,167
Say a woman really did have an abortion in China even if it was by choice

212
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,263
He'd spend that into a story about an abortion forced by the government

213
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,591
Or if a client enjoyed some real life

214
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Tragedy

215
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
He would say that tragedy

216
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
Is why she converted

217
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
To Christianity

218
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,527
Little specks of Truth spun just right

219
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
And you have yourself

220
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
An asylum

221
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
Like with Johnny Lee

222
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
She was a Chinese immigrant

223
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,207
To have run out of ways to stay in the

224
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
Until my aunt said

225
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
Just come to Asylum

226
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,351
Do gangaajal Hindi

227
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,679
Southlake people all around me for doing it

228
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
Common people I worked with

229
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
People in my circle

230
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,359
From what I could tell applying for Asylum to stay in this country

231
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,175
It was just a normal thing to do

232
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
It seemed like everyone was doing it

233
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
Tidewater

234
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
Tellonym Condado

235
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
And that's when warrants met Johnny

236
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
It was spring of 2011

237
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
Johnny was

238
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
A model

239
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,559
Client she was 29 college-educated which men

240
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
You can memorize more made up facts

241
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:45,727
Also Johnny actually did get an abortion in China but willingly

242
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
And she had occasionally

243
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Time to church

244
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,847
So Lawrence just took all of that

245
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,943
And basically just turned up the volume a bit and gave them a twist

246
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,527
Who's the twist that even Jenny found a bit

247
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Much

248
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,855
We're going to have our interpreter

249
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,927
Read from the actual Asylum statement that Lawrence wrote

250
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
For her

251
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
I was stopped

252
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,023
Hi to Family Planning cadres

253
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
At the entrance of my apartment

254
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
I knew the consequences

255
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,703
So I struggled against them at all my strength

256
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
But they pulled me to a nearby Van

257
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
By force

258
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,383
Drove me to the fictional Johnny is forced to get an abortion

259
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
She didn't slumps into

260
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,015
Depression what happened to me in the hospital

261
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,807
Became my night

262
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,111
What she finds her way out of by

263
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,439
Becoming a devout Christian the Lord Jesus Is Our Shepherd

264
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
Who's love

265
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
Healed the wounds in my heart

266
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Until one day

267
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
They accused us

268
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
Of Traders

269
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
Please spread the Western evil

270
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,799
Colt the police officers try to get her to sign a confession letter

271
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,103
Cheap fuses thereafter

272
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
The beat me

273
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
When they found I did not cooperate with them

274
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,015
I was slapped in my face several times

275
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
And kicked several times

276
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
Even sexually harassed by them

277
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
So this was Johnny's Asylum

278
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,975
And now she had to play the part

279
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
She's at the law office had to go to church

280
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
A lot 4 times a week

281
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
Until she got a baptism

282
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,447
And then Lawrence coached her for the Asylum interview

283
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
He told her

284
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
What questions to expect help us

285
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
To answer them

286
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,383
And next he helped her rehearsed her fake Asylum story

287
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
This incident

288
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,735
Gave me a big blow over and over again

289
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,295
I was depressed for a while

290
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
I could not perform as usual

291
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
And then I love this last line

292
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
I beseech

293
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
The US government

294
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
To let us

295
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Stay

296
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
And not

297
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
To send us back

298
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
To the hell like

299
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
China

300
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,519
Elmo Spaghetti House Lockport AR

301
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,103
I read that story and it sounded

302
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
So

303
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
Fake like

304
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
Just called you always

305
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
Okay

306
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
Outsider

307
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
Photos of style officer

308
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
Immigration charge

309
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,535
By this kind of fake story every day so they don't know what

310
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,839
Real story stupid looking like

311
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,631
In other words to Lawrence

312
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
The Asylum system was so

313
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
Drenched in light

314
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
That true stories of suffering

315
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
No longer sounded worthy of asylum

316
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,127
The truth just wasn't dramatic enough anymore

317
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
You almost had to lie

318
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
He said

319
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
To rise above the noise

320
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,319
Sonny Lee was granted asylum on June 28th

321
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
2011

322
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
On her first try

323
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,999
Lawrence says he wrote five to six hundred stories this way

324
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:53,631
He also mapped out which Asylum officers were more likely to accept certain kinds of Asylum stories

325
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Say

326
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,495
You're meeting with officer George I want to tell him an abortion story

327
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,311
If you meet with Officer Sally and you want to say that you

328
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
Converted to Christianity

329
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,151
She's going to want to hear a few Bible stories

330
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,223
Was there a part of you that was kind of proud of yourself

331
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
That you were so good at this

332
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Kind of

333
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
Because I was speaking down the system

334
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
How did it feel

335
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,511
I just feel like they're not doing their job

336
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
This shouldn't love me

337
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
When the game so easy

338
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
That's how Lawrence.

339
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Gaming the asylums

340
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
System was

341
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Sport

342
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:35,103
And maybe people like Lawrence were able to game the system so easily because they were good at it

343
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,431
And maybe also because the lies they told

344
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,503
Are ones that many Americans believe

345
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
They were lies that

346
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,575
Supported the perception

347
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,135
That the communist government in China would

348
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Oppressed

349
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
But

350
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
4 years

351
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
He just got tired of it

352
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
He decided he just wanted to get

353
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
He wanted to get out of the

354
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
So

355
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Started

356
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Law School

357
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,263
He was determined to become a legitimate lawyer

358
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
To finally live that American Dream he came here

359
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,407
But then in the middle of his first semester

360
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
His cell phone ring

361
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
2 weeks before Thanksgiving

362
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
I got phone call

363
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
Is FBI agent

364
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,695
The FBI agent said we need to talk

365
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,535
After the break Lawrence gets

366
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
Thrown back in

367
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,143
Way Back Inn

368
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:37,311
Support for this podcast and the following message come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

More information is available at aecf. Org

372
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,647
Florence to meet him at the FBI office in Manhattan

373
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,207
Lawrence's wife who was pregnant at

374
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
The time jogging down the neck

375
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,327
She waited in the cafeteria well he went upstairs

376
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,655
And their Lawrence was greeted by two agents

377
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
Why don't them is Asian

378
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
Is a korean-american I believe so

379
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
Another one is

380
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
Regular white people

381
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
The agents told him

382
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:17,759
We know all about the Asylum fraud and we know that you are part of it

383
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
Here's how Lawrence says it all went down

384
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:25,951
The agents told him that the FBI had been tailing him for more than a year

385
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
They whipped out photos of Lawrence

386
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,351
Dinner with lawyers or other interpreters who are also in the Asylum business

387
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,679
And they told him a big raid was coming

388
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Something massive

389
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
Something really high-profile

390
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
And they said

391
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
Look

392
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,663
You can either join your colleagues in prison or you can help the FBI

393
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
So

394
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
She was born

395
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,015
Just inches from becoming a lawyer

396
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
His wife was pregnant

397
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
He wanted to

398
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
Stay in the US he fought

399
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,159
He should cooperate

400
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,487
But some of the people they wanted him to narc on

401
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Weir Danger

402
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,071
Seabird summer connected to human Smugglers

403
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,887
But he says the FBI told him Halo

404
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:11,007
If you cooperate we're going to protect you

405
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
And the music

406
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,871
A different name different social security number

407
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
Different occupation

408
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:24,575
Lawrence also says the FBI agents told him that they would make sure he would not get charged with any felonies

409
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,903
That way it would be easier to still become a US citizen

410
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,231
But we read the cooperation agreement he eventually signed

411
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
What she shared with us

412
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:37,631
And it doesn't contain those promises in fact it tells him he was still at risk of being deported

413
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:42,239
But whatever the government promised him in exchange for cooperating

414
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,079
Prince also had been feeling a little guilty about what he does

415
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,151
So when they approached him he decided

416
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
You know what

417
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
I'm not just going to

418
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:56,831
Leave this industry

419
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
So

420
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
Lauren stop

421
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:04,255
What kind of fake documentation for why

422
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,095
India on everything he knew

423
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
Chinese immigrant community

424
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
And so

425
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,215
Lawrence became the central Witness

426
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
In what the FBI would call

427
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,823
Operation fiction writer

428
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
Which course means

429
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
What was your code name

430
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
Yakult talk

431
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
What t o r q u e

432
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,831
Torque your code name was torque

433
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Yeah

434
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Torque

435
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,415
As in the force

436
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
That turns them

437
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,255
Lawrence became the FBI's

438
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,351
Twerk he turned their entire investigation around

439
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
Lawrence gave the agency a detail

440
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,495
Picture of all the people involved in pumping out fraudulent Asylum

441
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
Chinatown

442
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Flashing

443
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
He poured over photo

444
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
Identify

445
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,687
He turned over his huge study guide

446
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
Which plane laid out every step of

447
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
The fraud from

448
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
Story writing

449
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
Evidence fabrication

450
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
Interview coach

451
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:07,231
And then the FBI turned him into we're going to call him a special agent

452
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
They gave ancient

453
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
Twerksum spy gear

454
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
That's what I would expect

455
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:17,727
Something really sophisticated from FBI from FBI by next week

456
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
That's just like

457
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
Hearing aid

458
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
How to spell

459
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
So it looks like you were wearing a

460
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Hearing aid

461
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
Saints looks like that

462
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,247
A hearing aid with a ridiculously long cable

463
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,575
Sneaking underneath his FBI issued shirt

464
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
Every time you ask me too well

465
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Sure

466
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
The shirt that gave me

467
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,023
Oh that the shirt was really ugly

468
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
How to say

469
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
The recorder for his

470
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Special

471
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
Hearing aid microphone

472
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,239
Oldest conspicuously from his back pocket

473
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,567
And the special spy camera that they gave him

474
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,639
It's actually poked out from his shirt collar

475
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
Is a liger

476
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
Button

477
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
It looks like a big button the camera

478
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Yeah

479
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,319
An armed with this state-of-the-art

480
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
Spy gear

481
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
Twerk

482
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
Went back into the Asylum Mills and

483
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Started

484
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,999
Steam recordings in all

485
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,303
And one of his very first targets

486
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
What's a personal

487
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Ken Giles

488
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,959
The first Asylum lawyer he'd worked for in that tiny office

489
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,263
Lawrence had a special district

490
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,103
You didn't work very hard and I got really chapped

491
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
Peoplewhiz. What

492
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
You thought it was lazy

493
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
Yeah he was lazy Cruz why we were related

494
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,599
Tennille Ken Laurence offer to help him write

495
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
One last

496
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Location

497
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:45,279
Yeah completely made up story I never talk to that guy at all I didn't even call the client

498
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Then he walked into cans off

499
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
Turn on his camera

500
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,679
And recorded himself telling Ken all about how he

501
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,703
Fabricated

502
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
This Woman's entire Asylum stay

503
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,615
And we never got to see the video but Lauren says it showed 10

504
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
Raising the story that

505
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
Meetup

506
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,991
And in December 2012

507
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
Ken Giles got

508
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
A phone call

509
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,343
This is Agent

510
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,903
So-and-so with the FBI

511
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,975
We have a warrant for your arrest online

512
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
Award for my arrest

513
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Yeah

514
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
For what

515
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
Conspiracy to commit immigration

516
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,935
This is Ken Giles

517
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
Again and he says

518
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
The feds got it all

519
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
I Never Told

520
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,615
Anybody to pretend to be anything

521
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Never

522
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
That's a lie

523
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
That is a lie

524
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,807
I don't think so but

525
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
I don't know

526
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
You don't know because

527
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
Because I don't speak Chinese

528
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,327
Still can totally acknowledges

529
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,423
Is that many of the stories contained in the Asylum applications he signed

530
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,727
Exactly the same

531
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263
Over and over again

532
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,823
I mean a red background material

533
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,407
About forced abortions in China so I know what happened

534
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
You know

535
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
And if I were to bike

536
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,527
Oh yeah you know I had abortion you know

537
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Pretty cool

538
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,367
You know if they were like that

539
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
You know

540
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
But if they start crying

541
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,232
And exhibiting some sort of pain

542
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,024
When we're counting that

543
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
You wouldn't question it

544
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
Why would question it but

545
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
And I would tend to

546
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,704
Give him the benefit of the doubt

547
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,568
So why isn't your job to figure out if they're really telling the truth how do you do that if it's 50-50 though

548
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
You know me

549
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,456
And if you think what could be or couldn't be

550
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
How do you say no

551
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,064
Faced with a warrant for his arrest

552
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Ken Giles

553
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,648
Turned himself in at 9 a.m. sharp the neck

554
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:53,024
26 people have been charged in New York what happened to make false Asylum

555
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,352
In total operation fiction writer

556
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,168
Rounded up 30 immigration lawyers

557
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,960
Paralegals and interpreters

558
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,752
In December 2012

559
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,056
And prosecutors credited Lawrence

560
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,616
With providing evidence against at least

561
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
Half of those defendants

562
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,968
We reached out to immigration officials to weigh in on the

563
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,528
But they declined to do an interview

564
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
For the story

565
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:21,184
Ken Giles pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit immigration fraud and he got 2 years in prison

566
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,488
Is office manager also pleaded guilty

567
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,560
And funlings do you was found guilty at trial

568
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
And Lawrence at this point

569
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
People recognized him from the Chinese newspaper

570
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
They knew he was a government star Witness

571
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,288
Did you find him at the grocery store and on

572
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
On the street

573
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
Telling him

574
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
He was a traitor

575
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,688
And that deal that deal he says the government made with him you know

576
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
Protect you if you help us

577
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:49,088
He got charged with more serious crimes than even Ken Giles.

578
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
Find out if your life

579
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,208
How did they lie to my face how did they lie to you

580
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
I find out the truck

581
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
Friendly charger

582
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,352
Watch artem my boss

583
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,656
And then I found out I couldn't

584
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
Apply for us

585
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Cigarettes

586
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,288
The judge in Lawrence's case did cut him some slack

587
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,360
He got just six months probation even though he faced

588
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,664
A maximum of 25 years

589
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,736
But since Lawrence had pleaded guilty to

590
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Two felonies

591
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,856
It would then probably be much harder for him to become a US citizen

592
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,648
And the witness protection stuff

593
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,928
That also

594
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
Never happen

595
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
Fun Spot

596
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
How to get out of here

597
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
Get far

598
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,120
Far away from New York

599
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
So Lawrence did his best to disa

600
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:40,032
Sapir he got into a PhD program in Arizona and he moved there to start a new life

601
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:46,688
Started going by his Chinese name instead of his English one and the lawyers who were convicted in operation fiction

602
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,784
Writer they helped more than 3700 immigrants

603
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
When Asylum

604
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:57,184
And when one Republican Congressman heard about that Bob goodlatte of Virginia

605
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:03,584
He sent a letter to the justice department demanding that they reopen those Asylum cases

606
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,400
I figure out which of those clients lied

607
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,960
And should therefore lose their Asylum

608
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,568
And the lawyer who work most closely with goodlatte on that issue

609
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
Was a man in Tracy

610
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
Short

611
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,664
After Donald Trump was elected

612
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
President

613
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
Trumpet that lawyer

614
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
Casey short

615
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:25,600
Basically in charge of all the lawyers who overseed deportation

616
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,672
And as all of this was happening back in Washington

617
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,256
Steve Lawrence was in Arizona building a new life

618
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,816
Until one day he got a call

619
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,608
It was immigration officials

620
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
And they said

621
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
You're not done yet

622
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
Come back to New York

623
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:45,312
And their immigration officials let him into a room filled with a

624
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
Boxes

625
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
I said they needed him

626
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:51,968
Do identify the Asylum applications of former clients that he knew

627
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
Why

628
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,808
And then decide to get a ticket like

629
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
Funny kids

630
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,648
He says they called him again in March 2017

631
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
I miss

632
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
Two ice attorneys

633
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,000
They said they got 200 cases

634
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,560
Ice even planted decoy files in the Box

635
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,120
Lawrence knew exactly which stories

636
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
These were his

637
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,168
That's why they call me

638
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,704
Photocopy memory

639
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,776
Three months later ice was on the phone again

640
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,080
They say they got two thousand kisses now

641
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,920
Oh my God mm cases I was thin

642
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
Like a decade on that

643
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,272
Abyss could become slaves or us dumbest

644
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,856
Write Warren says at this point he was thinking

645
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
I just

646
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
Can't anymore

647
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,952
He started trying to avoid their phone call

648
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,512
And then something happened that really scary

649
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,328
He was sitting inside a small graduate student

650
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,144
When are the noise he didn't wreck

651
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
The phone call

652
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,752
It's from my old office phone

653
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
Snow White

654
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
Record

655
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,592
This is like an old

656
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,896
Office phone that never rings

657
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,944
I didn't even know that phone with walking

658
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,296
Lord says it was a Dusty rotary dial

659
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
Phone

660
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,112
He picked the phone up

661
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
Slowly

662
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,976
The person on the other end said he was calling from Ice

663
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,536
He also called Lawrence by his English name

664
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
The name he was trying to bury

665
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
Out in Arizona

666
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
Lawrence

667
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,144
Says

668
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
This

669
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Felt like

670
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
A message

671
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,472
A power play

672
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,288
Ice could have called him on his

673
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
Cell phone decor

674
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Emailed him

675
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
To him

676
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,408
This was the government saying

677
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,944
We can find you

678
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,224
Anywhere you are

679
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
That's really big brother

680
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,600
Festival 1984 the guy from Ice

681
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,392
So the government needed him

682
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
That's out time Iowa

683
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:44,352
So scared and I refuse I say no I couldn't help you I don't really want help you

684
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,144
Cuz he didn't want to spend decades on

685
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
On this because at this point

686
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,008
Investigation had moved into a new phase

687
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,544
And he knew that if he helped

688
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,592
It would mean destroying potentially

689
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Thousand

690
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
Supplies

691
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,688
During the prosecution Lawrence says

692
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,016
He was comfortable helping the government go after the industry

693
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:06,112
But in this new phase the government's going after the

694
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Science

695
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,440
And that just didn't sit right with

696
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,512
What are the two situations different to you

697
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
Those

698
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,584
Chinese immigrants.

699
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
Science

700
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
They even

701
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
Didn't know

702
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:22,752
They commit crimes were doing that their attorney just tell lie to them too

703
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
Do that

704
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:28,384
Well some of these clients knew very well that they were lying on their Asylum

705
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
Vacation

706
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:34,016
Yes they know. But what legal attorney promise you you will be fine

707
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,088
They couldn't really make right judgement

708
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,880
The way Lawrence tells it

709
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,440
The government is mixing up with his legal

710
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
With what is right

711
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,048
It made sense to him to go after the lawyers but

712
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,888
Clients were just doing what the lawyers told them to do he says

713
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:54,496
Lawrence wants no part in helping the government strip Asylum

714
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
From people who wanted years ago

715
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,104
Even if it means going into hiding

716
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
Forever

717
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,968
Do you really think that the federal government won't be able to find you now

718
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
I don't think so

719
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:10,880
But what are your plans I mean are you just going to keep running from Ice forever

720
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,208
What else I can do

721
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,280
And that is why he asked to go by Lauren

722
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:21,120
Send a story and is talking to us on Skype from an undisclosed

723
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Location

724
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:27,008
Immigration officials wouldn't confirm for us whether they really did try to

725
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,800
Paul Lawrence back into all these

726
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
Client case

727
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
So

728
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
We're telling boring side of the story

729
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,688
Even though we know he did lie

730
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
For a living

731
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,992
But in this case

732
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,528
His story checked out

733
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:44,672
The government was undertaking a massive review of client cases from operation fiction writer

734
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
And now

735
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,024
Lawrence's decision to disappear

736
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,816
Has left it to others

737
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,352
To wrestle with a broken aside

738
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
Alarm system

739
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,704
It's a system that was created after World War

740
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,800
And it was based on kind of a wistful ideal

741
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,896
That the government will protect people with true stories

742
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Stop suffering

743
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,504
But over the decades the question that's persisted is

744
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,088
How do we know when people are telling the truth

745
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:20,000
It's impossible to fact check every detail of the 20,000 some stories that went

746
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
Asylum every year

747
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,608
So this is a system that runs on hunches

748
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,448
The hunch of the lawyer who signed your Asylum application

749
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,240
Asylum officer or

750
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,800
Immigration judge who decides your claim is

751
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
Credible

752
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,384
Lawrence admits he took full advantage of this

753
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:40,992
And helps the vert the very system that gave him a chance to stay in the US

754
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
But he says

755
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,832
His decision to disappear now

756
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
How many people

757
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
And he's proud of

758
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,952
Last thing I do something great

759
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,024
I seem to make it much harder for eyes

760
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
2

761
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Deport

762
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,840
Thousands of people

763
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,936
But you were the one who helped

764
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,984
A lot of people

765
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,800
Write false things and their Asylum application

766
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,616
And that's why ice is going after them now

767
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,152
All right now

768
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
Without my help

769
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
Two eyes

770
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,552
I probably will make it much harder for ice to deport them and

771
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
They may have chance

772
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,648
To staying in the United States

773
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
They may

774
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:24,512
But we have learned that since 2014

775
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:28,096
Thousands of Asylum claims have been thrown into doubt

776
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:39,360
US citizenship and Immigration Services told us they are reviewing the Asylum cases of more than 3,000

777
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:44,224
500 former clients of all the lawyers convicted in operation fiction writer

778
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,576
They told us that if they don't scrutinize these old Asylum cases

779
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
The American people

780
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,440
Law-abiding asylum-seekers and the rule of law

781
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Suffer

782
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:59,584
There are also reviewing the Asylum case of every spouse and child

783
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
Those clients

784
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,912
Meaning these are people who just

785
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
Kind of inherited Asylum status

786
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,984
When their parent or

787
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,568
Their spouse years ago and that's how they were able to stay in the country

788
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,104
But they may not be able to anymore

789
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:15,456
So the total USCIS confirm to us is more than

790
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,504
13000 immigrants

791
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,576
Who are now facing possible deportation

792
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,672
Immigration lawyers told us that they have never seen Asylum cases

793
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,232
Systemically reviewed on a scale like this

794
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,536
Indices entire history

795
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
And one of those cases

796
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,840
Is Johnny

797
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
Remember her

798
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:36,192
She was the Asylum applicant who Lawrence had helped

799
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,728
Store we had heard earlier

800
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,032
In the fall of 2012

801
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,872
She had also help the government during operation fiction writer

802
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,992
And in return the government promised her they wouldn't prosecute her

803
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:53,856
And that in fact they would bring her cooperation to the attention of ice

804
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
If she wanted

805
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,696
But in 2016

806
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:01,024
Johnny Lee received a letter from the government that bread

807
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,424
Notice of intent to terminate Asylum status

808
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,240
Georgia.

809
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,288
I thought the government

810
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,568
Thomas me

811
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,128
My situation wouldn't get worse

812
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,664
If I help them

813
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,456
I helped them

814
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Good night

815
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,296
Why aren't they helping me

816
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
To hold your pee

817
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:29,696
So downtown the scene cooperated with the government

818
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:33,792
And now that cooperation is being used against her

819
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:40,448
Immigration officials got a hold of every self incriminating statement that she made while helping the FBI

820
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:45,824
And now they're using precisely those statements as the evidence to deport her

821
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,920
And not just her but also her husband who got Asylum status through her

822
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,736
When we were reporting this story

823
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:57,088
We can decide who to be angry with or who you feel sorry for

824
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,416
I mean how do we weigh the relative wrongs in the system

825
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,584
And then we heard Jenny say something it just kind of summed it all up for us if she'll shoot

826
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,960
Yes I did trick the government but in the end

827
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,496
The government

828
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
Tricked me back

829
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:23,200
This story would

830
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:29,600
Not have happened without Lauren hilgers her book Patriot number one American Dreams in Chinatown

831
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,672
Was what first got me thinking about chinatown's Asylum Disney

832
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:36,768
And special things to David custom down for being an early listener
