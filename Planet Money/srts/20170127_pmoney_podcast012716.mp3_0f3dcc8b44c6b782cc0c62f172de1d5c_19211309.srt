Alex goldmark

9
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:25,088
I want to talk for half a second about something that President Trump said in his inaugural

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,880
One by one

11
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,416
The factory shutter

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
And left our Shores

13
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,000
With not even

14
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,024
I thought

15
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,864
About the millions and millions of American workers

16
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,912
That were left behind

17
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,984
He even got kind of poetic at one point talking about

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,520
Rusted out factories

19
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,568
Scattered like tombstones

20
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,848
Across the landscape

21
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
Of our nation

22
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,688
And he's not totally wrong

23
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,992
But he's also not totally right

24
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,784
In parts of this country yes

25
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,368
Factories have been closing and Jobs been moving overseas for decade

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,672
But tree doesn't just take jobs

27
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,512
Any Economist will tell you trade makes the country better overall

28
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:08,864
American consumers get to buy cheaper goods and American companies sell more stuff over

29
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,680
And there is this idea that I

30
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:17,056
If you can just take just a little bit of the money from the people who are doing better be

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,128
And you can give it to the losers the workers

32
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
Interested outfit

33
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,968
Factory say then it should in theory make trade help

34
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,736
Everyone

35
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:30,624
And this is not just an idea this is an actual federal government program for laid-off worker

36
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
Been around since 1974

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,280
And here's how it works if you can prove that you lost your job to trade policy

38
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,560
The government is going to help

39
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
With money with cash

40
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:44,704
But they are also going to try and help you find a job in an industry that is not dying

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,008
It is called trade adjustment assistance

42
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,336
And it's like you have been adjusted out of a job we're going to

43
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
Assist you

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
Everyone just calls it ta

45
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,480
I wanted to see how ta Works in real life

46
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,112
So I went to Erie Pennsylvania which is a city that has lost a lot of jobs to trade lot of factories closed

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,976
VTA program is run out of this little job center in what used to be a strip mall.

48
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,256
Job centers called careers

49
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,328
Wednesday I was talking to people

50
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,632
It was really nice A little tense

51
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
I was going to go back the next day.

52
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,496
To talk some more people but I got a text message saying

53
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
No no don't come

54
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Because

55
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
Going to blow up Careerlink

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
They had a bomb threat

57
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,992
Executive director Rick Cornwell says

58
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,320
There were two phone calls made this morning a man threatening to open

59
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
Fire and Blood

60
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
What's up

61
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,696
Erie Police or the process of searching the building for any

62
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
Suspicious materials

63
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:44,864
Cornwell believes both phone calls came from the same man who they believe is a disgruntled client

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,424
People in Erie are so frustrated

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
That one of them at least

66
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Threaten to blow up a job site

67
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,152

Siri is way out in Northwest

82
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:54,752
Western Pennsylvania it's a long low City that set on the edge of Lake Erie

83
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,800
And Alex can I tell you something about Yuri

84
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
I've only been there once lay it on me

85
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
I loved

86
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
Erie Pennsylvania okay I love it

87
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,224
First thing is people who are from Erie Ray.

88
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
So hard

89
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
This one night I was going back to my hotel I got in a taxi

90
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
And the taxi driver took me to the wrong Hotel because he said my hotel was a crappy hotel and he wanted me to see

91
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,815
Erie had nicer places to stay so he was like TripAdvisor but

92
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
With veto power

93
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,167
Actually I did see one guy being rude

94
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,239
Was being condescending to a waitress at Applebee's

95
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
But then

96
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
He went back and he apologized

97
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:34,943
So even the one rude person turned out to be a nice person

98
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,223
But you were there to me

99
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
The workers who have lost their jobs

100
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
And we're part of this retraining

101
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
McFarland is one of those guys

102
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,183
He's 6 years old but he looks about 15 years younger

103
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,255
Just wearing work pants and work boots and Carhartt jacket

104
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,559
And he had this amazing T-shirt with a

105
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
Tiger airbrushed on it and the tiger is a

106
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
Drinking from a stream

107
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
Favorite surgery

108
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
Just one of many

109
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031
Mick worked at General Electric for 8 years

110
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,591
GE has big plant in Erie they make locomotives

111
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,895
Mick was a it was a crane operator

112
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
I'm in last year GE laid off

113
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
1500 people

114
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,575
Just to give you a sense of a scale Erie only has a hundred thousand residents

115
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:17,183
Nick was on the shop floor working and he says his bosses came down and had him something

116
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
Make of this piece of paper saying it

117
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
Where rent being laid off

118
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,607
What is the piece of paper say it does it just say sorry you're fired

119
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
No sorry you're unemployed

120
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,495
Make it been in manufacturing since he was 25

121
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
Before that he was a car

122
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
He's been watching the jobs

123
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,151
Even doing what I can but when he gets that piece of paper

124
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
He knows his life

125
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
And then he gets invited to the meeting

126
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575
Can the other laid-off workers are told

127
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,415
Come on out we're going to set you down for a seminar and at seminars run by this

128
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
Tell me what's your name

129
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
Joe Miceli

130
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,279
Spell your last name for me

131
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Eli

132
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,423
Joe is the program supervisor for workplace

133
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,471
Programs that is his fancy title

134
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
They're at the job center in Erie

135
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
And he works directly with a lot of pee

136
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
People who lost their job

137
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
So he knows your name

138
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
Faces

139
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,943
And when there's a big layoff like the one at GE

140
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,759
Joe he's like the first line his first move

141
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
Is to tell the workers

142
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,343
But there is this thing called trade adjustment

143
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:23,743
So in the case of GE they bring in hundreds of people as many as will fit into the Local Union Hall

144
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
It's a big room like a courtroom it's got a lot of folding chairs

145
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,143
And there's this enormous mural on the back wall it's like

146
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
100 Years of Union history

147
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,519
New Joe is it a large guy he's a quiet guy

148
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,311
And now he's got to get up in front of

149
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,615
500 angry worried

150
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
About to be laid off

151
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
And this whole noise fills the hole

152
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Realm it really

153
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
Steelers division

154
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,343
That many people moving talking and doing everything

155
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Thing at once

156
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,695
3 super careful about everything right down to what he's wearing

157
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
In this case jeans

158
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
You can't dress up too much you're not a suit

159
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
You don't come into the room

160
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Layoff union workers

161
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,191
Blue collar workers of America

162
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,983
Wearing a suit telling them the Third

163
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
Going to lose benefits

164
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Naoto

165
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
Time makes you look like a suit

166
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
Absolutely

167
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
You're one of the workers you're with them

168
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,015
He gets up on stage clears his throat to get everyone's attention

169
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,367
And all those 300-500 faces first look at you

170
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,183
The responsibility hits you

171
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
He starts by acknowledging this

172
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
Really suck

173
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
You are a victim of the global economy

174
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
But he says

175
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
Here's some good news

176
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
Kind of

177
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
He gives everyone a Blue Book

178
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,263
What is a copy of the trade adjustment assistance Act

179
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
And he explains

180
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,591
Because your job has been lost to trade

181
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,639
You get to take advantage of these benefit

182
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
You might not feel lucky but you're pretty lucky

183
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
Does boss has a way of describing this

184
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
And you should just hear it directly from

185
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,623
This is the what we call the Cadillac of all training program

186
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,231
This is Ruben paasche he oversees with substrate act training in Pennsylvania

187
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
He knows the benefits

188
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
Inside and out he's been

189
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
Years

190
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Explaining them to pee

191
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
And you will tell people

192
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
If you qualify for TAA

193
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,703
The federal government will pay in full

194
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
For your schooling for up to

195
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
Two and a half

196
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
Trade school Community College

197
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
Wherever you want to go

198
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
As long as you are in school

199
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
Or retraining

200
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
You'll get a check in the

201
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,015
It's like an unemployment check but it doesn't cut off until you are retrain for a new

202
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Do you want to retrain

203
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,111
On the job then the government will pay for

204
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Do you have an apprentice

205
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,439
You also get some money to go looking for work

206
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,791
Bill pay for gas and food and lodging as long as you're on the road looking for a job

207
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
And here's a big one

208
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
If you're willing to leave Erie

209
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
If you can get a job outside

210
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,471
The city federal government will pay for you to move

211
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
Anywhere in the US

212
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Keith Urban

213
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,847
So far during my tenure the further sleeve

214
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
Relocated some would-be Puerto Rico

215
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
They weren't they got a job as a biologist

216
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Really yeah

217
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
Bilingual so that helped him a lot

218
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,623
And the company hired in Puerto Rico so we relocated his family

219
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
To Puerto Rico

220
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,207
These are the kinds of stories the Joe and Ruben towel at the

221
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
The meeting in the U

222
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,791
And when they're done and they finished their spiel

223
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,351
All the workers they start rushing over and they say

224
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,399
When do my unemployment checks start coming in

225
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
When do I have to register for school by

226
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
Andrew banjo they tell him

227
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
Come on down to the job center

228
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
That's what we will help you figure out why

229
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
What you're going to do for the

230
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,943
And once they're there someone like Ruben sits down with him

231
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,247
Pulls up a list of jobs and says

232
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,807
These are the ones we think are not going to go away

233
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
We have a list

234
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
The high-priority occupations that

235
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
With the case manager

236
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:36,255
The worker can review and see if the occupation that I want

237
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
I'm able to get a job after

238
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,631
So if I'm looking at that list and and ice

239
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
Say I want to be an x-ray technician

240
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,263
They're going to look in this hole yet x-ray technician is right up at the top

241
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
If I tell them I want to be

242
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
A trapeze artist

243
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,455
They're going to look a trapeze artist is not on there we are not going to pay for you to train

244
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
And the way we would show that just

245
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
It's just that we're not

246
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,647
I'm stepping over a person's dream is let's look at the labor market information in your area

247
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,231
And the labor market information in in your specific area

248
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,279
How many trapeze

249
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,327
Jumpers are there how many jobs are available

250
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
And because there aren't any

251
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
Let's look at something. Perhaps

252
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
May interest you a bit

253
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,311
You like nudgent or an x-ray technician look at look at that one

254
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,127
The little like being on a trapeze

255
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Play exactly

256
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,711
And this all cost more money

257
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
In a regular

258
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,343
Program to show a company has to prove that they're laid off workers deserve

259
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,951
The Department of Labor it makes the company apply and prove to the government that yes

260
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
These jobs were lost because of trade

261
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
Not a recession not bad management but

262
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Trade

263
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
And 6 in 10 companies that apply

264
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
Don't get it

265
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,727
But in this case GE for this Factory

266
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
They applied

267
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Bay Path

268
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,335
And so making his co-workers they're going to get ta

269
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,407
And they are headed to retraining for one of those new jobs on

270
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Which means

271
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Back to school

272
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:05,087
Here's the thing about colleges and technical schools they want your records They want your transcripts

273
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,415
A lot of these people have been out of school for a long time

274
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Can I have kids

275
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:15,071
Joe Miceli was telling me about this one woman she got laid off from GE she decided to take advantage of the benefits

276
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,423
Chico's to apply to different schools in the first thing that they want

277
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
Has her high school transcripts

278
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
Well she went to a small

279
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
Private high school

280
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Pittsburgh

281
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
What you sense

282
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
Close down and burned down

283
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
Sexy

284
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,063
She's very persistent she

285
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
She gets on Facebook

286
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
And she finds a teacher

287
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
And from the teachers

288
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
She finds the director

289
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,047
And the director is now a 92 year old man in nursing home

290
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
And she calls him on the phone and he remembers her

291
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
Did you get a transcript

292
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,703
She still can't get

293
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Trask

294
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,383
I went back and I checked in with Joe about her she never did find her transcripts so she picked a different training program

295
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,735
Okay but hopefully she is an outlier and most people our age

296
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,087
Yes they enroll in schools like the Erie Institute

297
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
222 technology

298
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,183
I took a drive down there one night to meet with McFarland

299
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
The guy with the the Great Tiger t-shirt

300
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,607
To the schools in another strip mall it was dark out it's raining a little bit

301
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
And when I got inside

302
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,983
Classic just let out and all these people flooded into the Halls

303
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
It was so weird

304
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
Because it's a

305
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
Technical School

306
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,383
And so I was expecting young guys and then there was you then

307
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
But most of them were grown men

308
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
And not just grown men

309
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
They were old man

310
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,087
So I grabbed making two of his friends would also been laid off from GE

311
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,159
Is there a room we can borrow for just a couple minutes

312
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,743
And then we will bounce out with that one

313
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:54,143
All three of these guys are retraining in HVAC heating ventilation and air conditioning

314
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
And you know HVAC is not simple

315
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
What thermodynamic

316
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,567
You have to understand how pressure affects temperature

317
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,383
You have to tell what's inside of a closed system

318
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
It's solid science

319
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
Gnomic es6

320
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,271
And he has not taken a science test in 40 years

321
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
So sometimes when he's in class he

322
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,439
He thinks about that meeting in the union hall where they explain the benefits and they tell you about the retraining

323
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:23,583
Any thinks about one of the other workers who raised his hand and then said basically what Mick had been think

324
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,167
I believe he said he was 63 or 63 and a half

325
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
And said that

326
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,263
He just wanted to get his unemployment

327
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,615
Not have expensive going to school or spend time in school which

328
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
Was my thoughts also

329
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
59

330
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:43,295
Yes 59 and I knew if it by this time when I had to start school I'd be 60

331
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,135
And they told us we were not allowed to do that to get the benefit

332
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
We had to come to school

333
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
So it's costing the federal government

334
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
The cost of our school

335
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
To be here

336
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
Some of us don't want it

337
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
But this program is

338
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
Specifically designed not to be true

339
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,751
It is designed to give them their best shot at a new and better job

340
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,567
But then in the classroom these guys are telling me

341
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
They are sitting next

342
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
To Austin

343
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
Everybody wanted to talk about Austin

344
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
Because Austin is not on TAA

345
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
Austin

346
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
Is going to be 20 next month

347
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
Cheers mix friend Greg

348
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,927
You guys have a look at the 20 year olds like out of the side of your eye and thank

349
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Good company

350
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
Kitchen

351
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
I feel sorry for

352
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,583
Why because when I was 20 years old

353
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
I had a good job I could

354
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,447
I could sustain a house with a family

355
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,239
These young kids today

356
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
In Erie they don't have a chance they don't have a chance

357
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
What's the start I don't

358
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
I feel bad

359
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
But let's be real

360
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:45,759
After they all graduate unless someone in this equation is willing to leave Erie

361
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,575
You guys are going to be competing with Austin for jobs

362
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
An ed is 50

363
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,671
3 and make a 60 and Greg at 6

364
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
U2

365
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,743
You can tell that they have all done this math

366
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Sears Michigan

367
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
Do you expect to get a job in HVAC

368
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
That's my goal

369
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
Because that's part of

370
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
Retraining

371
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Is you have to have a goal

372
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
You're smiling a little bit

373
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
Like you don't really believe it though

374
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
Well

375
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,127
I'm going to be 61 years old

376
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,943
How many people are going to hire me at 61

377
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,039
If they want to keep collecting unemployment they need to be in class

378
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Basketball

379
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
So they come to

380
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,647
They work hard and they count on those checks

381
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,695
But as if things weren't

382
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Hard enough

383
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:32,095
Pennsylvania cut 500 workers from the Department that runs the TAA program

384
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
The unemployment checks

385
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
They're not going out

386
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Four five

387
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
6 weeks later

388
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:42,335
And now the job center in Erie is swamped with people who want to know where is my money

389
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,383
So these guys just keep calling

390
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,687
Mixed friend Ed forget should be here

391
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
His phone

392
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,503
Whoa on January 10th

393
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
You call that number 54 time

394
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
Are you getting through

395
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Busy signal

396
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
Utility companies calling me

397
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,535
Market my mortgage company I don't have money to pay my mortgage

398
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
I really don't

399
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,863
No I have to call him tomorrow and make arrangements

400
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
Cuz I have no money to pay it

401
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
So here's where we're at

402
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
No job

403
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
No money

404
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
No one to call about it

405
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,871
And no idea what you're going to be doing in 12 to 18 months

406
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,943
This benefit program was supposed to mitigate some of that

407
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,759
But it's like these guys are feeling it more than ever

408
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,575
Maybe you can see how someone might break down

409
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Which

410
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
Brings us back to

411
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
Whatever happened to that bomb threat

412
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,303
Well they told me not to go down there so the first thing I did was to go down there

413
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
Because you're a reporter right exactly

414
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:40,191
So by the time I got there I everyone had been evacuated

415
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:44,543
Place was empty there was just a little sign on the door that said you please come back tomorrow

416
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
And that's

417
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,151
Basically what it feels like to go through this program

418
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
And this is the best that we can do for people who have lost their jobs to trade yes right now it's the best Federal program

419
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,671
One solution could be to just make ta a way bigger

420
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:05,791
To offer to way more people to make it easier for more companies to get on ta

421
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
You got a lot more money

422
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,887
Another idea is to just

423
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Stop

424
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
To say

425
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
This idea doesn't work we can't take

426
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,799
A little bit of the money from the people who benefit from trade

427
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,103
Give it to the losers and have everybody better off

428
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,943
Yeah and this in a way is the Donald Trump

429
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,759
Kamp-rite he thinks trade itself is the problem

430
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
He wants to fight trade

431
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,367
So he's throwing up the trans-pacific trade agreement

432
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
He's rethinking master

433
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,487
And all of this is supposed to help people like making his friends

434
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,095
Of course when you talk to Economist they say hold on no it is not that simple

435
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,167
Most of the jobs done by people like micosay

436
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
They aren't going to Farhan

437
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
They're just

438
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
Vanishing

439
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,311
As factories get more automated

440
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,615
Or they move within the US

441
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
So for instance

442
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:57,247
GE built a brand new plant in Fort Worth Texas where there is no Union

443
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
So there's lower pay

444
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,111
And to Erie Pennsylvania like its workers

445
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
Is going to have to reinvent itself

446
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,463
With TAA or without TAA

447
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,023
You just can't fight the world economy

448
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:25,663
If you work at a place that is being changed because of trade or is getting ready to change because of

449
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
Say after changing

450
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,015
