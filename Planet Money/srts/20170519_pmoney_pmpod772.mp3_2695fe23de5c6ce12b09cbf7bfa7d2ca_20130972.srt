A problem isn't too much

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552

It's called the rise and fall of American growth

00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,960
Cox overfire Longway bringing the Apple

Clothes from one town to another town where do you have to go to the bathroom

90

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
Popcorn says imagine that delivery

00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
Lays down under

99
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
Falls asleep

100
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
For hundreds of you

101
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
He wakes up

102
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,071
He's in the United States

103
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
The 1800

104
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
She gets up

105
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
He looks around

106
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
NEC the world that looks

107
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
Like

108
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Not that differ

109
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
From the world he fell asleep

110
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
Yeah they're still horses

00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,895
Cuz I'm cards he still walking along way cooking over a fire poop in a hole in the ground

112
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,967
So you know hundreds of years apart

113
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
And

114
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
Not that much has changed

115
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,063
Because

116
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
1800 or so

117
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,695
Things did not change that much from year to year or even from

118
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
Century to Century

119
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
Now thought experiment part 2

120
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
Same delivery guy

121
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839

122
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887

123
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
470 years

124
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
Short by his

125
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
Wakes up in 19 for

126
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Princess

127
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
She wakes up in a world that is

128
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
Wheatley transfer

129
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
They would

130
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
Not

131
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
Believe

132
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
That you could pick up

133
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
An instrument

134
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
And talk to somebody

135
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,343
A hundred or a thousand miles away

136
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
On

137
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
The telephone

138
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,183
They wouldn't know that too

139
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
Illuminate a room

140
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
You could turn a switch

141
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
They would

142
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
B flabbergast

143
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
To look up at the sky

144
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
And see

145
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
Objects

146
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
Flying in the sky

147
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
So which

148
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,007
No more pooping in holes in the ground right now there are

149
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,407
Flush toilets there are cars driving around everywhere our guy even has a truck after hundreds of years of a horses

150
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,991
Kitchen

151
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
Teaching is like a thing right now there's a

152
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855
Refrigerator which is never no more

153
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
And if you go to City lookup

154
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,975
And they're just like these ridiculous impossibly tall bill

155
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
The person who

156
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,559
Went to sleep in 1870 would have been

157
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
Completely

158
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
Astonished

159
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,143
How to go to New York City

160
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
Ride a Subway

161
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,471
Come out of the subway in gaze up

162
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
Add buildings that

163
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
We're already

164
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
A 75

165
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
Or even a hundred stories tall and then

166
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
Quesadilla

167
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,199
Empire State Building which was built in 90

168
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
1031

169
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,111
The man knows every single date for everyone

170
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,927
Anybody it's for a point he has a point

171
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
And the point of this whole thought

172
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Experiment

173
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
Sleep

174
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
Waking up going to sleep waking up

175
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
What is this

176
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
For hundreds of years

177
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
Hardly any change at all

178
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
And then

179
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,215
You miss one lifetime

180
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
Just this one single span

181
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
Everything came

182
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
There is just as complete transformation

183
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Extraordinary

184
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
How much

185
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
How fast at this

186
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,503
And most of those changes grow out of

187
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
Two key things

188
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Number one

189
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,599
Electricity

190
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
And number two

191
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
The internal combustion engine

192
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
So like what today is it's a regular rolled

193
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
Dakotaz called called things like

194
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
Electricity

195
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
The internal combustion

196
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
They called them

197
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
General-purpose technology

198
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
And the basic ideas

199
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
These Technologies

200
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
That you all kinds of different things

201
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
All across the

202
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:14,687
So you see that in this in this 1870 to 1940. You see them transforming sort of

203
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Daily life

204
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:21,087
But they are not done yet electricity and the internal combustion engine they still got more to give

205
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:25,439
Bob Gordon says in the in the next period in the middle of the 20th century

206
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,743
They transformed the way we work

207
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,815
They make work much more efficient they let workers

208
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
Is do a lot more

209
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
He said you really see this starting right around World War

210
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,007
The famous Willow Run plant that was built by Henry Ford

211
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,311
They were producing one bomber an hour

212
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
By 1944 and 45

213
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,687
Bomber airplane in 1 hour

214
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,503
They were course making a number of them

215
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,879
They work but coming out the end of the factory door was one bomber an hour

216
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
Extraordinary

217
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
After the war

218
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
American workers

219
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
Keep getting more and more productive

220
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
The government building

221
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:08,447
Highway that makes truck drivers more efficient but it also means lots of other kinds of Industries get more efficient cuz they can you know me

222
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
Move all their stuff around from one place

223
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,287
Another Gordon says around the same time

224
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
Electricity gives us another big

225
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Breakthrough

226
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
This one's more surprising

227
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Air condition

228
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,223
Air conditioning created again

229
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Enormous

230
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,807
Improvement in productivity predictably for off

231
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Office workers

232
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
I trapped inside in the summer

233
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,951
And do you see like when air conditioning gets too

234
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
A sector in Officer town

235
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
That workers actually do

236
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Do more

237
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
Yes there

238
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,375
There are studies that

239
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
Show distinct Improvement

240
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
All across the economy year after year

241
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Productivity

242
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
Is going up

243
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
And not just anecdotal

244
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
The government Ashley

245
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
Track productivity

246
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,967
Trax how much value and average worker is creating a

247
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Hour of work

248
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
And this number productivity productivity growth

249
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,391
Doesn't that you know recorded much in the Press people don't talk about it much

250
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
But Economist Arabic

251
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
Seth

252
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
Because in the long run

253
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,839
Productivity growth is the way society as a whole gets better off

254
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,447
You know productivity growth is the reason that people in the 50s

255
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
These are doing so much better than their grandpa

256
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,335
Tractors with internal combustion engines replaced horses

257
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
Food. Moore

258
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
Builders started using electric

259
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,455
Power tools instead of hand tools

260
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,527
An ordinary people could afford bigger more comfortable houses

261
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
Seema Mehta work

262
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
More and better stuff

263
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
Productivity growth

264
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
Trucking along in the 50s and 60s

265
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,719
It slows down in the seventies and eighties

266
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
And then

267
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
Get another

268
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
YouTube

269
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
In the 90s

270
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
From

271
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,679
Computers and internet

272
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:50,335
M computers they are a new general purpose technology

273
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,127
She that does all kinds of different things

274
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
All these different facets

275
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
And so in the 90s

276
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
Businesses are going online.

277
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
Replacing paper with

278
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Computers

279
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:04,927
Workers are getting much more productive even after the.com bust into the early years of the 21st Century

280
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
Productivity is growing really fast

281
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
But then

282
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
In 2004

283
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Something goes

284
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
Productivity growth

285
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
Comes crashing

286
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,519
Did not play you know in the popular press as a disaster

287
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,615
You know it's like that moment in the movies where the

288
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
Recite one dog that just starts

289
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
Starts barking at Anna

290
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
He's trying to tell us something

291
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
What is it boy

292
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
Productivity growth

293
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
So I kind of soda

294
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,719
It was maybe a temporary thing and then we had the Great Recession than I expected that ass the recovery proceeded

295
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,815
That we would begin to get productivity of picking up again

296
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:47,167
This is Martin Bailey he was the chairman of President Clinton's Council of economic advisers

297
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471
And he has been studying productivity for a long time

298
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:55,615
So that when I looked at you know 2010-11 12 13 14

299
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,759
1516 and it still wasn't picking up that's when I began to get really nervous

300
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,063
So you're nervous now if it goes through

301
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
60 that means you're nervous right now

302
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
I know it's right now yeah

303
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,511
In the last few years we have heard a lot about the rise of in a koala

304
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,583
The idea that the economic pie is not being divided

305
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
And of course that is important

306
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
But Bailey and other economist

307
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,007
We also need to figure out this other thing

308
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
We also need to figure out

309
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
Why is the pi barely growing at all

310
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
Why is productivity growth

311
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
They come up with a name for this

312
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,015
They call it the productivity paradox

313
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
And this is what the productivity paradox

314
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,647
We have all of this amazing technology

315
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719
Robots artificial intelligence the cloud

316
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,559
And it should be making us more productive that's what technology does

317
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
But

318
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,143
When you look at the numbers for the economy of a

319
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,495
All that technology does not seem to be making a difference

320
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
It does not seem to be making us more productive

321
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
I do hear that and you say

322
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,991
There is no way that can possibly be true right it seem so impossible which is why they call it a parrot

323
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
That's the paradox

324
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
And there are few different

325
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
Part of it

326
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Party with cardi

327
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
Maybe we are getting more

328
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
We're just not measuring

329
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
You know it's easier to measure

330
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
A productivity output per worker per hour

331
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,167
When people are saying making cars but today there's lots more people working in hospital

332
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
How do you measure the productivity of a Hosta

333
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:31,359
Even if you account for that Economist say it really looks like productivity is

334
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,663
Still growing much more slowly than at you

335
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
They say

336
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
Listen

337
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,039
It doesn't feel true but trust us when we do the numbers that's what we

338
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
Robert Gordon thinks he knows what's going on

339
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,511
And his explanation it goes back to the delivery guy who fell asleep in 1870 and woke up in 1940 and the world

340
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
I totally change

341
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
Princess

342
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
Do another thought

343
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
Compare that

344
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,167
The somebody who fell asleep in 1950

345
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
And woke up to

346
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
Today for the person who woke up to

347
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
What would have seen do

348
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
To the

349
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
1954

350
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
Would be everything to do with computers

351
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,455
Course computers a huge deal laptops

352
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
IPhones are everywhere all the magic that comes with

353
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
But then

354
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,855
Gordon says think about everything else

355
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
Think about just like a normal house

356
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,743
Remember that person went to sleep in 1870 and woke up in 90

357
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,559
40 they were shocked to see houses that had

358
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,119
Running water and Refrigeration

359
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
The

360
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,239
Person going to sleep in 1950 and waking up today with only find one

361
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,287
Element of the kitchen which is new

362
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
And that is the microwave oven

363
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,687
That's a great person for 1950

364
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
Listening as today

365
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
We find her car is entirely familiar

366
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
Guitar delivery guy

367
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
Went to sleep with the truck

368
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
Wakes up with another truck

369
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
Maybe

370
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,975
GPS now but remember last time

371
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
That truck

372
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
Replaced his

373
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Horse-drawn carts

374
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
Last time we went to sleep

375
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
New York City had streets full of horses

376
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
The tallest building with a church

377
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
He woke up to Subways in skyscraper

378
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:07,871
This time just the same subway system is existed in Empire State Building Rising above

379
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
Everything else

380
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
And yes he says

381
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,759
Shirt the new World Trade Center is a little taller than the Empire State

382
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,087
But it's like with the car it's just an incremental change

383
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
It's not some big revolution

384
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,183
More of the same rather than something new

385
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
Gordon says

386
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,791
The world just has not changed as much in the past

387
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,351
70 years as it did in the seven years before that

388
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,447
Those big 20th century changes driven by electricity

389
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
The internal combustion engine

390
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Those were just

391
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
A much bigger deal than the changes

392
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
That have been driven by computers

393
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:44,735
Gordon says computers and the internet they did give us that amazing decade in the late 90s and early aughts that was when

394
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,527
You know most people got the internet

395
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,599
Google came along it was when smartphones came along

396
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,415
We had all that already you know 10:12

397
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
Since then criticize

398
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Not that much has changed

399
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
But the iPhone

400
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,887
Yes one of the peculiar aspects of the

401
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,447
Last 10 years is that so much

402
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,775
Innovation is gone into the iPhone and all the associated app

403
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,615
In fact the record for productivity growth in the last 6 years

404
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,687
Is about as low as has been in US recorded history

405
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,039
Has it ever been as far as We Know

406
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
My coming at this from the outside

407
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
I really

408
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
Do find it shocking

409
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,255
That's because the main ways in which computers

410
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,095
Raise business productivity had already happened by 10 years ago

411
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
And the

412
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
Nature of the iPhone

413
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
With most of its uses

414
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
Is in

415
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
Your personal space

416
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,639
So sure iPhones are a huge deal in our personal lives

417
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,991
But they haven't really fundamentally changed the way that most of us do our work

418
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,295
And other Technologies

419
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
Robots

420
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
Artificial intelligence

421
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
Because they haven't changed work that much either

422
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
I play a game called find the robot

423
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
Everywhere in my life

424
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,535
When I travel I get on the airplane I

425
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,423
I go into a hotel I see human beings do the same thing that they did to 10 or 15 years ago

426
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,263
Ian office situations going to the doctor the dentist the veterinarian

427
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,079
Going into retail stores going into restaurants

428
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,895
I see a large part of the economy that operating in the

429
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,711
The same way as it did last year and the year before

430
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,039
Princess this isn't just his little game of spots

431
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,367
He says the numbers for the economy as a whole back

432
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,743
If in fact robots and computers were replacing humans in vast numbers

433
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,303
All those machines would lead to lots more out

434
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,119
And there would be fewer hours of human labor

435
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
So productivity would be going up

436
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Really fast

437
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
But it's not

438
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Productivity is barely going up

439
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
Also

440
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,591
If robots and computers were

441
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
Taking our jobs overnight

442
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,175
The number of jobs would be declining

443
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
But that's not what's happening

444
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,551
The economy has been adding millions of jobs for year

445
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
Year after year

446
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,391
I tend to look at myself as a jobs Optima

447
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
I even if I maybe

448
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
A techno pessimist

449
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,815
Okay so that's Robert Gordon story of the last

450
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
150 years

451
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
Also the last 10 years

452
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,423
Obvious questions

453
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
We'll have that in a minute

454
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Don't touch that dial

455
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:22,687
And by dial I mean be globally connected supercomputer in your pocket

456
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:29,087

Inspire to build

462
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,495
Gordon thinks about the future

463
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
He thinks that the next 10 years

464
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
They're going to look a lot like the last 10 years

465
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,663
Sort of incremental changes things get better slowly

466
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,199
But no big

467
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
We weren't book came out last

468
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,831
Steer this part his his claims about the future

469
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,415
That was what I think the most people should have quarreled with

470
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
We are smart and Bailey about

471
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,767
Does he smoke Economist who is nervous about the Prado

472
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,863
Robert Gordon has been fairly consistently pessimistic

473
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
About

474
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
Productivity growth

475
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,215
And so far he's been proven right

476
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,775
Is it going to be right in the future

477
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
It doesn't look like it

478
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
Because it looks as if

479
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,919
That technology Willy is moving ahead

480
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
You know

481
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,063
We're at the end of the show here I like I'll have to say I love

482
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,135
Love Gordon thought experiment about the guy falling asleep

483
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
It really

484
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
I think

485
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,231
It really is a lovely way to think about technology

486
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,791
Change anything oh we're not so special right now

487
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,191
But when it comes to the future I mean it feels to me and to Bailey and too many of the people who I talk to

488
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
My coordinate probably is not right

489
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,287
Feels like things really are about to change

490
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
Denise big

491
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:59,455
I don't know I hear people talk about things being about to change in these hugely profound ways

492
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
But

493
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,783
That always a kind of sounds like a V

494
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
Dream to me

495
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
And then I think about Robert Gordon who is

496
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Just like

497
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
Down there in the

498
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,255
Dirt with all the details and every single date

499
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
Everyday

500
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
And what he saying is

501
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
If you take the Long View

502
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
You will see that

503
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
Slow incremental change

504
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
Is normal

505
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,055
We had a thousand years of just

506
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Horses and cooking

507
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
Fires

508
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,407
And then we have is really strange time

509
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
Past couple hundred years or so

510
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
When things change very quick

511
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
And now

512
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
Maybe we're about to the way things have always been

513
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,647
To another era where change is slow

514
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,695
Not a horse to a car

515
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
Just an iPhone

516
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
To a better iPhone

517
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:58,847
Everyone at that we talked to you about the premise of the show

518
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
What argue with us about the show

519
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,783

Car show today was produced by Nick Fountain Bryant urstadt and Alex goldmark are the two people in charge of productivity

522
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:21,119
Free games of Planet Money special thanks to Joe machir Dale Jorgenson and John furnald all of them

523
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:26,495
Talk to me at Great length about productivity and Technology

524
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:30,591
She gave up the idea for the show if you're looking for something else to listen to

525
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,431
And you have kids and you want to listen to something with your kids

526
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
Got you newspaper

527
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:41,855
NPR just launched a new podcast for tip it's from Gyros who is great the show

528
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
It's called wow in the world I'm very excited to see her with my own children again is called wow in the world you can find it on NPR one

529
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,839
