1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,048
What are the reasons why I went into

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:03,840
Why a lot of people going to

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:04,608
Reporting

4
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,144
Is it weird reporters

5
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,168
Have short

6
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,264
We throw ourselves into a new thing we learned all about it

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,544
We tell her audience about it

8
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,848
And then we just move on to the next

9
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
Interesting thing

10
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,664
Sore feels like being at the state

11
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:24,320
I want a donut burger but I want the burger patties to be the bun and the donut in the middle

12
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,880
As you may remember Planet Money was obsessed

13
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,928
Put the state fair for about a hot minute

14
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,720
Then we went down a rabbit hole on

15
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,024
Tax policy no-wake Puerto Rican by

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,864
And then all the sudden we dropped everything to launch rocket

17
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,472
It is fun but it's also exhausting

18
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,824
And so at the end of every year we here at Planet Money like to stop for a moment

19
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,896
To think about the stories that we've done over the last 12 months

20
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
Reflect

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,944
On what they meant

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,784
And figure out what happened to the people we interviewed after we turned off the microphone

23
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:01,440
And went to go watch a rocket launch

24
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:14,240
Put on welcome to Planet Money on Robert Smith today on the show our annual year-end tradition

25
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
It is a show that we named after the catch phrase of my favorite old-timey radio reporter Paul Harvey used

26
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,176
USA Today

27
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
Together

28
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,992
You and I are going to learn

29
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
The rest of the story

30
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
That's what we call this podcast the rest of the story 2017 will check in on Vladimir Putin

31
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:38,816
Least favorite person in the world will travel back to a small town in the bayous of Louisiana

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,400
And we have a funeral for an algorithmic trading bot

33
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,288

00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,728
Let's begin with one of the more dramatic podcast

42
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
That we did in 2000

43
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,056
It was about a man named Bill Browder

44
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,128
Brother had an investment firm in Russia after

45
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
The collapse of communism

46
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,736
In a podcast called the story of how Browder angered Vladimir

47
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
El Prado

48
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Kicked out of Russia

49
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
His company taken away

50
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
And how his lawyer

51
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
What detained

52
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Tortured

53
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
And murdered by Russian authorities

54
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,280
Elsa Chang with my co-host on the story house of Robert

55
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,608
The Russian Warriors name was Sarah gay magnets

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,936
And Bill Browder has been trying to see Justice

57
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
First air date

58
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
By helping to pass a law in the U

59
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
Call the magnitsky

60
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
Basically what the actor

61
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
Is it freezes the assets

62
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,664
Human rights violators like the ones responsible

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Staircase murder

64
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
So that's what we left

65
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
The story when we did the podcast this summer

66
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
Since then

67
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
Thunder weirder right

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
It has

69
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
IU medical bill Browder last

70
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,488
He told me he had been traveling the world

71
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,536
Trying to persuade different countries

72
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,096
Passed their own versions of the magnitsky ACT

73
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
Human rights violators everywhere

74
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,192
And everything

75
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,008
I came to a head in mid-october

76
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
When Canada

77
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
Passed its own version of the magnets

78
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,712
Just days after that happened router tried to board a flight from London where he lives

79
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
To New York

80
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
When he was checking in the airline

81
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
Would not issue

82
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
Him a boarding pass

83
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
He discovered

84
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
His US Visa was

85
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:48,352
Revoked at about point I I call up a friend who works in law enforcement and I say could you

86
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Find out

87
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
If I'm on the Interpol

88
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
And sure enough

89
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
On the same day

90
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,544
That the magnitsky Act was passed in Canada

91
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
The Russians

92
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Added me

93
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
To the Interpol most wanted list

94
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
For the fifth time

95
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
So what about the Russians can just

96
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
Add somebody to the

97
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
List

98
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,856
Apparently I'm just extremely quickly in a pool

99
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
Is this organization

100
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
That is used all around the world

101
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
Help countries

102
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Find

103
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
Fugitives from the law

104
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
But the problem is

105
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,679
Not all the countries that belong to Interpol put people on the list with the most noble

106
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
Recently can get very political and there's no robust

107
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
Vetting process to figure out

108
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
Which people actually deserved

109
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
Beyond this most wanted list

110
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
What was the Russians

111
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
Justification

112
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,223
For even asking for

113
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
Well the past few times it is always been some form of

114
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
Tax evasion

115
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,951
But this time around daughter says the Russians really upped

116
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,535
The anti so they now accuse me of being a serial killer

117
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:55,935
A serial killer those are words that actually appear in a document somewhere here in a document from the Russian State investigative committee

118
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,519
80 which is their version of the FBI they're accusing me of being a serial killer

119
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
And who are the victims you have allegedly

120
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,663
Are there people who are involved in the criminal group that that some

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
Kilt Sergei magnitsky who died

122
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
On on there

123
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
That's part of their criminal group

124
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,599
Do they also realize that you killed Saturday

125
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
They have been wedge

126
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
But I killed star game

127
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
What is the theory

128
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
Or why and how

129
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
You killed are Damon

130
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,095
Magnitsky according to their justification

131
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,703
I killed Sergei magnitsky so then I could get a magnitsky Act passed in the United States

132
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Discredit Russia

133
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
That's there

134
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
After official explanation

135
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,871
Their explanations you went to the trouble of murdering someone so you could use his name

136
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
For a piece of legislation

137
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,431
Against Russia

138
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,039
And and and by the way in and I did this apparently

139
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
I'm from my home in London

140
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
Sodus Point

141
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,695
The Russians have accused him of tax evasion and being a serial killer

142
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
What else

143
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
What happened

144
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,631
So I've been accused of Serial killing I've been accused of

145
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
Stargate magnitsky

146
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,239
I've been accused of being an MI5

147
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,079
CIA agent transit to destabilize Russia

148
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:11,455
I've been accused of stealing 4.8 billion dollars of IMF money that was destined for Russia

149
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
I got 25 years ago

150
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
Tax evasion fraud false bankruptcy

151
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
And is that those are things I've seen the documents on

152
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,951
So that there's literally like 250 people

153
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
Working inside law enforcement agencies of Russia

154
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
On cases against me

155
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
So

156
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
Obviously just got cleared up

157
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
Because he

158
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
He was in that state to talk to him

159
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
Yeah that's right a couple of senators intervened and brought us because it was immediately reinstated and he got taken off the Interpol

160
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
List a few days after that

161
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
So what is Bill Browder

162
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
Doing now

163
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:47,039
Router is not going to rest do you still determined to keep

164
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Traveling the world

165
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
Persuading different countries

166
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,927
De Pastor own versions of the magnitsky ACT

167
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,743
And right now as we're recording this

168
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
He is targeting three countries

169
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Ukraine

170
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
Gibraltar

171
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
A small country off the coast of Spain

172
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
In South Africa

173
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,007
And I take it that Vladimir Putin will not be pleased

174
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
This passes in

175
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,895
Every time and you country passes a version of the magnitsky ACT

176
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,991
It seems like Russia comes up with a new way to make Bill browder's life

177
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
More difficult

178
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
Thank you all so you're welcome

179
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:43,359
Earlier this year we are the podcast called Georgetown

180
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,943
Louisiana was actually a two part episode and it was about this

181
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
I need

182
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,015
Town Mary guinn Louisiana

183
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
And Noel King joints me now

184
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,623
Miracle in Louisiana had a sort of mist

185
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:01,279
It did the mystery was everybody in this tiny little town in the middle of nowhere in Louisiana is related or appears to

186
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
To be related

187
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
And nobody knows why

188
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
Or how they got down to Marin

189
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
And then

190
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,751
After using years of wandering the New York Times ran this story and it

191
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
Solve the mystery

192
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:16,383
These folks were in world Louisiana because their ancestors had been sold

193
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,735
By Georgetown University and the Jesuit order in Washington

194
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
They were slaves

195
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,831
And Georgetown and the Jesuits were in debt

196
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,927
And so these 272 men women and children were sold

197
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,999
Downs plantations in Louisiana Georgetown paid off

198
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
Dad send

199
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,583
All these people ended up and roll Louisiana

200
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
And this was a big

201
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
New story at the

202
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
The time

203
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Because

204
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,239
Georgetown University obviously

205
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
Preeminent educational institution and

206
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
Nation's capital

207
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,663
All the sudden had to Grapple with their part

208
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,967
In slavery in selling people

209
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,039
And had a realize this new story that there were thousands

210
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
Of descendants

211
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
It's out there who

212
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
They essentially owed something

213
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
What the podcast did was both

214
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,535
Visit some of those descendants in Louisiana

215
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
And talk to Georgetown

216
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
About what they were going to

217
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
To do about it

218
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
What direction did was a lot of on

219
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
Campus stuff educational stuff

220
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,799
They renamed some buildings in honor of the slaves

221
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
Students old

222
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,663
Are they starting some educational initiatives they're building out the library

223
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,015
It's a lot of it was like atoning but atoning on Georgetown campus

224
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,831
The big concrete thing that they were going to do for the

225
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
Descendants for the people who are alive today

226
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,719
Was to give them preferential admissions in the application

227
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,535
Process so if your descendant you want to come and Georgetown

228
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,327
We're going to give you a little bit of a boost

229
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,167
And one of things I loved about your story why is he went to visit young people

230
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Who now had this

231
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,495
Amazing opportunity

232
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,055
Vet came in a way

233
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
That no one I guess would wish

234
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
Right it's like this it's both

235
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,735
Sad but it's a tremendous opportunity for them and so you talked to

236
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,039
One young woman in particular her name was

237
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,879
Elizabeth Thomas Elizabeth Thomas's 23 and then wanted to go to grad

238
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,975
And when I talked to her she had just put in her application

239
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,047
And she'd written about being a descendant in her essay

240
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
In the beginning I kind of talked about you know

241
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
My connection to Georgetown

242
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,959
How be an amazing opportunity not only to go to a

243
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Excellent

244
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
Top to University but

245
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,079
To go to the place where my ancestors helped bill

246
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
Did you like

247
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,455
Flip it in or where you were you applying as a defendant and you

248
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:32,319
You sort of we're like at and by the way I mean I thought it was interesting that there is no

249
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,159
Where on the application to put that you are a descendant that was in March

250
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Did you talk to Elizabeth

251
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,047
And so the rest of the story and the rest of the story is Elizabeth got into Georgetown

252
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
I just going to go to grad school for journalism

253
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:49,215
Starts next month she's super excited she's super nervous and one of my big questions to her

254
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
This whole time has been

255
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,335
When you get up there are you going to tell people that you're defend

256
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
Yeah

257
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Definitely think

258
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
That I will

259
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Be telling

260
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,503
People I mean it shouldn't be a secret

261
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,063
However I don't think I'm going to walk around with a

262
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
Reparations t-shirt on

263
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,463
A lot of love I'm going to take it that far but I definitely am going to let

264
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
People now then

265
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
I'm here

266
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,303
Why I'm here my special

267
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Inoculation

268
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
If you make a great journalist

269
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:23,519
Are they are they paying her money to know they are not a scholarship

270
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
Bishop for academic

271
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,151
It'll cover about half of her tuition which is $14,000 each

272
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
But she was like

273
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,295
This is not a scholarship that I got for being a defendant and

274
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,391
I think I should get to go to Georgetown for free because my ancestors built this

275
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
She's really disappointed

276
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,231
Call met people who have the sort of

277
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
Historical context

278
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
Some college

279
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Here are you mad

280
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,119
Grandfather went here where this building is named

281
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
After my family

282
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,959
What an interesting way to relate

283
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
2

284
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
A place

285
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
Knowing that

286
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
This is to share going to

287
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Owned

288
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
Your answer

289
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
How does she expect to feel when she

290
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,063
She's there she actually already knows how she's going to feel because she's been to

291
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Visit the campus

292
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,647
Since you was telling me about this night she spent walking around

293
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
And like wow is this the brick that

294
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,767
Know my ancestry late is this the door is this

295
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
You know

296
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
Is this the road is

297
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
Set the path where did they live

298
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
It's

299
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
Going to be definitely

300
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
Aerie

301
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
Sad feeling

302
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,847
By Nature Elizabeth is very optimistic she's very likely to

303
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Push through this she's really

304
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
Excited about going

305
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
But there's obviously some mix

306
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,879
Alright thank you so much more

307
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:00,031
Hi Robert

308
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823

00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
About

311
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,015
Something that we love deeply in 2017

312
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Are trading Bots

313
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
The botes

314
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
The bottom of the United States

315
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,951
Her legs are all a little Fuller for having known

316
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Gear bonus

317
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
Who is created

318
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
Read Donald Trump's tweets

319
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
And then trade stocks

320
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
Every time he mentioned

321
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,983
I want to stop putting money into an investment account that we turned over to you

322
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
And the winds

323
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Of

324
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,615
A computer program a bot I don't know how to describe it

325
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,199
The highly thought out carefully crafted algorithm

326
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Of practice

327
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
Wall Street trading for

328
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,575
Professionals are what was behind our trading bot

329
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,927
I think I'm going to need a little bit of music

330
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
For this update

331
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Cuz

332
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,095
On November 21st 2017

333
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
We pulled the plug

334
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
Turn off the switch

335
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
Stop the little circuits

336
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,799
Anarbagh Taurus

337
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Kiss me

338
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
Otis was filled with heart

339
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,783
It live for one purpose and one purpose only and that was to trade

340
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,367
Put everything that had into trading also tweeting but mostly Trading

341
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
And it wasn't very good at

342
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
No no it was not

343
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
So I'm here to tell you

344
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
The final

345
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,095
Portfolio of bonus and how it had a lot of questions on this

346
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
I have

347
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,679
All two of the trades that boat is made

348
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
To trade but they're big one

349
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,287
So the biggest problem was that Donald Trump stop

350
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,591
Tweeting about company shortly after we began this

351
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,151
And then when he did he did it at like 4 in the

352
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479
So we

353
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,551
Change the algorithm so that when Donald Trump tweeted

354
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
It would then trade

355
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
First thing when the market open

356
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
That gave us a little bit of action

357
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
On August 23rd

358
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
A David

359
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
Will remain

360
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,815
Enshrined in memory and Glory

361
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
The president tweeted

362
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,703
Thank you Arizona beautiful turnout a 15000 in Phoenix tonight

363
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983

Andy

368
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
I thought that's a positive tweet when it was a positive trait that would buy stock

369
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
-8 with seltzer

370
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
Positive tweet on Facebook

371
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,599
I bought 5 shares

372
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Half an hour later

373
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
It's sold 5 shares

374
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
And we lost a total of

375
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Dollar fifty

376
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Downtown dollars

377
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
It could have been worse

378
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
A November 3rd

379
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:37,727
Donald Trump tweeted today we are thrilled to welcome at broadcom CEO

380
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,287
Hock tan to the White House to Nancy is moving their headquarters

381
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,871
Broadcom bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye

382
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
Bought 3 shares

383
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,455
So half an hour later lost

384
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Sixth Sense

385
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,063
I'm a Math Genius but this does not sound like we made a hefty profit

386
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Auburn.

387
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,415
No we put in $1,000 as a team and we lost

388
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
A dollar in 56

389
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Sent

390
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,535
And that's not even counting the fees which were waived by The Brokerage

391
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
So that means of your hundred dollars

392
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
You get $99

393
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
At 8

394
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,287
Yeah this is what I'm going to fess up when you are getting money from

395
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
All the members the Planet Money staff

396
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
I just

397
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,151
Secured did not give you

398
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,503
The money I overlooked that meant to do it and I never invested in the body

399
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
Which means that my hundred dollars

400
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:28,415
Freeloader which means that my hundred dollars was invested in the stock market which had about a

401
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
2% game

402
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
During this time

403
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
I'm so

404
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
I made for

405
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,119
Okay well I learned something

406
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,983
Okay and what I learned was that is really hard to maintain a algorithmic trading

407
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
Because it takes a

408
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,335
Super talented computer programmer

409
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
To constantly be looking at the code

410
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
Constantly updating

411
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
That was a thing that happened

412
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,247
But it should have traded a lot more

413
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
But

414
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,599
Almost every time it was supposed to trade something was wrong

415
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,671
And we didn't know because we didn't have somebody

416
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Full-time

417
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
A lesson worth every set

418
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279

Thanks for listening

Hey when last

459
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,463
I left for vacation before his show was actually finished

460
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
But there was one more story

461
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,815
It was an experiment really that we wanted to check in on

462
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,351
You may remember when we went to

463
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
The produce show

464
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,983
Producer Sally Helm found a magical hologram filled with nanocrystals

465
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
What are those are

466
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,287
That purported to keep

467
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
Fruit from rotting

468
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
Well she's been testing out

469
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Discard

470
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
Take it away song

471
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,039
Hate so I left some tomatoes and some strawberries and some file cabinet drawers in our office

472
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,623
One set with discard ones that without

473
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:44,511
And I just checked and the tomatoes are actually looking okay on both sides

474
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,303
Not not too bad

475
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,911
But one of the strawberries that was actually in with the card

476
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
Has grown

477
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,751
A bunch of mold looking sort of blue

478
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:59,871
I don't know I'm not a scientist I don't really know how to set up a controlled experiment but

479
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
That is mold

480
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
God is goddess

481
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
I know that that is mold
