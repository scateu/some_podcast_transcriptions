00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,536
Hey it's Alex

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,864
DUI hear that Russell

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,400
That is the sound of

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,424
One point

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,192
6

6
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,216
Billion dollars

7
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:09,984
Coming my way

8
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,008
A lottery

9
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,312
1011

10
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336

11
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,360
52

12
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,640
62

13
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
18

14
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,456
I pick those exact numbers

15
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,248
Because they are the same one

16
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:24,064
That were on the Planet Money Lottery Ticket almost 3 years ago

17
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,648
Thank you to everybody by the way messaging us about that episode asking

18
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,416
Replay

19
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,952
At the time we did that show

20
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,512
The Powerball pot was at 1.5 billion.

21
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,048
The biggest price of had been up

22
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,352
America had Lottery fever

23
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
And we got it too

24
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,656
We scrambled

25
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,192
Define the best stories we could about

26
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
Lottery

27
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,496
We found the oldest Lottery on

28
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,056
We talked to the man who beat the odds

29
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,080
Over and over again

30
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,152
And we crunched the numbers on whether or not it is a good deal

31
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
To buy a ticket

32
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,968
When the pot is as big as it is

33
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,272
And the numbers by the way back then

34
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,576
Pretty much the same as they are right now the outcomes

35
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,880
So we're leaving those calculations in the show

36
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,184
Only other thing I have to say is

37
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,768
What are producer Diane Woods has put in front of me and made me promise to read

38
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,328
I solemnly swear to split the pot with Planet Money

39
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,120
If we win with this lottery ticket

40
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
Even though I bought it with my own money

41
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
Okay with that

42
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
Here's the episode

43
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
2016

44
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,568
All right we have just 24 hours to put this whole show together

45
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
And also I need to know

46
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,920
Who's in I'm in I'm definitely

00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,552
Yeah you're a dime into it we're both good and then

49
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
Stacy's never got it

50
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,184
Never got a ticket never know I'm super excited I don't even know how to do it

51
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,488
Who here has bought a lottery ticket before

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
I have bought a lottery ticket

53
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
Before the fact I have one right here

54
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,888

55
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424

Bicycle

58
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,032
I feel like actually we could win

59
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:53,664
Like that is

60
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
Hello

61
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480

Robert Smith

63
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,392
This week the Powerball lottery is up to

64
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
1.5

65
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
Billion dollars perhaps you heard

66
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:11,840
So like everyone else in the country we are getting no work. We're spending all of our time

67
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,680
We have the story of one of the very first lotteries

68
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
The main prize is amazing you won't believe it

69
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:24,640
And with the story of the one time it made absolute economic sense to play the lottery

70
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
And we talked to the guy who pulled it off

71
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
But first

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
Stacy you and I

73
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
We got to take care of some business

74
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
All right

75
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184

00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
Since we have some time to kill before we

88
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,440
Quit our jobs

89
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
We thought we talked about

90
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,048
One of the very first times a lottery

91
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
Exist

92
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,400
And we have been kept mom and Stacey Vanek Smith here

93
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Totality

94
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,520
Can give you the footnote this is the first state lottery that we have good records

95
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
Oh as always

96
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:30,944
As long as 1567 isn't England and they have

97
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,504
This problem like the harbors are falling apart they need money

98
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,528
Everybody hates

99
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
Taxes

100
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,344
So their finance minister

101
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,464
I had just been to the Netherlands he saw they were trying out lotteries there and it works well he decided

102
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
Let's do it in England

103
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,584
But this was brand-new in England and so they had to try to figure out how do you

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,448
Explain what a lottery was two people how to get people on board and most importantly

105
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
How to sell tickets

106
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Laika a lottery ad campaign

107
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
You may be a winner

108
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Exact

109
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,664
And we talked to David Dean he is a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa

110
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
And he told us

111
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
The lottery in England with something like this

112
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
So imagine it is 1560

113
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
D7 you walk into the public market on

114
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
On Saturday

115
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,648
And there was a man shouting

116
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
Buy Lottery

117
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
We know that they have a Trumpeter

118
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
Sometimes they put on a little play

119
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
How about you know I'm so far I'm so far I'm so far all my God have won the lottery hippie I'm happy ever after you know

120
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,239
That is basically what Lottery ads are

121
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:31,103
To this day which people going like I can't believe it I'm so lucky throwing money in the air

122
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,503
He said they're also in the Marquis would have seen this like big poster that had the official seal of the government saying you can trust it this

123
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
This is for Real

124
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,831
And in the middle of it there were these pictures of the prizes

125
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
Is this thing still exist and he described

126
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:49,279
The prices are really cool because they show jugs and plates and their all gold and silver but they also have monkeys holding

127
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,071
Bags of coin

128
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
And wait until you hear the grand prize

129
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:58,239
Whosoever shall win the greatest and most excellent price shall receive the value of 5

130
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
Thousand pounds sterling

131
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,615
That is to say three thousand pounds in ready money that's cash

132
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,943
700 lb worth of plate gold and white

133
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
And the rest

134
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
In Good Cafe

135
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,807
History and also a bunch of them and coffee as well

136
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
What is the gold plate is that in like a

137
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
Bar or what does that mean

138
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
No it would be plates

139
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,023
And jugs and calluses and

140
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:27,935
Yeah and you you would sell that to melt it down or you treasure it on your man so pretty

141
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
Good grand prize

142
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
I mean it would be riches

143
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Beyond everyone

144
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Dreams

145
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
You paid 10 Shillings

146
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
To get one Lottery

147
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Ticket and

148
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
You would write

149
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
A poem

150
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,951
What was just something to uniquely identify yourself you know in case you want

151
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,279
God is mighty may I win or

152
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
Godspeed my Lots

153
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,607
Anderson Ferry

154
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,655
Scary ones like snakes mate

155
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,447
With garlic is good to eat

156
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
Why didn't people

157
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
Just leave their name

158
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,311
They don't have to ride in Ames that we have today

159
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,919
And there'd be a lot of confusion there a lot of Tom Smith's in the end

160
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,247
Robert Smithson that has so much more

161
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Literary

162
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,879
Then ours I feel like it's so much classier they had like criers and everybody wrote

163
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Poems

164
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
And now we have like

165
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
A guy with

166
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
Bunch of ping pong balls

167
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
In a vacuum on TV

168
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
They should absolutely do that

169
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:33,727
Like Daddy's like I want everyone if you have to do something a little player

170
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
The poem sing a song

171
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
What's your problem

172
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,383
I can't think of anything funny but

173
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
The Winner's clearly

174
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Our planet

175
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,015
Nice that's pretty good

176
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
Play Mariah

177
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
It is unclear exactly how this works but

178
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
At one possibility is like

179
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,463
When they pulled out the winning ticket they would just read like the first half

180
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,535
And the person who could complete the poem that would prove it with them

181
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,375
But he said despite like the trumpet

182
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,703
And all that stuff there are not a lot of tickets out

183
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
The whole idea of a lottery

184
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
Is just new and people

185
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
Do not trust the gum

186
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
Let you know they're not sure they're going to

187
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
Get there golden

188
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,919
And another thing is the tickets were expensive

189
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Tension

190
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,343
For a carpenter let's say in the city of London who's a pretty well paid person compared to Carpenters elsewhere

191
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,207
There any five Shillings a week so this should be a fortnite hacker month salary

192
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
How many people it would have been a president of a month's salary and a few or labor or Plowman or something you're talking about

193
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
Six months salary

194
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,215
So a lot of people ended up going in on a lottery ticket together

195
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
Exactly like we did

196
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,799
But they also had another idea to

197
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
To further entice people into buying tickets

198
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,407
They agreed to not arrest

199
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
People when they came in two by two

200
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:52,319
A lady was like you know if you lived out in the country or something maybe you done something wrong like you've stolen

201
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
A loaf of bread from somebody

202
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,439
Like don't worry you can come into town or you might normally be arrested

203
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
And we're not going to rescue you can buy it

204
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,327
Wow it's kind of like the embassy they have an overdue Library

205
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
Is one day only

206
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
Give us your money

207
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
And we want to rest

208
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,823
Does all ticket holders were promised freedom from arrest for all crimes other than murder felonies

209
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
Piracy or treason

210
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
That covers a lot

211
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
It does

212
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,015
It's covers that hit my day really really wanted people to come and buy tickets

213
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
So finally the big moment come

214
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Right everyone gathers down

215
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
It's outside St Pauls gift

216
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
They're going to pick the winner

217
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,975
He says he thinks it was probably all the tick

218
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
Barrel and there's one official

219
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,791
Pulled out the winner

220
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
And you want to know who the winner is

221
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
We don't know

222
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
What's the trouble

223
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
We have no idea

224
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
Today's no media coverage of the winner

225
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,871
No media coverage in the newspapers of the day

226
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:54,271
This Lottery was a total failure they only sold about one-tenth the number of tickets they were supposed to sell

227
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
Any actually ended up

228
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
Heading back the prize

229
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
To 1/12 of what it had been

230
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
Grand prize got cut

231
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
By that much

232
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
Oh my gosh that's

233
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,815
I mean the one that's that's

234
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,631
And of course that just reinforce everybody sense that

235
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,423
Okay this is a failure and it's not working

236
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
Then we will never try it again

237
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
But they did try to

238
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,335
Well they did over a hundred years later

239
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
Sore people smarter back then

240
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
I mean even back then people went

241
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
I have no chance of winning

242
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,087
I asked if it was it that you know they're like this is a stupid investment why do I do this

243
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
He said no no

244
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
It was just

245
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
They didn't trust the government

246
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
And it was very good

247
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,255
I wonder if they like cut the plates

248
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
7/2 or something

249
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,607
Or are you at we get 1/12 of a golden plate

250
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,911
There's somebody out those plates right now

251
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,751
But that's basically how it started the trend has been toward bigger and bigger

252
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Piles of

253
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
Money you know we had prepared the state lotteries and then

254
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
I would like all we can have a much bigger pot

255
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
And that's

256
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
As we have today that's the one

257
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
25 billion

258
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Does not include gold

259
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
Becky David

260
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
NCC stick around cuz we got to do so

261
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
Okay my favorite subject

262
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
Okay because we're economics reporters

263
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,303
We have to sort of do the numbers here

264
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
And show you that this is a

265
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Parable

266
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,911
Terrible terrible Financial investment

267
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
No matter

268
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
How excited we are about it

269
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
The numbers

270
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
Do not work in your favor

271
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
This very quickly back the envelope

272
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
The odds of winning

273
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:27,967
1 in 292 million it cost $2 for every ticket so if you wanted by every possible combination

274
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
That would be

275
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
600

276
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Million-dollar

277
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
He's what we take

278
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,927
So with the pots over 600 million then it starts to be worth it

279
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
So it's like 1.5 billion is

280
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,071
What you would get over many years if you took the lump sum

281
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
They figure it would be about

282
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,655
930 million dollars

283
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
It's still pretty good

284
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
But then you have to take away

285
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:54,079
Taxes you have to pay the highest tax rate on your lottery winnings

286
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,175
So that would mean you'd be left without 561

287
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
Million dollars

288
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
After take my federal taxes but ofcourse

289
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,623
You & I in the Planet Money Team live in New York City tax

290
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
Estate tax

291
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
So basically

292
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,719
It would Whittle down to about

293
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,767
Five hundred million dollars

294
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
Would be

295
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
Are lottery winnings

296
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
Will plus we have to split that 8 ways

297
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
Yea or more

298
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,215
I think they can

299
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,823
Game the system and play the odds of the lottery is that you have no control over who else buys your number

300
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,151
We could win with our numbers and somebody else out there

301
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
Could get the exact same.

302
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:36,063
But what are the chances of someone peeking exactly the same numbers in exactly the same order

303
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Well

304
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,463
You know in order to show this as an economic lesson

305
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:47,583
I think you something after you left the corner store that you did not hear so play that tape

306
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
Okay Stacy is left

307
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:55,775
So I would like to buy the exact same number again but this one's me personally I just want to get the same number again

308
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Same number

309
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
Salem

310
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
Alright so one of these is mine and one of these is the rest

311
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Farmers

312
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,439
Let's just say that if our numbers hit

313
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,767
What money of which I'm a member has to split it

314
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
With Robert Smith

315
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
The individual

316
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,143
Cutest

317
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,751
You just don't millions of dollars from us

318
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
The author not good

319
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
What fictional Milian's butt

320
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,943
What's the word I'm trying to demonstrate how

321
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,039
Difficult it is to consider the lottery a sane Financial invest

322
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
But

323
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,647
When we're doing research for the show we discovered

324
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,511
That there was one guy there was one guy who managed to figure out how to

325
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,559
To game this entire system

326
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
And with that story

327
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
Is

328
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,423
Planet Money senior producer

329
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Hi Robert

330
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,847
So it's 1992 in Virginia and there is a big lottery jackpot for the time 27 million

331
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
Dollars numbers

332
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Winner

333
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,735
Add it first there's nobody who comes forward

334
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:13,855
But there are reports that there was something that was maybe going on before the lottery drawing something suspicious

335
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,951
Starts to Dawn on them that something is up something is different about this

336
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,767
These reports

337
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
From around town

338
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:27,679
People have been going into different grocery stores buying 50,000 tickets at a time and different combinations

339
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
And they put it all together and they realize

340
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,031
That someone or some people

341
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
Have pulled off what is the dream

342
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
MO Lottery players

343
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
They took the luck out of Lottery they bought every single combination of numbers possible and guarantee themselves Irwin

344
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
And this is totally perplexing

345
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,463
To the people who run the lottery system like Ken Thorson head of the Virginia Lottery this is him on TV shortly after

346
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
I really never

347
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:56,607
Would have imagined that anybody would have ever wanted to try to buy it out if you never happened in the United States

348
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,191
But the very idea of spending over 7 million dollars

349
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
To buy all the shares in the lottery just seems

350
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Preposterous

351
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,359
Because think of what it would take I mean you need investment of 7 million

352
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
Actually go and buy

353
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,479
That many lottery tickets are going to be buying ticket

354
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,367
Twenty-four hours a day need to fill out each different ticket you need to keep track of where each ticket went so that when you win

355
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,183
You can sign the winning ticket and get somebody pulled it off

356
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Yes

357
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
His name is Stefan Mandel

358
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,071
I did a little research poke around and I found him

359
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
Living on a

360
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:34,495
Tropical island in the South Pacific for CSS in Vanuatu I made a phone call I got a cell phone and

361
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
And I rang him up

362
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Hello

363
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
Hello

364
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,431
Hi is this Stefan Mandel

365
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,991
I told him I'm a reporter and then I'm doing a story that Lottery

366
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,039
Are you willing to talk to me about it

367
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
For the radio

368
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
Let's go he died a long time ago

369
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,255
As soon as I started asking him questions he just could not stop he lit up cuz he

370
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
How did he pull this off and he says

371
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Listen Alex

372
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,887
That Virginia thing it took him decades and decades

373
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Perfect his system

374
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
To get to that low

375
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
The story starts in Romania

376
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
In Romania

377
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,799
Yeah and in the late 1950s

378
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:14,431
And Stefan Mandel is working at some job he doesn't really like it and Industrial mining

379
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Company

380
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
And he's got a wife young kids

381
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,807
And you just desperately wants out of the country

382
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,367
Money to do it and he starts looking at the lottery

383
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,695
That was the only way that I could get some

384
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Quick

385
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
I mean

386
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
Show me Life360 lay a month

387
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Which was the coolant

388
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Good pair of shoes

389
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,263
But it doesn't just go out and buy random

390
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
He's a pretty natural math

391
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,223
He goes to the library and start reading math paper aftermath paper aftermath paper and he comes up with a formula for

392
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Buying blocks of tickets

393
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
The he thinks

394
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Should guarantee him a prize

395
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
Because he doesn't have money to buy

396
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Every number

397
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Not yet

398
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:02,815
Okay he pulls in three friends they take their money together they still don't have enough money to buy every combination

399
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
But they figure they can guarantee themselves

400
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
Second prize we17

401
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
50 mm

402
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,727
783

403
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
Which was

404
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,895
Alright Big Score that was on your first try

405
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
Be honest was that luck

406
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
Wechat lock

407
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
Okay

408
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:28,927
Because he was playing for second prize but he happened to win first prize

409
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
So he takes the money any

410
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,047
Leaves Romania finally brings his family and they end up in

411
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
In Australia

412
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,887
And this is where he takes his Lottery planet to the neck

413
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Okay Define

414
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
More investors who raises more money

415
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
ASCII

416
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
This is what he saw

417
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,615
What is really the obstacle to this whole crazy scheme

418
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:53,759
Write normally when you want to pick out your own numbers for the lottery go to the corner store and he asked for that little form

419
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,855
With the numbers on it and you fill out each little form with the pencil it takes forever

420
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
Reese's

421
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
I'm not going to go

422
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
I'm going to order

423
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
Please set up a room

424
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
Filled with printers in it

425
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
Computer program is going to spit out

426
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,263
Those forms already filled out with every possible combination going to fill out the forms for him at high speed

427
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
Composition of the paper

428
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Print it out

429
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Scripps

430
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Redis

431
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
With a combination sander

432
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
Legal to have a computer fill out

433
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Just looked for you

434
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:36,511
It was legal when he did it and he turned Lottery winning into a business for a while

435
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,583
12 time

436
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,959
But I kind of got stuck up their noses

437
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,383
They changed a lot birthday passed a law that said

438
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:58,783
No one person can buy every combination lottery ticket it's just a literally do not do that again

439
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,391
And so then he broke it up into 50 different people who each bought 150 or the numbers

440
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,951
And so he keeps winning and eventually

441
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
They make enough sufficient laws

442
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
That prevent him from doing it again

443
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
But this turn up

444
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
Stefano.

445
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,375
No he started looking even bigger

446
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
He starts looking to

447
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,167
The US

448
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
He looks to a couple different states he starts doing the calculations again because you have to find a place where the jackpot is big enough to

449
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
Justify health is

450
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Printing

451
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
Analucifer

452
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
Right so he finds Virginia

453
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
And in Virginia

454
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:33,855
There are 7.1 million combinations of lottery tickets and he has to wait until the jackpot is

455
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:39,231
He figures 25 million or above just make sure he turns a profit if there's a split pot

456
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
And then

457
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
He waits

458
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,839
He sets up his whole operation for when the time is

459
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
To print out the the numbers

460
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
Yeah

461
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,151
They printed out all 7.1 million tickets in Australia paid $60,000 to ship them to the US

462
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,503
Negotiated bulk buys with grocery stores all around Virginia

463
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,063
About how they could send cashier's check to buy

464
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
Tens of thousands of lottery tickets

465
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,647
I mean it's like a bank heist

466
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
How complicated is what

467
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
Event on the night

468
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,095
The Virginia Lottery I he did not have the same feeling that all of us have

469
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
Right now

470
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
Awaiting the numbers

471
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
To come out from

472
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Powerball

473
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,959
Disguise

474
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,495
Knew he had in the back

475
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,775
Yeah but I asked him where you

476
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,847
Were you scared were you worried are you excited you're just like

477
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
I have all the time

478
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,455
I knew that would win one prescribed

479
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
6

480
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
Second prizes

481
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,343
132

482
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
Mind if I

483
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,719
27 million + saw those minor prizes

484
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,767
Electronic

485
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:49,119
There is a little dispute about whether or not he really bought all of these tickets or whether he came

486
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
Pretty close

487
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,423
Because there were a few stores

488
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
Who just said oh my God this is too much

489
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,031
You have to stop coming in with all these tickets

490
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
In the middle of his Vines

491
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
But he swears to me

492
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,407
That he found workarounds for all that he had Back-up Plan

493
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
And in the end he did buy all the

494
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,551
So did he have any advice for anyone who's thinking of doing this

495
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
On the scale of a

496
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Powerball

497
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
Giant like

498
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,695
Billion dollar prices are coming at 9 cannot be done any

499
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:20,607
He says you cannot do it the number of combinations of grown too much you wouldn't be able to print the tickets he wouldn't be able to buy the

500
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
Xiamen time

501
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,471
And you probably couldn't even do the math right to figure it out without making a mistake

502
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
So he might be the last

503
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
Guy who is able

504
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,079
The corner the market

505
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,919

00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687

See on the beach of Vanuatu

509

510
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
Definitely Robert

511
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,952
Find lottery lawyer.com than buying an actual lottery ticket

00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,512

00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
All this fun we've had a side

539
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
You really should not

540
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Buy a lottery

541
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
The terrible path

542
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,752
Especially since we don't want to split the pot any more than we already have

543
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,616
Do not buy 1011 51/52 6280
