00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:05,376
Hey it's Jacob Goldstein Today Show is a rerun that originally aired in 2000

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,144
12

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,912
Puritas

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,824
A few years ago Justina Clayton started a hair braiding business in our home in Centerville Utah

5
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:18,432
She learned to braid hair as a girl growing up in Sierra Leone end in Utah

6
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:22,784
She found this little niche working for local families that had adopted kids from Africa

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,856
Her business letter stay home with her own kids and

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,904
And some months you made enough to pay for grocery

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,208
Put an ad on a local website

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,792
Then one day she got an email from a stranger who had seen the ad

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
It said

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,864
It's illegal in the state of Utah.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,144
How to do any kind of expand

14
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,936
Without a cosmetology

15
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,752
No way

16
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,288
I responded I said go ahead

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
Airport me

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,128
But just to be on the safe side she called the state license

19
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,432
And she found out that she did needle

20
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,712
And that to get it

21
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,272
She have to spend more than a year in cosmetology

22
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,600
Tuition would cost $16,000 or more

23
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,136
I was really upset

24
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,928
I know who am I threatening here

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,952
I did a lot of

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,536
Talking to my husband

27
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,584
He listened he was very kind

28
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,656
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob Goldstein

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,216
But I'm Alex blumberg and today on the program

30
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,776
Why it's illegal to braid hair in Utah without a license

31
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,104
And why that rule and others like it are a disaster for the USA

32
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:27,552
We'd like to say a quick thank you and share a message from one of our sponsors

33
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
State Farm

34
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,136
State Farm it's much more than just an insurance

35
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,744
They're also committed to making a positive impact in the communities they serve

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,792
One way is through neighborhood of

37
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:43,168

And start turning the power of caring

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
Into the act of doing

41
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,408
State Farm

42
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
Here to help life

43
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Go right

44
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,672
After she got that email and found out she needed a license

45
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,208
Justina close down our business

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
She figured it just wasn't worth it

47
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
The time and money to go to

48
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:14,400
But she did get to go and make her case to the board that regulates hair braiding in Utah

49
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,520
Full name of that board by the way the barber cosmetology / Barber

50
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,056
Aesthetics electrology

51
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
A nail technology licensing

52
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,504
Thank you so I took to get ready for her meeting with the b c d e n t

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,136
Shelby jestina called around to different cosmetology schools in Utah she found out

54
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,232
Those schools taught little or nothing about the African style hair braiding that

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
She also learned that there's some other states where

56
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,192
People can do African Hair Braiding if they pass just a basic safety and hygiene test and pay registration fee

57
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:53,824
And so she took all this and put it together into a PowerPoint presentation explaining these things and then she

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
Went to the board meeting on

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
Waited outside the meeting room while the board took care of its other piss

60
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,736
So finally was my turn and I got in

61
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
I was super nervous

62
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,856
I stood up and I started talking and there was

63
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,880
One lady

64
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
Just kept

65
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,000
Bitching in ultrasound

66
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
I side with tacos

67
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,352
Yeah right you know just under her breath

68
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
She kept doing that and then

69
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
What was the impression you got from what she was

70
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
That

71
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
She didn't believe anything that I said

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
But

73
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
Chair of the meeting

74
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,152
She said that I would have to change

75
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,200
Slow because as the law is written

76
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
If you touch her for money

77
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
If you style hair for money

78
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,576
Then you need a cosmetology

79
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
She said there's nothing that they can do

80
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:43,744
What happened to Justina happens all the time with all different kinds of jobs all around the country

81
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
There is this

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,352
Patchwork quilt of State Licensing Laws and it covers

83
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
Hundreds of different profession

84
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,936
It's not just you know doctors and lawyers

85
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,520
Garage door repairman its interior designers

86
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,640
Landscapers athletic trainers masseuses and literally hundreds of other professions

87
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,200
I need a sensible reason for all these licensing

88
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
Is that these requirements protect the public in some way

89
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,880
Charles wheelan teaches public policy at Dartmouth in the University of Chicago

90
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,256
That may be true but for people in license Fields a licensing law conserve

91
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
An entirely different purpose altar

92
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,887
It's also a way to make your competition go away

93
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,215
And that if you are practicing a profession anything

94
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
So let's use

95
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
Manicure assistant example

96
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,871
And there's a lot of competition say from

97
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,455
Asian immigrants which is the case in Chicago

98
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,551
And you want to limit that competition you can go to your State Legislature

99
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:46,207
And you can say you know what it should be harder to be a manicurist you should have to pass an exam or hold a degree

100
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
Free or do assorted other things

101
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,095
In that case you really just built a fence around your profession

102
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:56,959
It keeps out competition lower Supply in basic economics says that means your

103
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,519
Can I do better you either get paid more or you'll have more work

104
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:05,663
And for the rest of us that is for those of us getting manicures this means that managers are more expensive

105
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,247
Maybe you've noticed that yourself I'm paying an extra dollar or two for my manicure

106
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Maybe

107
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
It doesn't bother you that

108
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,647
But there is this other big problem with these license

109
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
They make it harder for people to find work

110
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,535
One clear example is Justina who we heard from the top

111
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
How to get work in the special nephew have to go

112
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Schools spend a lot of money

113
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
But even if you have a license

114
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
Chances are the state license

115
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
Probably won't work

116
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
In another state

117
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,383
Will licensing is not particularly good for anybody who's trying to switch profession

118
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,735
Or trying to move to another location where the economy may be bad

119
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,391
So we don't in general Mobility is pretty good as a saddle for a bad economy because some places are going to be stronger than other

120
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:53,279
Father so people may be leaving Michigan when the auto economy is weak then maybe going to the Southwest

121
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:58,143
If there's a lot of growth are so part of what we like about the labor market

122
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,751
Is you get price signals and unemployment signals and people should go where there's demand

123
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,567
As soon as you introduce State Licensing

124
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
It just makes it that much harder for people to do those things

125
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
And I want to go on record as saying that I'm not

126
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,599
Averse to regulation in general and I'm not even averse to the idea of Licensing some profession

127
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,159
I just think that we've done it so horribly

128
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
And so

129
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
Scattershot terms of who gets license

130
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,327
And what they have to do to become licensed that it's become kind of a monster

131
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,167
In the monster is huge and I were talking about a a big

132
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,703
Swap of the labor market

133
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Just giving comparison

134
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,079
Back in the 50s one-and-twenty jobs require license

135
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Today

136
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
One in every three jobs

137
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:47,551
So we have the situation we're at least in some cases consumers and the economy are being hurt and

138
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:53,183
It seems like the only people who benefit are actually the ones in the industries that are being regulated

139
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,023
Which is interesting right you always hear this idea that businesses opposed to regular

140
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
Station that businesses jelly went last regulator

141
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,655
And as we talked about in the podcast this is one of these examples

142
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
Businesses are often

143
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
In favor of Regulation. They love it

144
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,031
Exactly the reason we're talking about it helps

145
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
Make them more money

146
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
Although

147
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Just driving

148
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,687
That's not what they say to the legislators when they're trying to get the

149
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
Licensing requirements pass

150
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,039
You can't go to the government say hey pay me some money

151
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,111
Because that's quite transparently not the right thing to do

152
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,951
What they typically do is they go to the legislature

153
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,559
And they don't say I quite like I'm going to say it but they essentially say we're really Danger

154
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,375
You need to protect the public from us

155
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:38,495
When I wrote my dissertation I actually had some case studies I looked at respiratory therapist

156
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,823
In the case of the respiratory therapist when they went to Springfield

157
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
They actually had a videotape

158
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Of a truck blowing up

159
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:51,807
And the reason the truck was blowing up as it was transporting oxygen in a way that was inappropriate that they said look we can blow things

160
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,623
Protect the public from us

161
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,719
Cosmetologist as far as I know they cannot blow up

162
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Trucks

163
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:05,119
But I did call Mayra Irizarry she works for the Professional Beauty Association is a trade group

164
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,679
She actually listed for me all the ways

165
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,495
Untrained cosmetologist couldn't harm people

166
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
There could be open wounds are to be cut

167
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Pathogens

168
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
Could be transmitted

169
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,687
And here we have people that are practicing this field that could

170
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
Really

171
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,343
You do wonderful things for your appearance in him for your face and for your skin but also could harm you

172
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,671
These regulations are requirement and a necessity

173
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
For Consumer safety

174
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,511
I don't think that there's any way to go around

175
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
Consumer safety

176
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,375
That when it comes to Hair Braiding Charlie Wheeling rxperts

177
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Doesn't buy

178
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
Mayra Irizarry the argument

179
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,031
Dammit this is this classic situation where you have a small group of people have passed away.

180
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
EBenefits

181
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,919
But he was talking to you Jacob ee got at the winners singing louder than the losers cry

182
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
You know you've got the

183
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
The small group of benefit quite a bit from these

184
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
And then you got this much

185
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Larger crew

186
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
Consumers

187
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,391
Target has very minor wear that maybe they don't even notice

188
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,463
And then you have this this third group this

189
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,535
People who want to work in a field but but can't

190
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,839
People obviously like Justina Clayton

191
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,167
And for them the pain of this can really be

192
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
Cute Justina

193
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
Cheat she talked to me about how she

194
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,335
She grew up in Sierra Leone in the middle of the Civil War and then she came

195
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Came to America and she had these

196
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,943
Ideas about America and to know when she talks about

197
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
It's a very emotional thing

198
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
When I Civil War started

199
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
And

200
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,135
You don't for a long time just

201
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
It's just been survival

202
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
You know just

203
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,255
Make sure that the next day is

204
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
You know that I'm alive the next day

205
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
That my friends are

206
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
And then

207
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
You know I finally make it here

208
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
You know

209
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,615
Going up you just know American supposed to be

210
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
It's just you have lots of options

211
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
Your potential

212
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
From getting from

213
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
1

214
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
Would low and to a higher

215
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
And as

216
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
Increases when you were here

217
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
It just

218
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
Not being able to do that

219
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
I don't know

220
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
Angry patient

221
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Hope for the best

222
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,823
Justina has hooked up with the legal group called The Institute for justice

223
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:26,431
This is a Libertarian group they're actually suing the state of Utah on justina's

224
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:31,295
Half and they filed a bunch of lawsuits in in states around the country challenging different license

225
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,391
Any of Licensing rules have been a traditional Battleground for

226
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
For Libertarians and text me to Robert Smith

227
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,231
The story while I go back like a libertarian

228
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
Stitch to protest by manicuring

229
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839
Somebody's fingernails on the governor's mansion lawn

230
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:49,983
But there's also this big anti licensing Bushnell from the left from more liberal Economist and activists

231
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,543
Michelle Obama has been talking about making things

232
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:58,175
Easier for the spouses of people who work in the military that have a hard time with licensing rules when they move from State

233
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
The state

234
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
Alan Krueger

235
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
Is now the chairman of President Obama's Council of economic

236
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,599
Advisors at the proposal the basically said

237
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,647
They should get rid of their licensing rules

238
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,183
If they're doing more harm than good

239
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:14,559
And that's a useful way to think about it I find because you know people often think about this issue as

240
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,399
Should have given profession be licensed or not yes or no

241
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,727
And people like Charlie will and they say that's the wrong way to think about

242
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
The question is

243
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:27,103
Do the regulations the licensing rules do they actually do what they claim

244
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
Do they protect the pub

245
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
It's not sufficient

246
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
To tell me that somebody can do harm

247
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
In a profession

248
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,855
Anybody can do harm in a profession if you're really incompetent

249
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,671
The burden of proof has to be on you

250
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,231
To prove to me the legislature

251
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,303
That whatever licensure mechanism we put in place

252
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,607
Will actually solve this problem

253
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
Flashy Elevate quality

254
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:56,543
It shouldn't be just a foregone conclusion that if you're potentially dangerous anything we throw on the books is going to be in approved

255
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,615
Some State lawmakers have also started to push back

256
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Against

257
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Licensing requirements

258
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,735
In Florida there's a bill introduced to loosen requirements

259
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,295
For among other things dance studios

260
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
And Auctioneers

261
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:15,231
And plus you're a legislator in Utah actually introduced a bill to allow African style hair braiding without a lie

262
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,815
But when Justina went to testify at the hearing

263
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
She found the room packed with

264
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
Cosmetologist

265
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Cosmetology school

266
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,239
Somebody told me that they are all in a cosmetologist

267
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,031
Apparently they give them the day off

268
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
So they can come

269
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
And

270
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Protest

271
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
This bill

272
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
It was intense

273
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
The cosmetologist exceeded

274
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,111
The built it didn't become a lot and it is still illegal in Utah to braid hair for money without a light

275
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,279
That was how the show ended back in 2012

276
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
I'll have an update on what happened since then

277
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
After this

278
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:57,471

A registered broker-dealer

287
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,655
Just a few months after we did this story Justina won her case in court

288
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,495
A judge said the cosmetology law should not apply to her business

289
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,823
And a few months after that the Utah Governor made it official

290
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,151
He signed into law a bill that makes it legal

291
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,943
Two braids hair in Utah without a license

292
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
Justina was able to go back to

293
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,599
In the years since then this issue has continued to be a thing

294
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,159
In fact one case went all the way to this

295
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Supreme Court

296
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,511
In that case the Dental Board in North Carolina had barred

297
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Spas in

298
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,583
Hair salons from doing teeth whitening

299
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
They said that could only happen at the dentist office

300
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,751
The Obama Administration intervened saying hair salons and spas kudu teeth whitening

301
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,055
And when it got to the Supreme Court

302
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,615
The Court ruled against the Dental Board

303
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,223
It is now legal for spas and hair salons in North Carolina to do.
