To the left

34
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,208
It was like

35
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
Not if you're in a car

36
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,048
That's always crash into the side of you

37
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,120
Yeah. That was kind of the pool at the FL

Pretty close to the mount

00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,008
A lot lower than you'd expect

42
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
And then things get worse

43
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,760
Sore throat and something's not quite right here

47
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:30,880
The pilot comes over the intercom and says yet but definitely got an engine issue and looks

48
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
The girl lacrosse

Cafe Le quite tight what the captain says next is pretty disconcerting

53
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,168
We are just going to to do about emergency landing

54
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
And run

55
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,288
Everyone's like what

56
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,128

Are they allowed to do that is it okay put your seat back in the upright and locked

59
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
Position secure your oxygen mask

60
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,184
Before assisting others

61
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
Fasten your seatbelt

Today on the show we go with Dario into era

63
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:14,144
Where we land in the middle of one of the most contentious fights in the world right now

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Different decades

65
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Usns allies

66
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,240
Have cut up around from the rest of the world

Using sanction

68
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
So This Plane can land in a run

69
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,384
But getting out will be much more complicated

Flights like Dario's heading from Dubai to

79
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
Europe has a difficult choice of how to get

80
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,544
Yeah go to direct line in your flying right over a rocket

81
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
Not grades

82
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,640
So you can either go where your way over Egypt

83
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
Or go more direct

84
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Can fly override

85
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
Most Airlines choose a run-in

86
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
Including Norway

87
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
Soap back on Dario's flight

88
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,392
The pilots see the low oil warning light

89
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
And they shut off

90
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
Don't worry there's two engines

91
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,280
A turn toward the nearest airport

92
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,376
In Shiraz Iran and they land the plane at it Wars

93
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
Weather weather

94
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,984
The best landing elevator when I've ever been on

95
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,384
Smooth Landing with only one engine. Is something that Norwegian air knows how to do anywhere in the world

96
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,200
But everything else beyond that

97
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
In a wrong

98
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Is the question

99
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
Norwegian air has never landed in around before they don't have any business relationships in a rundown of the path

100
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
Passengers even have visas

101
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
The taxi

102
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,512
To the gate everyone gets out of the airplane

103
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,816
And at that point the flight crew Huddle's

104
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
With some Irani

105
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
In the airport

106
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
And they're doing the two problems here

107
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
First is getting

108
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
The passengers

109
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
Onto their final test

110
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,800
Second is to fix

111
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,128
The airplane so I can go back to making money for Norwegian

112
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
1 hour

113
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
3 hours 4 hours

114
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
And finally the caps

115
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
Back and says

116
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
All right

117
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
Here's what we're going to do

118
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
Sew weave

119
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:14,464
Obviously not getting us that Jesus is Uncharted territories what would happen as we were going to

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,047
Take you today at the hotel when catch

121
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,375
You don't have a Visa for Iran

122
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,447
So the delish me to leave your passport at the airport

123
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Wow

124
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Yeah exactly

125
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:31,615
Everyone's like I've seen this movie and it does not end well

126
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
No one

127
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Is thrilled about this

128
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
But they don't have a choice

129
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,503
So Dario hands off his passport and everyone heads to Haute

130
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,367
They're kind of surprised by where they end up because you know they flew in on a budget Airline

131
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,183
But the hotel that they go to that was

132
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
Absolutely Lush

133
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,535
Peopleworks superfamily welcome to send

134
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
There was a gentleman play the piano which is rather nice

135
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
And Then There Was You

136
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Optavia food

137
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
Drinks

138
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
Dario's tired

139
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
Just head to bed

140
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,823
It's actually really happy to be there

141
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
He can now checker on office

142
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
Not everyone is

143
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Is thrilled to be

144
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
Stuck in Iran

145
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
We all just sat around in the lobby

146
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
Basically saying this is

147
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
William McCoy

148
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
He was also on the flight with

149
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,183
What does girlfriend he's from Ireland says a lot of the past

150
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,791
Centers we're Irish or Scottish if we could have some a few drinks

151
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,119
We would all the Irish day we said we could have had a great night bush

152
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,935
There was no bad cuz it's illegal to drink been around

153
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,263
It's not like these Lads can just go check out the local attractions

154
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
They can't even cross the

155
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,127
Street I had a really bad headache

156
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,967
So there is a pharmacy straight across rodent that can I go

157
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,551
I know you aren't allowed with no one was allowed to leave the hotel

158
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Because

159
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
We have no visas for the country

160
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
Sober and exhausted

161
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
Liam go

162
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
In the morning a new plane has

163
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
Finally arrived to pick the

164
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,863
But one last thing before they head to the airport

165
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,935
Someone asks the women in the group to cover their hair be

166
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
That's the law in a run

167
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
And the hotel helps them out

168
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Improvise

169
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
The hotel providers

170
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,127
It seems like always bed sheets

171
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
His girlfriend put one on

172
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
It looks

173
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,223
Ridiculous on her because it was

174
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
The sheet was like

175
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:19,135
Huge and she's got really small head from there dial says the hotel staff bid them farewell

176
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
They did have just one final request

177
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
Old who takes a four-lane. They are

178
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,327
Do a Hundred Flowers signify in Kenosha for coming to visit

179
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
Hotel in

180
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
Find clothes for Cummins Hit and Run

181
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
I had a choice

182
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
Can we go into TripAdvisor in and

183
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
And you don't tell them about the

184
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,591
Experience that go to the airport and

185
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
They are local celebrity

186
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
By this point

187
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:46,271
People are shaking their hands people are handing the magnets that say welcome to a run on them

188
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
And they get on the plane and leave

189
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,463
Yep the passengers got out on the replacement plane but now Norwegian has a much bigger problem that plane they flew in

190
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
Needs attention pic

191
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
And US sanctions are going to make that

192
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Very hard to

193
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
They have

194
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
Turn to run

195
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,447
Into like the hotel California for this error

196
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Can lender

197
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
But can it ever leave

198
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
After the break

199
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
We will try to figure that out

200

209
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,351
There is one person who kind of wished he was there in a Ron with REO and Liam

210
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
Dean constant tinnitus

211

Teens in aviation

212
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,263
Consultant work at Virgin Airlines for a decade has his pilot license

213
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,079
And also just follow this stuff all the time

214
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,151
So he been following the plane while this was all happy

215
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
He is the reason we know about it

216
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
Iran is such a

217
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,295
An interesting Aviation Space

218
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
Fred and Aviation

219
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:59,231
Does people who literally go to Iran just a fly on a handful of aircraft that you just can't fly on

220
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,535
Any more fuel of 54 Chevys you got a cube

221
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,863
If your thing is classic airplanes you go to Ron

222
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,167
Some of the planes in Iran have been flying

223
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
420 30 even 40 years

224
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,287
Because of the sanctions that existed for so long

225
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:19,199
Always classic airplanes 7 to 7707 Sabine flying around in Iran for long.

226
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
Sanctions that created this

227
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
Aviation time

228
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,111
Capsule were put in place after the Iranian Revolution in 1979

229
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:31,231
And then tightened in the 90s to try to prevent a run from developing nuclear weapons

230
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:37,887
They were then briefly lifted under a deal that we've all heard about the nuclear deal brokered in 2015

231
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
And Irani in aviation

232
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
Almost made it in

233
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Into the 21st

234
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Right at that my

235
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
Right after the sanctions lifted

236
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Run order

237
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
39

238
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,895
Billion dollars of planes

239
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
From Boeing and

240
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,807
But then in 2017 the sanctions were reinstated after President Trump

241
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
Withdrew the us from the

242
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Video

243
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,951
And say about me didn't even stop manufacturing the airplanes of an order for the jail

244
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,767
It was a last-minute Dash

245
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
I think in

246
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,399
24 hours leading up to the Embargo kicking in where I think

247
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
Airbus

248
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
Ferreting around 6

249
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
ATR 72 aircraft

250
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
Just in trial a canal behind each other just to get them in exactly sure when they were delivered but the planes that

251
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
Made it into a run work

252
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,247
Free from Airbus and 13 from another man

253
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
So

254
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
Here's Where We Are

255
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
Norwegian needs to fix it NJ

256
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
But under the sanctions

257
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,231
You can't import technology with more than 10% American made car

258
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
And if they want

259
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:41,119
You know a hall pass from the US government if they want an exception to that rule

260
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:46,751
Their first call will be to the treasury Department or it specifically the office of foreign assets

261
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,287
Assets control or ofac

262
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
How about that

263
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,199
The treasury Department office of foreign assets control call center is currently closed due to the government shutdown

264
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
Yeah the majority of the time

265
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
This Plane have been stuck in Iran

266
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
The US government

267
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
With shutdown

268
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,391
But it's safe to say that Norwegian did not

269
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,743
I just sit around they probably called a few lawyers who know how to navigate sanctions

270
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
So we called one to his name

271
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Is Eric Ferrari

272
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
I feel like

273
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:17,215
For every taste that you work on you must have one of those like serial killer walls with

274
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
With red yarn

275
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,663
Yeah I mean there's a there's a lot that goes into it getting an exemption to

276
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,735
International sanctions is surprised complicated

277
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
It's working to simplify into

278
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Three

279
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
The first one read the fine print

280
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,927
There are some exemptions that are written directly into the sanction

281
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,255
You're able to just proceed so long as you're able to

282
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,839
I approve that all the conditions are met but triple-check

283
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
If you're wrong

284
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
You'll get big fines

285
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,959
And possibly even jail we can assume that Norwegian

286
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
Has already done this read the fine print

287
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,359
We did call them they understandably did not want to get into detail with us

288
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
Which brings us to number two

289
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
What's 8

290
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
And we don't know this definitively

291
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
The Norwegian Deeds

292
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
Hayirli Nuen

293
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
If some other country save

294
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
Germany has this engine

295
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
Norway can

296
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Borrow it for like

297
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
One-time pass into her

298
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
But intentions matter here

299
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
There we can't just call Germany and ask them

300
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Time to buy an engine

301
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Germany has to just

302
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,679
Randomly have it there lying around

303
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Which

304
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
For being honest

305
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,239
Is a bit of a long shot

306
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
Soap does first two options are basically legal

307
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
The third one

308
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,127
Is where you straight about the US government print

309
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
Ofac is wide

310
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
Discretion to Grant

311
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
Licenses

312
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,599
If there's a determination made that it's in the National

313
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
Security or foreign policy

314
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
Interest of the United States

315
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
Duseau National Security

316
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
In foreign policy

317
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
As much as Norwegian

318
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Want to say

319
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,631
Come on ofac

320
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
We're losing money out here

321
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,983
I mean it's inherent in sanctioning that somebody's going to lose money

322
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
Kind of the point so if

323
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
She were working on the

324
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
Best case and he were going for the

325
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Assumption

326
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,943
Eric says he would write a letter that is

327
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Basically

328
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Gyro fat

329
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Don't grant us

330
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,135
This exemption this plane stays in Toronto and that is not the purpose of

331
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Sanctions

332
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
Also PS

333
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
If you let the plane stay there

334
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,327
Too long you don't have any control over what might happen to that plane if it

335
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,143
We get confiscated or seized by the government

336
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,543
So like if you want to be the ones to give her on a brand new fancy playing that you created sentient

337
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,591
Difficulty to prevent them from getting

338
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
Be Our Guest go for it

339
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
Obviously

340
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
This is not what the sanction

341
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,039
The US is not trying to disincentivize Pilots

342
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
For making safe emergence

343
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,951
They're also not trying to keep this a hundred-million-dollar airplane owned by one of our allies

344
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
Stuck on the tarmac in

345
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,303
Losing by one estimate half a million dollars every month

346
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,119
But this is the thing about us sanctions

347
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
The US cast

348
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
A very wide

349
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
The sanctions

350
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,495
Don't just punish a run

351
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,799
They're meant to actually cut off Iran from the rest

352
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
What's the world

353
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,919
And the way they do that is by penalizing anyone from anywhere who tries

354
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Do business with a

355
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Which is how

356
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
The United States got in the middle

357
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
Of Norwegians business

358
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
And Dario's vacay

359
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,671
Now that the US government is at long last open

360
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
Norwegian can start down this

361
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
Long and complicated path

362
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
But as we sit here recording this

363
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
The plane is still in Iran

364
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,911
Dario and his fellow passengers they did get out of her on

365
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
But not without complication

366
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:32,031
Few minutes after they took off your captain speaking

367
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
Choo-Choo The increased capacity of people 1/4 and the stronger-than-expected

368
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:43,551
We actually don't have enough fuel and you're going to have to do another message to Landon

369
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
We're going to stop

370
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Dolphin pool in Vista

371
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,159
Apparently because a new crew had to fly the plane in

372
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
There were just too many

373
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,511
