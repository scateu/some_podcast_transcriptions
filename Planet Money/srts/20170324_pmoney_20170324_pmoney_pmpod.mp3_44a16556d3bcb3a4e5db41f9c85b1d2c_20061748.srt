Basically alone in the world

14
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:36,096
515 Biddle graduated the top of the class Princeton

15
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,680
And with the help of family connections he sells off to Europe to take the grant

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,984
Andrew Jackson killed a man in a duel

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,032

00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,016
Finally of course Andrew Jackson becomes president of the United States

22
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,064
And Nicholas Biddle becomes president

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088

Biddle and Jackson get into a fight

27
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,976
Jackson wants

How to kill beetles

29
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,816

In the streets

36
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,904
And this fight between Andrew Jackson and Nicholas Biddle

37
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
In a way it's still going on today

38
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,608
It's a fight over who gets to control money in America

39
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:46,496

And you can see it to this day

50
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,760
There is a building that looks like

51
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
The Parthenon

52
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
Big me to Stone

53
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
There so many

54
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
So many definitely more columns

55
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
In the 1820s this building with the center

56
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
Of the American Financial world

57
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
It was the bank

58
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
Of the United States

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
The bank of the United

60
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
States in the 1812

61
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
It was unlike

62
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,240
Anything we have in this country

63
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
In fact

64
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,336
It was unlike anything else we had in the country back then

65
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,152
There were lots of little local state

66
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,200
But the bank of the US was the

67
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Only Bank in the

68
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,528
The top rated all over the

69
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,136
It was created by an act of Congress that David a monopoly to do that

70
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,488
The federal government kept its money there. It's banking with the bank of

71
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,328
But the bank of the US was a private Corporation

72
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
Invisible to its shareholders

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
Run for a profit

74
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,680
And inside

75
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
This Greek

76
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Building

77
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,032
In the very back and a giant office

78
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
Was a man with his fingertips stuck together in a thousand yard stare

79
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
Bones of Alexander Hamilton

80
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,528
Nicholas Biddle

81
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
The president

82
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,576
Of the bank of the United States

83
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,392
In any movie of this bill would be the villain

84
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
Oh

85
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,280
Oh you hurt me saying that

86
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
Cordelia Francis Biddle

87
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
Nicholas Biddle

88
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
Great

89
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Great

90
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
Great

91
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Granddaughter

92
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,288
You're right person

93
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
Well I take it personally because I'm writing about him

94
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,688
It's not even personal to Biddle though like you don't I mean it's just

95
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
Structural he's like

96
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
The rich Banker

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
Like of course he's the villain

98
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,880
Of course you're absolutely right and I would have thought I would have said that

99
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
4 years ago

100
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
You're a Biddle

101
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,047
Cordelia's opinion about her

102
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
Whatever great great

103
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,863
Great-grandfather

104
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,423
It changed when she learned something important

105
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
About him

106
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,031
Nicholas Biddle was really good at his job

107
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
As you know head of the bank of the US

108
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
And that was

109
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,663
Really good for the US in a bunch of

110
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,735
The bank of United States was doing a lot of the economics

111
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
Stop that today is the job

112
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Government

113
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Federal Reserve

114
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
Soap for one thing

115
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
The bank of the us back then

116
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Printed paper money

117
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,487
At the time official government money was just

118
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Gold and silver

119
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
The government didn't make any paper money

120
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,679
And if you took a gold coin to a local bank that bank would give you

121
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
Piece of paper

122
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
What's the bank's name on it

123
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,031
Can I owe you a claim check

124
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
You or anyone else could

125
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
Turn that into the bank

126
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
To get your gold back

127
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
These banknotes

128
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
Became functionally money

129
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
Almost all the banks in the country

130
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
Hit the spot because the bank

131
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
The US was the only National Bank

132
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
It's banknotes worth

133
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,159
We're way better at you could use them anywhere in the country

134
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,719
And I made it much easier to do business all around the country

135
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,535
You could get a big town in New York City spending New Orleans

136
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,887
There was another thing the bank did for the country under Biddle that was really important

137
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
It cushioned economic booms and busts

138
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
Today that is what the Federal Reserve.

139
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
The job of the Central Bank

140
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
But that didn't exist

141
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
Back that it wasn't even created until the 20th century

142
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
So bill would be there you know working in

143
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,063
And its economy seemed a little anemic a little slow

144
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,903
He could make more loans you can make it easier for people to borrow money

145
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,047
And if the economy seemed a little overheated maybe saw bubble out there on the horizon he could make it harder

146
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,071
For people to borrow money

147
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
It was an incredible amount of power

148
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
And having all of this power

149
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
Put Biddle at the center of this

150
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
Small Club of elite or running

151
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
America

152
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
And he is

153
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
Great friends with

154
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
All the all the presidents

155
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,503
With atoms with with Madison

156
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,063
Then you can see even just threw his

157
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
Diary writing

158
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
He he loved being this big

159
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
He loved being a banker so much

160
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
You are the poem

161
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
Granny

162
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
There's a couple

163
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,399
I prefer my last letter from bearings or hope

164
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
Berrington helper bags

165
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,311
I prefer my last letter from bearings or hope to the finest Epistles of Plenty or Pope

166
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
Who are writers

167
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
If is Pliny

168
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
Pliny the Elder

169
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,735
Don't know he was not much of a poem

170
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,295
He was really good at banking Nicholas

171
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,855
Old school Beetle had found his face

172
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
Running the bank of United

173
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
He figured you do it forever

174
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
There was only one thing standing in his way

175
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
Andrew

176
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Jack's

177
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,911
As far as I can tell Jackson is the only person who would become president of the United

178
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
To Kill a Man In Cold Blood

179
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
This is HW Brands historian at the University of

180
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
He said

181
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,359
You know Jackson was not in biddle's

182
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,199
Clubwear you pal around with former presidents and write poems about Bank

183
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,783
Using the club of people who shot at each other in duel

184
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
He told us about this time that

185
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,391
Jackson demanded a duel from Charles Dickinson

186
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
A man would need the bad choice

187
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
Insulting Andrew Jackson

188
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
He

189
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
Stood

190
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Took a bullet

191
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
From Dickinson

192
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,399
The bullet lodged itself quite close to Jackson carpet just miss

193
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,471
Antarctica's Jackson with a skinny guy and he was wearing this order

194
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
Large Overcoat

195
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,615
And with that bullet next to his heart

196
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
Jackson level his piss

197
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
And

198
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Shot

199
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Charles Dickens

200
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
Mortally wounded him he died

201
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,039
Several hours later

202
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
Little people love

203
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
These kind of stories

204
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,903
About Andrew Jackson when he was the original

205
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
He could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue shoot somebody

206
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:02,047
And not lose voters

207
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
1828

208
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Yunnan

209
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
De Jackson is this

210
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
Is this really very controversial figure

211
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,519
Maybe best-known out for the poorest equate he treated Native American

212
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
But at the time

213
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,359
That was not the way people saw Jack

214
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
They saw this as this man of the people

215
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:22,015
And that he was bringing the people with him into the White House I'm quite

216
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
Literally know these stories about his inauguration

217
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
Party where there's

218
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
Skills of liquor and it's

219
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Crowded

220
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,743
When people are breaking Clipper like rushing the people bringing up the whiskey

221
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,351
Punch out at it's like knocking it over it got so out of hand had to move the whiskey punch

222
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,399
Out onto the front lawn just to get p

223
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
People out of the White House

224
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Classic solution

225
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
No more booze in the house

226
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,311
And what did he good populist Jackson did not like

227
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,895
In this particular case he even hated paper money

228
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,223
He thought the country should just be run on gold and silver

229
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
Which was not

230
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
Like some crazy friends viewer

231
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,159
I mean to get your head into it think about the way a lot of people feel now about

232
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Like all this

233
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Sketchy

234
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:06,047
Mortgage products that Banks cooked up in the housing bubble of the 2000s

235
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,375
That is how a lot of people thought about paper money

236
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,447
And for good cause I mean thanks for the 1800

237
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Would all the sudden

238
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
Just go out of business

239
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,335
And the bank. There are no use for gold the paper money would be worthless

240
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,687
To imagine them how Jackson felt about a bank of the United States

241
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
With special

242
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
Powers granted by the Federal Gov

243
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
It was a private bank

244
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
It had his own board of directors

245
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
And people increasingly thought

246
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
This

247
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
Sing the National Bank

248
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
Corroborated

249
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,791
At the behest of the government ought to be answerable to the government

250
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,863
But this Bank of the United States was not answerable to be

251
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
See if a President Who hates bags

252
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Who is

253
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,239
Literally killed another human being

254
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
And Nicholasville decide he's going to go visit him

255
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
And it's shockingly cordial

256
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,199
Jackson says the Biddle here's the quote

257
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
I do not dislike your bank any more than all

258
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,855
Another widget not personal I just think what you do is it

259
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,903
Total scam that is bad for America

260
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
Evan Biddle says

261
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,743
Well I'm very much gratified at this

262
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Frank

263
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Explanation

264
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
In other words

265
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,631
Thanks for not shooting me let's not do this kind of meeting ever again

266
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
And then after the meeting

267
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,471
Little Spike telling his friend about you

268
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,055
He called Jackson's ideas about banking

269
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Quote

270
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
Be honest

271
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,687
The erroneous Notions of one who intends well

272
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,247
In other words I take Jackson seriously

273
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
But not literally

274
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
But they don't know

275
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Trouble is

276
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
The bank of the United States

277
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
It has to be

278
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
We authorized every 20

279
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
Just to stay in business

280
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,047
Congress has to pass a bill and the president has to sign it into law

281
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
Otherwise the bank is done

282
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
It's a Biddle comes up

283
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,191
With this plant he is going to go on

284
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Defensive

285
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,543
Key figures people are kind of like in the Bank of the United States

286
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,919
Jackson's up for re-election I'm going to push this bill now get it quickly before Congress and

287
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,503
Put pressure on Andrew Jackson to renew my precious picture

288
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575
So Biddle pull together this Army of

289
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
Supporters Inc

290
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
You know powerful politician

291
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Well connect

292
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
Did politicians and he's like his

293
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Stop

294
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
Player in Congress

295
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,815
Is the senator for Massachusetts

296
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Daniel Webb

297
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
If you were alive in the 1820s

298
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
You would be so

299
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Excited right now

300
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,519
When Daniel Webster Rose to speak

301
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
Washington stopped

302
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
Doing what it was doing

303
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
People flock to the Senate

304
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,711
To listen to Daniel Webster it was high drama

305
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,015
It was wonderful entertainment and

306
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
You could be educated in the process

307
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
What people didn't General Lee know

308
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
Was that

309
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,415
Daniel Webster was on a retainer

310
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
With the bank of the United

311
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,255
He was getting paid by the bankers

312
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,327
Yeah he's getting paid by Nicholas Biddle person

313
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
Too well to represent the bank

314
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
While he was a senator

315
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
For Massachusetts

316
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
Is that legal

317
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
What's that legal could you do that

318
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
It wasn't illegal

319
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,943
So the great order and paid shill

320
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Daniel Webster Rises

321
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Just to speak

322
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
He says many of you

323
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
Many few including

324
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,391
President do not like Banks printing all of this paper money in

325
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
I got it

326
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
You want safe and sound money

327
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
He said

328
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Okay

329
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,559
If you want safe and sound money

330
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
And who doesn't

331
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
The bank of United

332
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
What states is good

333
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,447
Pause off the bank of the US is your friend

334
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,287
The bank of us is a cautious conservative Bank

335
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:34,687
It doesn't just run around printing paper money like crazy in fact it rains in all of those States

336
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
He says

337
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
And I do quote

338
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
In the absence of a bank of the United States

339
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:44,927
The State Banks become effectively The Regulators of the public currency

340
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,023
Their numbers their capital and the interest connected with them

341
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
Give him a power

342
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
Which nothing

343
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
Is competent

344
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
To control

345
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,727
In other words Webster sing if you think the bank of the United States is Shady and out of control

346
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
You should see the statement

347
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
And

348
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
Send it

349
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,687
Congress passes a law to give bittles Bank another 20 years of life

350
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
Beetles in Washington DC for the event

351
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,087
And he gets cheered inside the capital E throws a party that goes late Into the Night

352
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
And then

353
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
On July 4th

354
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,231
As it happens 1832 that bill lands on Jackson

355
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
Desk for him to sign into law

356
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
Jackson looks at it

357
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
That is it for a moment

358
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
And says

359
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Oh hell no

360
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,983
Go to direct quote with Jackson does veto the bill

361
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
Who writes this famous

362
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
Veto message like this

363
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
Populist.

364
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
That says in park

365
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
When the laws make the rich

366
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,223
Witcher and the potent more powerful

367
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,039
The Humble members of society have a right to come

368
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,087
Plane of the Injustice of their

369
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,415
The bank of the United States will be no more

370
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
And Biddle

371
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
Actually thinks at this moment

372
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,303
Got him right where I walked her

373
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
He thinks this veto is going to

374
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,399
Off Jackson the election he called him like

375
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
Panther biting at the bars

376
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Cajun

377
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,079
Pays to reprint thousands of copies of this veto message to use as like an attack ad

378
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
Auntie mescal

379
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
People love the

380
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:13,247
Papito beloved The veto message right the humble members of society

381
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
People's president overruling a corrupt Congress

382
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,367
The fight elite bankers and you cannot lose with that

383
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
Jackson wins re-election in a landslide

384
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
5 years later

385
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
The economy of the United States

386
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Is completely destroyed

387
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
Yeah

388
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
About that

389
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,679
Literally stuff to Daniel Webster was paid to say

390
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
It all came to pass

391
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
After the bank of the United States disappeared

392
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
The government had to find a place to

393
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
To put

394
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
It's money

395
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,967
Jackson publicity was says okay let's send the money out all the

396
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
State bags

397
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
State Banks all over the

398
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,623
The State Bank start lending money like crazy printing paper money

399
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:56,255
Fueling this massive land boom that turns into a massive bubble which means more loans

400
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,303
More money people buy more land

401
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,143
Andrew Jackson's like wait wait wait this was not the plan I wanted to list

402
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Paper money

403
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,215
Soap so he make this last minute

404
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Change

405
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,055
It requires that some land purchases be made

406
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Not with paper money

407
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
But with gold

408
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
Yeah but nobody has gold XL there is this

409
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:19,039
Panic it is the biggest financial crisis in US history to this

410
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,111
The economy crash is so hard

411
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
The government itself

412
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
Can't get its gold out of

413
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
And this isn't

414
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,999
Just a financial prop

415
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,047
This is an entire economic

416
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,631
Cyclops people lose their jobs there's not enough money around

417
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
In fact

418
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,031
Researchers have gone back and they figured out that children who were born during the panic of 1837

419
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
Grew up to be shorter

420
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
10 people who were born before

421
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Caramel nurse

422
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
The Panic caused them to go hungry

423
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Ask Nicholas Biddle

424
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
She had to watch

425
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Not only this Christ

426
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Display out around him

427
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,695
But here to watch his bank his organization that you built crumble

428
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
To nothing

429
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
The bank of the United States

430
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
Glorious building in Philly

431
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
Get a new name

432
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,375
The bank of the United States

433
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Of

434
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Couch

435
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
Just another state bank now

436
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
Just another State Bank

437
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,287
And even that goes bust in

438
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:17,151
Cordelia Biddle told me that at the end Nicholas Biddle this manhood

439
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
How the round with presidents

440
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
He just kind of disappeared from public life

441
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,551
It mean it really is a very sad and because

442
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Here's this man who

443
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,391
Who felt that he devoted his life to his country

444
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
And he's

445
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Send packing

446
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
It's

447
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,791
It's it's terrible

448
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
For the next seventy years

449
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
United States goes from panic

450
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,239
And even after the United States government created a true Central Bank

451
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
The Federal Reserve in the early 1900

452
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
Even then

453
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
This fight

454
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
Continuing something

455
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
I think

456
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
I think that's because of something really

457
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Central

458
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,295
About money itself

459
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Your money is

460
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,647
Is like this utility we all need it

461
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
We all use it

462
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
It's created by the devil

463
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
But

464
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,255
You need more than just

465
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
Every successful economy has private Banks

466
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
It's the market

467
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
Bitconnect savers

468
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Borrowers

469
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:15,775
Decide who should get a loan and this gives Banks dislike spooky power over our lives

470
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
They control money

471
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,407
Freak. Jackson freaks out people to the Safeway

472
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,247
You know you see today's famous senator from

473
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren

474
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,623
Arguing with some Bank CEO and it feels connected

475
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,719
Right after doing the story I don't think anymore oh this is just some like

476
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,023
Temporary fight that's happening because of the financial

477
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
You know I don't think there's some

478
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
Utopia are some steady state even where everybody's like oh wait the government's going to get this power over money and

479
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
And things are going to get

480
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
That power over money

481
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
And it's done we worked it out

482
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,895
I don't think that I think this fight over money between the government and Banks

483
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
This is our system

484
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,479
The bank war is never going

485
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:09,791
Evergreen history story has a small foot

486
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:16,191

491
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,327
Banking in the early part of the nineteenth

492
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887

What does number one

501
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,439
It is an enduring mystery how a president like Andrew Jackson

502
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
Who created paper money

503
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
Got his face on the $20 bill

504
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327
We Believe Nicholas Biddle would have been a better choice

505
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
He thought that he was

506
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Very handsome

507
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,263
Do you think he was handsome

508
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
For the.

509
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
Yes

510
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,479
I don't even know what that means

511
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
Footnote number 2

512
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,647
When you're talking to historian about this show and you want to sound smart

513
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,975
And you well you should refer to biddle's bank at the second

514
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
Bank of the United

515
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,583
Cuz America tried this whole thing before with the first

516
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
I think the United States

517
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,679
Existed from 1791 to 1811

518
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
We would have told you that story about it

519
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Less interest

520
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
Not necessarily

521
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,359
Failed to get retarded by single vote in the Senate

522
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
Footnote number 3

523
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Our last foot

524
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
Regarding

525
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
The panic of 1837

526
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,575
There's a book I read a working on the show called The Mini

527
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,111
Panic of 1837

528
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,439
We put the fact that there was a lot going on we didn't talk about all that.

529
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,559
You don't contributing factors included changes in credit in England

530
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,959
One historian has argued that actually changing demand for opium in China contributed to the panic

531
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,263
I don't understand exactly what it has to do with

532
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,567
Silver from Mexico and Britain

533
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,383
Trade with India I don't know that's amazing

534
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
We keeping the week

535
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,479
But it certainly fair to say that the end of the second Bank of the US

536
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,783
Played an important role in the Panama

537
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
I'm Jacob

538
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:50,047
I Roberts babe thanks for listening
