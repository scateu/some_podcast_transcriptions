12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,256
Know this guy

13
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,792
Interview come back in 2015

14
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,608
The heat is intensifying on President Trump

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:43,008
And his personal lawyer Michael Cohen after one of your business partners evgeny Friedman

16
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,080
When is the taxi King cut a deal with prosecutors

17
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,128
Veil of saying taxi cab

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,688
I understand that because it is an amazing

19
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,480
Concept and the News broke last night

20
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,528
The Friedman the taxi King has

21
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
Reportedly agreed

22
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
Help out state

23
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,624
And federal prosecutors in their

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,000
It's not clear if those investigations are related to Cohen still the question looming large

25
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
Could the deal give prosecutors more leverage to get Cohen to flip on President Trump

26
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:15,520
Surprising that the taxi King finds himself in the midst of this whole drama with

27
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
President Trump and

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312

Remarkably successful

100
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
Add buying up these rare precious

Over billion dollars

106
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
But the taxi business is of course

107
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
Changing a lot right

108
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
Used to have to wait for a cab in New York you have to run out and hail it was terrible at it there's a definite article

109
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,408
The first time I've successfully hailed a cab I felt like a real New York

110
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,504
But now all I do is pull out my phone and go to Uber or Lyft

111
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
And

112
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,344
Lo and behold some guy in a hot dishes up a couple minutes later to

113
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
Take me wherever I want

114
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,488
And because of that guy the value of the old fashioned taxi medallions

115
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512

Joseph MI

163
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,271
Friedman grew up in New York but was working in Russia at the time

164
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
He was a high Finance guy

165
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
And when you heard about

166
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
His dad's heart attack

167
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903

Waiting outside with taxis and thanks son

173
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,143
Son this could all be yours

174
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,471
But the thing is Friedman didn't want it to all be his

175
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,543
He sort of thought of taxis is this grubby business

176
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
They were dirty that was smelly

177
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
They were small

178
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
And more than that

179
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,711
Cabs back in those days were run like a mama

180
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
You save up money to buy a cab

181
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,063
Or get a small business loan and buy a

182
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Couple or few

183
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
This was the way Friedman's dad

184
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
But the song Gene Friedman

185
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
He was a finance guy

186
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
And he thought we damn it

187
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
The middle

188
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
The Medallion

189
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,655
If you buy a medallion you are basically buying part

190
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Of a monopoly

191
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,239
The city isn't making any more of

192
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
The medallions are like gold or real estate

193
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
And yes they're

194
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
But Friedman new bankers

195
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
He knew he could get big love

196
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
And interest only loan

197
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
What's with super low rates

198
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,575
And he told his father you could use this borrowed money to get more and more and more

199
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,623
What could go wrong

200
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,695
Although his dad had a pretty good idea of what cookie

201
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,327
Diamond where it says you're an idiot he says you don't know what you're talkin about this is not the way things are done

202
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,655
This is not what you want to do and yet it was exactly what

203
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
Friedman wanted to

204
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
He borrowed money

205
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
He bought medallion

206
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,799
And then he bought more money and he bought more medallion

207
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,383
Anyone the price went up use those medallions as collateral

208
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
To get even more love

209
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
And Muhammad Ali

210
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,319
She was basically doing what Lehman Brothers and other people on Wall Street did right before the Finish

211
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,647
Crash massive amounts of money to buy assets

212
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,951
That they believed could only go up

213
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,767
He was a one-man Medallion hedge fund

214
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
He could not get enough medallion

215
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
And you can just bid for them

216
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
He bragged about

217
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
Overbidding

218
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,239
If the last Medallion in some sort of blind auction went for like

219
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
$100,000

220
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
He go up to a hundred and ten

221
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,127
Yeah the guy pays 400k

222
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
He paid for it

223
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,711
And that is when he started naming them after

224
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
Drinking at the time or his

225
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
Favorite vacation spot aarhus

226
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,903
Lady friend garages for taxis gas station

227
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Keep them fuel

228
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Infrastructure

229
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
This is my hump

230
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
This is where

231
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
We are new calves are born

232
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,727
An old Cavs come to die

233
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,311
He shows us around his garage and inside our guys

234
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
16 meters

235
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,407
Pulling stickers off old taxi putting a new one

236
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Kyle

237
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
The yellow part

238
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
Everywhere

239
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
Taxi cab

240
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
The secret Friedman says

241
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,903
Is to make sure that he never see The Medallion Taxi

242
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
Just sitting around in the garage

243
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Because then it's not out on the street

244
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Not making money

245
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,559
Emily Spotswood he has hey why is this year

246
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,095
Page 121

247
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959
Go to work

248
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
Yeah he's going to go to work

249
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,567
So when I first heard how much people were paying for it

250
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Dalian

251
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
More than a million dollars

252
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,919
I thought that this can't possibly work

253
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
How can one tax

254
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
DeKalb pulling enough money

255
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
To pay off

256
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
$1000000

257
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,903
It doesn't seem right it does not seem right and yet the manager the garage locksmith

258
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,719
Joe Cresta Novak says it is all about

259
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Generating

260
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
Steady ink

261
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,327
Bereavement rent all of his calves by the day

262
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
Eeyore by the way

263
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Themes of Drive

264
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
One guy take the day shift work

265
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Makeshift

266
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
When driver gets out

267
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Next one gets in

268
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
They get used to each other

269
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,055
Smell

270
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
They know everything

271
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
Always warm

272
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Nicorette

273
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
The drivers pay a set amount of money

274
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Eugene Friedman

275
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,831
Where do they get a grape fair to the airport or whether nobody held them down the whole ship

276
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,647
It does not matter how many people get into their cab because

277
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,719
The drivers pay the same rent every time

278
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,815
Depends what car you get anywhere between 100 and 100

279
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
25

280
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
But all day for the whole day 24 hours

281
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,751
Usually I first texted you I will come on between 2 and 300 today

282
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:24,127
You don't like to think of cabs as these little yellow machines that just spit out money all day long

283
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
$125 a day

284
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,735
$45,000 a year per cap

285
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Like clockwork

286
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,319
And as long as that income coming off that cab

287
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,903
Is Morgan Freeman have to Fork over to pay off The Medallion loans

288
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
He's good he's making a profit

289
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,487
This is why finances

290
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,559
Because if you can get a cheap loan to buy a taxi

291
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Dalian

292
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,399
As long as you're paying a low-interest-rate you will make a profit

293
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,215
It's like getting a cheap mortgage for an apartment building

294
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,519
As long as you have renters paying every month

295
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
You're good

296
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,591
Prima basically built a taxicab Empire

297
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
He started by Captain Chicago in Boston

298
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
Philly people started referring to him

299
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Taxi cab

300
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
So this is clearly the right

301
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
This is the rise yes

302
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
So I imagine that mean

303
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Means we are close

304
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
The fall

305
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
Which is of course why week

306
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,511
Friedman and you know we always talk about

307
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Bubbles

308
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Right

309
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,119
But when you're actually looking at it happening

310
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
It's not always the way it works

311
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
Sex with the taxi industry

312
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,495
It's less of a pop and more of this

313
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
Sloe crumble

314
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
The first crack

315
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
The first crack is

316
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
Uber shows up

317
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
In York City of

318
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,967
Friedman he tried to show that he wasn't sober

319
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
It was no big deal

320
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
You know what there's nobody that's a bigger fan of uber than I

321
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,647
And I will save you know if they're worth 50 billion dollars

322
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,695
And somebody can recognize that you know what

323
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
I know maybe

324
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
Maybe I'm worth something also

325
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,815
Yeah I don't think he's really that big of a

326
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
Yeah he is trying to show a sort of

327
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,447
Bravado in the face of adversity in effect

328
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,263
As I talk to him longer and longer he would just

329
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
Keep putting these little jobs at Uber

330
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
Where he be like you know Uber is just

331
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,407
For the 1% taxi cabs are for the people

332
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
And

333
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,015
You know call an Uber you don't know if it's going to show up you don't know how much they're going to charge

334
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Because clearly

335
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,159
Uber bugs Hamid bugs him that their customers

336
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,207
Who prefer calling an Uber

337
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
Just sitting in one of his Yellow Taxi

338
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,327
But the real problem for freedmen with Uber is actually not

339
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
About the customers

340
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,679
It's about the drivers the guys who rent the taxi cabs from Friedman

341
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,287
That is how he makes all of his money and those guys have been going over to Uber to

342
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,383
Sofritas had to start lowering the fee he charges everyday to rent out his Taxi

343
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
And that means less money coming in

344
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
Even that Friedman says

345
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Heekin

346
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,391
Live with that he can make a little less than the drivers he can maybe in some perfect world coexist with Uber

347
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,207
But the thing that might just kill him

348
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
Is the thing that helped

349
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Build his business

350
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
The finance

351
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
The bank

352
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
The banks

353
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
It was cheap loans that freedmen took out those are coming due and suddenly the banks are getting nervous the same people who gave

354
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,287
A Freedman a bunch of money over the years

355
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Are saying

356
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
Hey maybe we shouldn't give you any money

357
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Financing

358
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,247
The financing is in there is because you have a bunch of Steel bankers

359
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Right

360
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:15,647
And these are guys that are extremely good friends of mine these are the guys that have made me

361
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
Financing in Bangkok

362
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
Have made me horny

363
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
But you know what they stop financing

364
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
Liquidity

365
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
Has dried

366
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,631
You can understand where the banks are coming from

367
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
They were lending Friedman money based on the Rarity of the taxi medallions those precious taxi medallion

368
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,847
But now if you could operate something that works

369
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Pretty much exactly like attacks

370
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
Without a medallion

371
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,223
The banks are figuring that these medallions

372
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Are not worth it

373
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,855
Stacy as I was listening to Jeanne Freedmen's woes I just kept

374
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
Flashing back to the financial crisis

375
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:54,303
The housing bubble collapsed because he talked about the same sort of things you know it's all about the value of them

376
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,119
The Medallion nobody knows what the value of the medallions are

377
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Because remember

378
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
He used to have

379
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,007
A billion dollars where the medallions are they sold from million each

380
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,151
But now nobody wants to buy nobody wants to sell the market for Medallion his shutdown and

381
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
If you could have changed hands

382
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
Have done so

383
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
For something like 800

384
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
Thousand

385
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
Dollars

386
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Witches

387
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,599
Way below what Freeman paid for

388
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:22,463
And just like happened in the housing crisis the banks are starting to foreclose on the taxi medallion

389
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,023
Infact Citibank is in court right now

390
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,351
Trying to foreclose on 46 of Freeman's medallion

391
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,679
They have names like hypnotic taxi and bombshell Taxi

392
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
He's always got a clever name even when he's in trouble

393
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,335
And Friedman has responded by filing bankruptcy on

394
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,895
Just the legal entities that own the medallion

395
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
It's getting really messy

396
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
So perhaps with is parallel to the financial crisis

397
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,319
It is not surprising what Friedman did this

398
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
Spring

399
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:54,463
He basically said the taxi industry is too big to fail any publicly proposed

400
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
They perhaps

401
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
The city of New York

402
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Should bail out

403
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
It's Yellow Cab industry

404
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
He said basically

405
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191
We were promised the Monopoly we are promised regulation

406
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
In the city of New York has a protector

407
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:11,103
Did that until his suggestion was you know maybe the city could guarantee the loans

408
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,919
Shinichi maybe the city could help the money start flowing again

409
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,735
We want our franchise War

410
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
Are pop-up

411
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
Are mama

412
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
R Big Brother

413
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
The city of New York the city of New York

414
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
Interested in us

415
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,231
Having a vested interest in moving forward

416
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
And doing what we need to do

417
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,375
It's a little bit hard for taxpayers who had a hard time swallowing

418
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,935
Some of the support of the banking industry

419
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,007
Altering their crisis but supporting the taxi industry

420
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
Might be too far for some

421
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
What is unsupported it sucks but it support listening

422
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
Yorkies have a vested interest

423
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
In

424
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
Yellow Taxi Cab

425
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
You need tok

426
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,527
Taxi cab picking people up at the airport

427
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
Movie tourist trap

428
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
What do you mean

429
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
Do you really need taxi cabs

430
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,207
Uber is creeping in everywhere and in fact

431
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,559
There was a move in the New York City Council to try and cap the number of Uber's in New York

432
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
And it just

433
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Fields

434
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Calculator

435
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
Even Friedman's ex-wife

436
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
She uses Uber

437
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,495
Of course she

438
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,567
I do this because his eleven-year-old son showed up

439
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
At the very beginning of the inner ear

440
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,151
I don't know he's my kid because

441
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,479
He just came over here in a cab I think was 5 in 56

442
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
And his mother

443
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,391
Said you can take an Uber because I feel more comfortable and he said I'm not getting into an Uber

444
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,207
Because it's a family business I'm taking a Yellow Cab

445
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
So that's how I know he's my kid

446
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
Is that true

447
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
You don't take the Ubers

448
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
I don't like

449
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
Why not

450
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,167
Only maybe maybe to the airport Maybe

451
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
Just maybe but

452
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,775
Ya must be particularly hard for Freeman because

453
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Right now

454
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,919
He's still making money he still making a lot of money all these cats

455
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
Are still out on the roads

456
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,503
It's not like they're put them away in some garage or something

457
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,807
Ugly 24 hours a day in New York

458
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
And he's got plenty of drivers who are still willing to

459
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
To pay him by

460
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
The day and by the week

461
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
The pleasure of driving those caps

462
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,047
Freedmen's real problem is that he borrowed too much money

463
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,887
The freedmen had been doing business like his daddy done business

464
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
He would be fine

465
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,495
He's got all those big loans from those big nervous Banks

466
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,031
And he is at their Mercy

467
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
We never listen to

468
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
You know if this all goes

469
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
South 14th

470
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
If it sort of the worst case scenario

471
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,991
If you have to sell his beloved medallions

472
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,319
Or if they get foreclosed upon and suddenly medallion

473
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
What the market

474
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
The truth is

475
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
Somebody is going to buy them

476
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,463
Are you going to be at

477
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,767
Much much lower price but

478
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,911
Taxi medallions will be bought they will be riveted on the some yellow car in a garage somewhere in Queens

479
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,495
And the medallions will be right back where they've always been

480
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
On the streets of New York

481
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:54,175
Looking for fares

482
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,575
Okay the show was recorded back in 2000

483
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,135
15 three years later now what

484
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Taxi King been up to

485
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,719
What's the easy stuff first

486
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
It has been a rough

487
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
3 years

488
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
Financially free

489
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,119
He did not get a bailout from New York City

490
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,703
Citibank did foreclosed on a bunch with medallions

491
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
And

492
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
His divorce

493
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
It was finalized

494
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
Then there's the bigger

495
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,359
The source of Gene Friedman Fortune

496
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
His medallion

497
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
The price of the medallions has

498
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Plummeted

499
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,271
You can get a New York City taxicab medallion

500
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,831
For under $200,000

501
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,135
Although I would not recommend it at this

502
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,207
And then there's the big stuff that came out yesterday

503
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
The tax stuff

504
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,023
The reason that Jim Friedman in the news right now

505
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,327
So here's what went down

506
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,679
When you get into a New York City taxicab there's a bunch of little fees that they hit you with

507
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,239
And you're too pretty General Q's Friedman

508
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,287
Of not paying a $0.50 charge

509
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
To the government

510
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
Even though it scabs

511
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Collected it

512
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,431
Accused of stealing $5000000 of these little fees

513
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,223
And he was facing big

514
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Prison time

515
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
We don't know

516
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
Exactly what the deal is

517
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
Between the taxi King

518
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
And prosecute

519
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,391
But we do know that yesterday

520
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,975
He pleaded guilty to lesser charges he will not see jail time

521
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
And

522
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,815
Many people are reporting that he has agreed to assist

523
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,631
State and federal prosecutors in their investigation

524
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,447
We texted the taxi King earlier today

525
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,287
But by the time we put out this episode he still had not gotten back to

526
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:38,623
Let us know what you thought of Today Show You Can Eat Ellis Planet Money at NPR.

LRG Athleta money I'm at Radio Smithville you Stacy

529
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,751
