1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,536
Hey it's Nick.

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,608
Today I got up at 4 in the morning

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,888
Biking to work

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,680
And pulled up a livestream

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,264
Have a news conference in Sweden morning everyone and

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,824
Welcome to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,896
Today is like the Superbowl for economist

8
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,432
Or more accurately

9
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,224
Econ Nobel.

10
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,552
Or even more accurately the Ellis medicine expire

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:27,136
PCA Columbus

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:31,232
About to announce

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:37,888
William nordhaus

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,448
We know that guy

15
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,776
We did a show about one of his papers back in 2014

16
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:48,128
And today he won the prize for his work on climate change

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,712
Now he shares the prize with Paul Romer

18
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
Of NYU

19
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
His work

20
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,296
Is about how economies grow

21
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:59,648
Or as the committee said integrating technological innovations

22
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,952
In the long run macroeconomics

23
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
Analysis

24
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
So today to celebrate the winners we are going to replay that episode we did with Bill nordhaus a few years

25
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
Years ago.

26
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,960
Long before there were light bulbs

27
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
There was fat

28
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,592
For thousands of years if you wanted to light up your cave your mud hut or

29
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,640
If you were really lucky Your Castle

30
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,176
You had to find some fat

31
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,712
Something to use for a wick

32
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
Maybe some more

33
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
Fabric

34
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,832
This was not easy

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
Even today

36
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
It's a hard way to get low

37
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,048
Yeah hi do you sell

38
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
Fat Moody fat

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
No

40
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,144
No I don't carry. No

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,424
Okay thanks very much

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
A high

43
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
Giselle love fat like beef fat

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Suet

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
Okay

46
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,408
Thanks Rich

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,736
Yeah hi I do so

48
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,528
Beef fat

49
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
How much is that

50
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
298 a pound

51
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
Okay great thanks very much you're welcome

52
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
I got to lb

53
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
Big nasty lump of fat

54
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,280
Came from around the couch kidney

55
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,096
I got some twine from the hardware store

56
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
And I went home to my Apartments have

57
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
TriMet candle

58
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592
Google harder to catch up then

59
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
You might think

60
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
Sticks to itself

61
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
I put the fat on the stove

62
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
It's pretty melted

63
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
Smells really

64
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
Nasty

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,488
Animal nasty

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
Stranded then I started dipping the Wicks into it

67
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,120
Dipping dipping

68
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,472
You have to let the fat dry when you have to dip the wick some more

69
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
Dipping

70
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
Was Eddie

71
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,336
I don't know 45 minutes or so of dipping

72
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Dip

73
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,688
Deal I got kind of dip crazy in there

74
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
Deal

75
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
After hours of work

76
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,184
Not counting raising the cow or killing the cow or making the twine

77
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
I had fixed

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Tiny

79
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
Crooked

80
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,280
Smelly candles

81
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm taking Golden State and I'm David kestenbaum today on the show

82
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
Story of how we got from dim little candles made out of cow fat to as much light as we want at the flick of a switch

83
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,408
And I don't think I'm exaggerating here this one little story

84
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,808
It explains why we are where we are today by billions of people don't have to worry about starving today while we aren't also

85
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
Assistance Farmers why we can't afford to have artist massage therapist and plumbers and yes radio reporter

86
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,608
Doing stories about the history of light

87
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,752

Jacob you brought these scraggly little candles in the office I'm holding him up here they look

98
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
Gnarled

99
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,687
They're definitely not straight and they're not like

100
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,759
Sleek looks like some mold has grown on

101
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
On a string

102
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
String

103
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,159
So you brought these candles in the office here and we wanted to show them to

104
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
An expert

105
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
We sat down with this woman Jane Brock

106
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,815
Jane wrote a book called brilliant the evolution of artificial light

107
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
So I made a few different candles

108
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
I tried

109
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
Beautiful Disaster

110
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
In the in the olden days

111
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,711
If a mother was trying to teach your daughter to make candles

112
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,783
She would not be pleased with these candles

113
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
But we'll see what happens

114
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,135
I was afraid when we let these things that we might set off

115
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
The fire alarm or the

116
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,511
Sprinkler system in the office I mean that is how weird it is to have light from fire

117
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,071
I was afraid we weren't going to be able to light him at all

118
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
It's just

119
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Beef fat and wine

120
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
But we pulled out a lighter

121
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,519
We have we have lights

122
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,871
That should we see how long it lasts

123
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,943
It's not pretty but I'm very impressed

124
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,551
Beautiful colors we would have been nice yellow flame wouldn't you say

125
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
Duty made a candle

126
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,391
Jane says that the quest

127
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
For this for

128
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
Something that gives you light

129
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
After the sun goes down

130
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
Go people to do all kinds of

131
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
In the United States in the Pacific Northwest

132
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
Native Americans used dried

133
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
Salmon

134
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,959
Basically made a salmon candle

135
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,543
In the tropics people would catch fireflies and try to make

136
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
A firefly Lantern

137
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
And then there's this bird called the petrol

138
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
The storm Petrel

139
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
And then north of Scotland where they would just

140
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,271
At which is a very oily seabird

141
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,575
Which they catch and dry

142
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,183
And thread a wick down its throat and then light it and

143
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
And that was a lamp

144
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,559
Chiron a dead bird without a table

145
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,959
And I would imagine they'd have a little storage area with a lot of dead dogs vegetables

146
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
Martha we need another petrol

147
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:44,223
The petrol supply is getting low displays of making light where all

148
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
A huge hassle

149
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
They took a lot of work

150
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,623
It was not just that I didn't know what I was doing when I made those candles

151
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,183
The writer Harriet Beecher Stowe said

152
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
Making candles from animal fat with

153
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
7 times as bad as washing clothes I mean think about it you got to get a cow you got a raise the calorie going to have food

154
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,471
Feed the cow you got to kill the cow you got to get the fat out of the couch

155
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
You got to put the fat in your Cuisinart

156
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,591
Which isn't going to be invented for a hundred years

157
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,175
From an economic perspective if you want to try to quantify how much of

158
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,015
Pain in the butt it is to make something or at least how hard it is to get that thing

159
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
You can ask a simple question

160
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,855
How much does it cost

161
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,183
Bill nordhaus Anaconda Misty yellow while back got obsessed with a

162
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,047
This question he decided he wanted to calculate exactly how expensive light was

163
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Thousands of

164
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
And how that cost change.

165
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,215
Because light you know light is this thing Society has needed and sought

166
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Forever

167
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
It was a way to track progress

168
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,823
Not just in light but in all kinds of

169
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
Unfortunately in order to do this

170
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,967
He needed to know how much things cost thousands of years ago

171
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
Like an ancient babel

172
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
Was even trailers numbers exist

173
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
But they did

174
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
I ran into a woman at Yale

175
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,439
And she believe it or not

176
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
Huey is just

177
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,255
Unbelievable actually

178
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,839
She actually had wage data and price data

179
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
From

180
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
The Babylonian era

181
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,727
4000 years ago

182
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,055
Now he has these numbers but he needs to know one other thing

183
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
How much light are people getting for their money

184
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
In ancient Babylon people used lamp

185
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
4 light

186
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
So nordhaus

187
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Decided to make

188
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,831
I did this in my dining room

189
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Where else

190
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,927
Devised an ancient style lamp from catalog he gets it burning

191
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,535
Measure how bright it is he borrows a light meter from a facility sky at Yale

192
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,327
And he does some science

193
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,167
And that would just measure it then write it down

194
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
It's the way you see in the

195
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,799
In the old movies are some guy with in his lab coat running down the measurements

196
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
Jacob

197
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,431
I'd little note here I happen to be taking nordhaus has economics class right around this time

198
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
Which I was a was a pretty serious

199
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,503
Like a no-nonsense class

200
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,903
And it's so funny for me to think that night he was going home and measuring ancient lamp placement is dining room with a light

201
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:05,279
Who does this the light meter the ancient lamp numbers but now

202
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
You have to

203
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:10,143
Figure out a way to compare the price of light over thousands of years

204
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
So here's one measure heat

205
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
If you take

206
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
A day's wages

207
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
You work all day you take all the money or not

208
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
And you spend it online

209
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
How many minutes

210
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
Could you light up a small

211
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
With as much light as you get from

212
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
Today's Modern Life

213
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
You're the answer for ancient Babylon

214
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
Maybe 10 minutes

215
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
It was really expensive

216
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,207
An entire day's wages got you the equivalent of

217
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,511
10 minutes of light from a kind of dim light

218
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,815
Economist talked a lot about product is

219
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
How much one person camper

220
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Produce with a date

221
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,959
And the answer was not much

222
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
Everything was hot

223
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,335
Growing food was hard making candles for instance took hours

224
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,687
Fat which by the way was expensive because raising animals

225
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,551
This was a world where when the sun went down almost everyone lived in the dark

226
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
And this might sound sort of romantic

227
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
But basically it was awful

228
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,463
The dark was not some beautiful thing you went out and

229
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
Explore it was Danger

230
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
It was something that trap

231
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
In Paris

232
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
At one point

233
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:17,727
It was actually a law that said every night everybody has to give their keys to a magistrate go home and lock themselves

234
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
For basically 4000 years

235
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Very little

236
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,871
With lights over the economy in general

237
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
Most people work all day

238
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Naked women

239
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
The way things get better

240
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,063
The way an economy grows the way people get richer is that

241
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,879
Someone comes up with a better way to do some

242
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
A way to take a little less work

243
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:41,535
Overtime there are small improvements in life and in light

244
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,119
The Romans figure out how to make a lamp that's a little more efficient

245
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,727
People start use whale oil this of course is very very bad for whales

246
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,591
But we don't have a lot of fat they were like these big swimming sources of fuel

247
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,919
Still even when you get all the way to the 1700s

248
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,759
Life still looks more like ancient Babylon than the modern world

249
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
People still travel the same way

250
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
My foot by horse by sailing ship

251
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
Most people are still subsistence farmer

252
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,951
Usually living in some kind of hot

253
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,999
Trying to grow enough food not to starve to death

254
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,559
Your career there are tiny games in Friday

255
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Little bits of a

256
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
But

257
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Not a lot

258
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
And Light

259
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,983
Light still comes from finding stuff that's lying around in

260
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Lighting it on fire

261
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
Again Economist bill nordhaus

262
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
You look at the picture

263
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
And what happened here

264
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
Its economic history in a nutshell

265
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,015
From Babylonian time to round 18

266
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,855
They were even though there were improvements as best we can tell

267
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
They were very modest

268
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,487
And then around 1800 in the lighting you can see it so clearly lighting

269
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
Just a

270
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Norms change

271
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
In the pace

272
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
Of improvement

273
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
What happens in the 1800's

274
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
Is a few things

275
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
We start to really actively

276
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
We try to discover

277
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
And around 1850 a guy in Canada

278
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,711
Comes up with something that's not just a slightly better Wick or a slightly more efficient lamp

279
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
It is this magical liquid

280
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,831
With the right techniques you can get it from coal or oil

281
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
This big breakthrough

282
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Harrison

283
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:17,023
Not cutting-edge now but back then says kerosene was a huge deal

284
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,095
When the first kerosene lamps came out it was

285
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,959
Is one yesterday and said it was the kind of oil people that dreamed about for centuries

286
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
It was brighter

287
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
It was cleaner

288
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
And importantly it was much cheaper

289
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
You work a day you got

290
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
About an hour

291
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
Whale oil

292
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,295
Kerosene you get

293
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
About

294
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
5 hours

295
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
Wow so it's about

296
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
5 *

297
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
More efficient

298
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Kerosene

299
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,535
Let the world and save the whales

300
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,839
So if kerosene was so great

301
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,399
Why did it take the world so long to find

302
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Science

303
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,031
This idea of professional scientists this idea.

304
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:04,383
There are lots of people who go to work every day at universities and do experiments

305
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
In the 1800

306
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
This is still a new thing

307
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:13,599
If you happen to be president of Yale University this is around the time when you're thinking you know maybe we should get one of those science

308
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,927
Why what why would they do in those experiments

309
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
A century earlier

310
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:23,327
Well you didn't have scientists A Century earlier they would teaching Greek

311
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
General teaching logic

312
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,191
Now all the scientists are working on better ways to make life

313
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
And life is getting cheaper

314
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
More people are using it

315
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,079
No more locking yourself in and huddling in the dark all night

316
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
Around this time street lights.

317
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
People start going out at night

318
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:43,807
So we have kerosene what's the next big Advance after that okay next big Advance after that is

319
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
The electric lamp

320
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
The big one

321
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,023
Well you might think so a Twist will be

322
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
I'll be back after this break

Cheetah Jacob I thought I knew the story of the light bulb you know Thomas Edison the great inventor

335
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
Story about science and Innovation you medicine

336
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:40,383
Trying all these different filaments these different designs and finally getting one little glow for hours but

337
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
This Eureka lightbulb moment

338
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
And it is not

339
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,271
It's not enough to get you to the world of really cheap light

340
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
Is Edison needed this other

341
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,647
He needed money she needed lots and lots of money

342
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Why

343
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,487
You can't light a light bulb without electricity

344
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
You needed to build a power play

345
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,631
Right now where the location of

346
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,935
The original Power Plant in lower Manhattan

347
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,239
This is Paul Israel is an Edison

348
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,543
Open scholar we met him here in New York City

349
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,591
We're standing in front of this plaque

350
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,663
Thomas Alva Edison in big letters and

351
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
There's this picture

352
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,063
And the image of a show is the generator room of the PowerPlay

353
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
With a bunch of guys in a really long mustaches

354
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
This is 1882

355
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,975
So what's of mustaches event

356
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
The money part of building a power plant is so important

357
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,423
When they finally get this historic thing completed in 1882 they get the power plant built

358
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
And they're ready to turn it on

359
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
Edison is not here

360
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
He's a few blocks away

361
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
A big impressive Stone build

362
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
Where today there is another plaque

363
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
So that you may have heard of

364
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
JPMorgan

365
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,991
It reads the capitalist capitalist

366
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
Known throughout the world of Finance

367
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
Sought out by presidents

368
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,391
Helped bankroll the industrialization of

369
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
Of America

370
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
Can write that I'm too many people

371
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
JP Morgan Bank and a bunch of investors

372
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
They put up money for the power

373
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,631
Pretty clear they built this great big expensive

374
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
Complicated powerstation the first

375
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,263
Central Power Station in the world right basically inventing

376
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
Electric light

377
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
And when they turn it on Edison is not there

378
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
Right he was

379
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,479
Where he needed to be with the people who had funded

380
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
The whole thing

381
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Right

382
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,599
To 3 p.m. on September 4th Edison flipped on the switch

383
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,391
Here at JP Morgan's office

384
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
And what happened

385
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,511
Acid lights all over the district

386
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
Per square mile of lower Manhattan

387
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
Some lady was lit by electricity

388
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
You think of Edison the inventor

389
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
Even more important

390
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
Is Edison the businessman

391
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,567
At the time buildings in lower Manhattan were running off gas light

392
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
And Edison knew that was who we had to be

393
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
We spent a lot of time thinking about economic

394
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,879
Constantly he's going through and comparing the cost of what he's doing to what the cost of gas system

395
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,951
You never think about that

396
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
Well that's what made him such a good innovator

397
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
Right cuz he he recognized

398
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,143
These economic questions were just as important

399
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
In designing what he did in laboratory

400
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:16,031
When you think of economic growth how much do you think of it is coming from like

401
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,103
Individual like Eureka moments and inventions

402
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
What's up I got and how much is it

403
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
Stuff around

404
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
Ability to finance

405
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,991
The economic structure

406
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,063
So most of it is actually the structure around

407
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,927
To light a square mile of lower Manhattan Edison needed the whole financial system

408
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,767
Hats away to protect his ideas so no one would steal them

409
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
He needed a company

410
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,631
Play a bunch of different investors could come together and risk money

411
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
A lot of money

412
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
To build a power plant

413
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,007
Play wire so you can try this crazy thing

414
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
Light Without fire

415
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,615
Edison comes along at a time when all this machinery

416
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,687
Cotton's corporations Banks is in place

417
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
They were consequences

418
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
Minos first power plants burn coal

419
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
And pollution was pretty bad

420
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,623
Edison built a huge power plant on the east side of Manhattan

421
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
And at some point the City Health Department got involved

422
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Is according

423
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
New York Times quote

424
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:13,119
When it was found Health Department men were trying to photograph the smokestacks Scouts were put on the company's roof

425
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,911
Order the feeding of coal stopped

426
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
Whenever photographers app

427
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,519
My other hand you know how to City lit up with cheap electric

428
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Trade off

429
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
Around this time

430
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
Everything is getting fat

431
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Cheaper

432
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
Scientist keep making noodle

433
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,223
Discoveries you get the internal combustion engine

434
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
The tractor

435
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,575
For the first time in human history most people don't have to work as farmers

436
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,647
This went on decade after decade all through the 20th

437
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
All continents got much cheaper

438
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Like light

439
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,047
And if you look at the really long Arc here it's

440
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
It's amazing

441
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
Mingle all the way back to the battle on

442
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Okay

443
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
Babylonians

444
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
Worked all day

445
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
You got the equivalent of

446
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
10 minutes

447
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,519
10 minutes of light

448
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,103
4000 years later in the 19th century with kerosene lamps

449
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Things are better

450
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
Does Labor get through 5 hour

451
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:02,527
And by the time nordhaus does his light study in the 1990s

452
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
If you work today

453
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
How much light do you get

454
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
Maybe 20 thousand

455
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
20000 hours

456
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,023
20000 hours

457
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
I mean you basically you you have your

458
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,495
You have your house lit up you have your streets lit up you have your all your

459
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,335
Equipment on you have your air conditioner on your all the stuff you're doing is

460
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,431
Your your saturated with lighting the main thing is your statue is like

461
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,223
Economic growth isn't all good

462
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,783
There's pollution their environmental consequences

463
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
But fundamentally

464
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,367
Growth is about things getting faster

465
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
Getting cheaper

466
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
Getting more efficient

467
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
About doing the same amount of

468
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
And being able to buy

469
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,791
20000 hours

470
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Light

471
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Instead of 10 minutes

472
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,143
And as a result about being able to work less

473
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
Where to buy other stuff

474
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
That used to be just for the wealthy

475
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
We can buy books

476
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
We can take vacation

477
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,847
Even today there are still people who go to work everyday

478
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,407
Try to figure out how to make a better life

479
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,783
This morning I went to the ball Factory

480
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,807
For about an hour

481
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:14,207
This is John Edmund he's one of the founders of a company called Creed they make LED light bulbs which of course are much

482
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
What's more efficient than regular Bowl

483
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:21,631
You'll make you you try an experiment you'll say holy crap we just got more light out of this thing

484
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
By using

485
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:26,239
This contact material or flipping the chip over

486
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,055
Jacob when we talk about economic growth every year you know

487
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,103
When we say the economy grew a couple percent

488
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,431
That happens because every day out there

489
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,223
Someone somewhere in some corner of

490
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,295
Economy has figured out how to do something a little bit better

491
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,319
A little bit faster

492
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
There are little Essex

493
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,951
And this process is going on year after year for hundreds of years

494
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,535
I want question I always have it when I think about this is like

495
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,119
And not just with light but this whole story of constant economic growth

496
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
Constant product

497
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Activity Improvement

498
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
My question is

499
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
Is it going to go on forever

500
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,031
Or some point we going to run out of ways to make things better

501
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
We might

502
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,103
We might double from where we are now

503
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,151
But we're not going to be tripling quadrupling it

504
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
Cuz there are physical limit

505
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,015
Honeywell cargo many miles an hour now

506
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
It just won't it just it's not going to happen

507
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,647
For the light bulb at least johntez

508
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
You may actually be near the end

509
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,864
