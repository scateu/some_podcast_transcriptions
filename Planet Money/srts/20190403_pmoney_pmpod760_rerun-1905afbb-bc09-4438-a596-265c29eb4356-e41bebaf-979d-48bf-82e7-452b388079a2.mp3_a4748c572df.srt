Hey Stacy here thank you for listening to plan it

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:06,400
Did you like the show and want to help us out have an easy way that you can do that

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:11,008
We want to better understand who is listening to the show and how you are using podcast

00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,848
So we're asking you to complete a short Anonymous survey if you got time

00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,896
Npr.org

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,920
Podcast survey

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
Less than 10 minutes

8
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,760
And it really helps support the show

9
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,832
That is npr.org podcasts

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,648
Now on Today Show

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,488
Today show with originally reported in 2007

12
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,072
But you know it is about taxes and what is more timeless

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,352
Ben taxes

14
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,144
Also we got an update for you at the

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,056
What are producers Kira Planet Money Elizabeth kulas had recently moved to the US from Australia

16
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,336
And she got this kind of

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,896
Interesting initiation into American Life

18
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
She did

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,432
Her taxes

20
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,272
At first she and her husband Matthew Harding tried to do it on their own

21
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,808
Then the taxes

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,344
And it took over their part

23
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,624
On our

24
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,672
Dining room table

25
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,464
We have a pile

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
WW2

28
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,888
Animism other forms like a 1095-c

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,704
Elizabeth and Matthew realized they were going to need some

30
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
So they hired an account

31
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,336
It could easily be $500 a weekend to spend at the account

32
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,712
What did Mayweather you say to me the other day you would be happy if was less than $1,000 what she said

33
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,272
This is all kind of blowing their my

34
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,320
It's because there was nothing like

35
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,344
This in Australia

36
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,672
In Australia paying taxes is really fast and easy

37
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:37,280
In fact Elizabeth the math you couldn't even tell me when Australian tax day what

38
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,584
So is there an equivalent of

39
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
April 15th

40
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
In Australia

41
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
Really

42
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
I don't remember being such a thing

43
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
I think it's like February or March

44
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
It's October 31st actually but in most of the rest of the world

45
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,480
They don't know when tax day is either

46
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,784
All of the crazy stress around tax

47
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
24-hour hotlines

48
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:05,184
Software the accordion folders full of receipts the lines down the street at H&R Block

49
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
That is

50
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
Pretty much just a USA thing

51
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,840
So we have it the worst our taxes are the

52
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
Worst

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
I filing system is it worse

54
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
Like adjectives

55
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
Yeah objectively

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,848
Joseph bankman is a professor of tax law at

57
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
And he says collectively

58
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
We spend billions

59
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,016
Of dollars and billions of hours every year filing our tax

60
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
Not to mention the emotional

61
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,880
Juices it does not have to be this way

62
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,184
In most of the world it's not

63
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
And Joe

64
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
Knows exactly how to fix this

65
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:47,168
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith and with me today is Alex may I see

66

Play Stacey Joe Versus the Texas.

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
That's right it's a story of this lovable professor

68
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,200
I believe the paint taxes does not need to be so difficult

69
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
Because I'm a year-long quest

70
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
McFarland taxes easier for everyone

71
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
Can you wake someone during

72
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
Who would want to keep taxes complicated

73
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
Well I will tell you who

74
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,720
A multibillion-dollar corporation

75
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,560
And one of the most important power Brokers in Washington

Typical

Warrior hero

88
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
What's the best way to describe

89
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:43,744
When Steven Spielberg inevitably directs a Blockbuster movie about taxes

90
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
Joe bankman will be

91
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
Who played by Tom Hanks

92
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,352

Down Tom Hanks

96
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,848
Alex when we talked to Joe bankman at Stanford you were marked nobody was very dressed up

97
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
Joe and I are both pretty casual Alex is being very sweet but as I look at these Sarah slat

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
I noticed

99
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,112
There's a stain on one of them

100
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
An

101
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184

Delete

103
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
I hate

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
Taxes

105
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
But you'll bankman

106
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Love's tax

107
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,191
Joe loves taxes so much that he thinks about them in his spare time

108
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
In fact

109
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,543
He spent time when he's not in class or on campus

110
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
Helping the state of California wear contacts

111
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151
Back in 2003 Joe is part of the

112
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,247
Little team that was working with the state to help take down Taxi

113
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:43,391
We are just done a bill to penalize a form of tax shelter

114
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,951
And it raised a lot of money for this day

115
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,327
And we're all out to lunch at a mediocre restaurant in Sacramento

116
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
Yeah we are celebrating

117
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
Joey his California tax

118
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,703
Neymar beating lunch

119
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,007
Can shop at the tell Joe they have the

120
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
And I did I think would save California

121
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,895
A bunch of money and time and help

122
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,711
Most people in California

123
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
Have really simatai

124
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,783
They get all of their income from a regular

125
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,343
And taxes are already withheld

126
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
When does Paychex

127
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,439
So their idea was why don't we start off

128
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,743
Giving them a tax return

129
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,327
That's already filled out with the income we know they have

130
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,631
And then they can make Corrections

131
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
That was their idea

132
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,775
Basically the government would send you a tax return that was already filled out

133
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,591
It would include all of the income that the state knew about all this

134
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
The taxes that had already been withheld from

135
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,455
And you would look it over and

136
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
Mail it in

137
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
Joni this was how taxes work in most country

138
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
That works in Europe parts

139
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,135
Asia Scandinavia Australia

140
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
And so he thought

141
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Why not here

142
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
The way I think of it is

143
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,535
Imagine if the credit card

144
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
Acted like the IRS

145
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,679
Each month you get a Visa bill and be a blank piece of paper

146
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,287
And you'd have to write down all of your purchases and added up

147
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
And if you did it wrong you face a penalty

148
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,919
So the IRS could

149
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
Act like Visa

150
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
And paying taxes

151
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Would be like

152
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
Paying a credit card

153
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,367
And we could be like Elizabeth and Matthew are first-time taxpayer

154
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,927
Not know when our tax day is

155
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,743
So now Joe and his team had this

156
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
But they still needed to

157
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,583
Make it real bad to figure out

158
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
What this

159
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
Form would be and what it would look like

160
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
And so Alex we haven't we haven't

161
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
In front of us

162
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,519
Do not look like a tax form

163
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
I've ever seen

164
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,895
Yeah you know it's it's just one page it looks pretty friendly it's not

165
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,943
A bunch of legalese you know it says

166
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
Easy as 1 2 3

167
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,343
Step 1 review return step to make any changes in step 3 send it back

168
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,927
That's it I know there's something so friendly about it at the time because

169
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,231
Filing your taxes just got easier

170
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,791
And then it has the name that Joe and his

171
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,863
Team gave to this form and enter this whole project

172
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
We called it a ready return

173
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
I like ready return it snappy

174
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
It's nappier isn't it

175
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,543
Now Joe and his California tax

176
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,079
Team have this form

177
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
Ready to spray friendly form

178
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,687
But I still need to see if ready return is actually going to work

179
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
If taxpayers

180
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
Use it if they would like it

181
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
So they did a pilot program in California

182
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:23,647
In the 2004 tax season isn't ready returns out to about 11,000 tax

183
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Along with this

184
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
Little survey

185
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
So we ask people

186
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
Do you think you'd like to use this again next

187
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,143
And 99% of the people said yes

188
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,471
99% of people don't say yes to anything

189
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,775
90% is amazing

190
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,615
I talked to someone else who's involved in ready return and what he told me is

191
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
When you work in government nothing

192
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
That's reviews like that he's a

193
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,271
You don't get 99% satisfaction rate with the polio vaccine

194
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,575
True

195
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,671
And it wasn't just the survey either think it was actually the proudest over

196
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
The comments

197
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
The people had written in on their surveys

198
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,559
And he actually brought a stack of

199
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
Printed out comments into Taco Bell

200
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
What I do

201
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,447
Is a rifle through some of the pages

202
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,775
And then I asked people to tell me when to stop

203
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:17,407
Because I don't want to anybody think I'm cherry-picking so tell me here are Alex can see me

204
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,271
Tell me when to stop flipping through the pages and I will tell him to stop right now

205
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,087
Okay cuz on a random page on some random

206
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,415
And the first one thank you for allowing me to participate

207
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,231
Second this was very easy and convenient

208
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
3rd

209
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,047
No problems I loved it

210
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
So I said I loved it

211
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:41,983
I love that skiers one that says PS is the same service available for federal tax

212
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
Returns this is all cap

213
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,383
Add someone used all caps positive

214
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
Yes

215
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,967
There was one comment that really stuck

216
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,319
Finally governments doing something to make my life better

217
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
What did you think when you read that

218
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:04,255
I was really touched them and I was really moved I'm even moved as I think about it now

219
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,583
For someone like me that's your your dream right

220
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,399
You know if you think about filing taxes he

221
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:17,311
It's one of the most important interactions you've got with your government and how does it make you feel

222
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
It makes you piss

223
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:24,223
You can understand that you're anxious you're worried about screwing up

224
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
And

225
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:30,623
We make 160 million people go through this each year that's

226
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
That's really bad

227
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
Did you think that

228
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,255
We improve that did you think it would like help improve

229
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
People's relationship with the government

230
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Absolutely

231
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Joe thought his little

232
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
Ready return form

233
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
Mickey big

234
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
Difference

235
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
In the country

236
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,871
Of course the first ready return had to pass the California state legislature in

237
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,967
But you wasn't that worried I mean everyone who tried ready return head

238
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,807
I've loved it and California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was also on board

239
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,671
So just started making the two hour car trip from Stanford to Sacramento every week

240
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
To talk with Legend

241
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
Well I thought

242
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
That if I just talked

243
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
Did Anders

244
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,143
I was kind of naive I thought well I get it

245
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
That

246
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,727
People are conservative or a liberal but

247
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,543
Since this is a nonpartisan issue

248
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,127
I'll just talk to all of our Representatives

249
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
In Sacramento and explain things to

250
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
I'm a talker I thought I could do that

251
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
Choza Taqueria

252
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:35,391
He is a talker and he he made a list of all the legislators would be voting on ready

253
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,231
Return any just started calling at their offices and asking for meeting

254
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,535
I wasn't getting enough meeting

255
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,887
Are people with put me off or they say we'll get back to you

256
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,935
When Joe did get a meeting

257
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
$10 go so well

258
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
Well one meeting

259
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,335
Somebody said I've been warned about you

260
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,431
That was sort of startup with what did they mean

261
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:02,527
They mad that the Intuit lobbyists it already been in

262
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
Intuit

263
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
Is the company that owns

264
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
TurboTax

265
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
TurboTax is of course

266
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,255
Be very popular tax preparation software it is a multi-billion Dollar business

267
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,375
A multibillion-dollar business that was now staring down the barrel of Jose ready return

268
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
And if you look at this from TurboTax is point of view

269
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,543
This is not good and ready which one is all about making taxes

270
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Easier

271
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,151
And if your taxes are easier you're a whole lot less likely

272
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,199
To spend a hundred bucks on tax prep

273
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Software

274
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,783
So just started hearing that into it

275
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
Was asking around about his

276
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Is plan

277
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
Which of these little talks you know for legislators about ready return he given academic talk for students and professors

278
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,047
And he started noticing something odd

279
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
Whenever he gave a talk

280
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,911
He would always notice someone from Intuit

281
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
In the crowd

282
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,543
They would show up at talks I would give how would you know that it was them

283
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
I give a lot of talks

284
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
And I'm only going to get it like

285
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
10:30 people

286
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:05,503
And everybody looks like an academic but one woman comes in

287
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,551
I just kind of looking a little corporate

288
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,599
She's like dressed better than the rest

289
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,999
And so that's a tip off right away tax academics or not the best dressed people in the world

290
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,351
Intermittent want to talk to us for this piece but they sent us a statement

291
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
It said that they have long advocated

292
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
Tax simplification

293
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,519
But they're ready return quote minimizes taxpayer engaged

294
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
They think that's bad thing

295
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,151
You discovered the into it had been very busy in sacrum

296
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
Meeting with politicians getting money

297
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,295
Intuit gave a million dollars to a Pac that supported one of the

298
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
The key politicians on the ready return issue

299
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
This kind of thing happens all the time

300
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
We have a little group it is

301
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
Very invested in an issue that

302
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
It affects a lot of people

303
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
Give me the little group in this case TurboTax

304
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
Is willing to spend

305
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,167
Tons of time and tons of money making something happen

306
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,775
And a large group of people that might benefit a little bit or not willing to spend that time and money

307
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:04,383
Prince I would love it if filing my taxes were easier but I haven't called my congressman

308
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,455
I'm not really willing to spend a whole bunch of money to make that happen

309
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
Then again

310
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
I

311
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
I'm Nacho

312
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
So that's

313
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:18,463
The point where I decided to hire my own lobbyist

314
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
Someone hiring their own Lobby

315
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,327
It was really fun I really enjoyed hiring a lot

316
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,631
I hired a guy named Mike Robson

317
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,447
Coart smart as a whip

318
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
Really likeable

319
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,127
Kind of looks like a more svelte James Gandolfini

320
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
But that lobbyists

321
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
He didn't come cheap

322
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
How much did that cost

323
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
They gave me a deal

324
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,599
Because they thought it would be kind of fun

325
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
The work for this

326
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
Craze Professor working for you

327
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Yeah

328
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,047
They're working for me and so

329
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,863
The normal price I think would have been a hundred

330
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
$40,000

331
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
Christy get Mike services

332
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,751
But he gave it to me for only

333
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
35

334
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
If I pay thirty five

335
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
Like of your own money

336
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
But my own money

337
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
Liquor savings

338
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,991
Yeah why did you spend the money that way

339
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,623
I know I felt lucky again to be able to do as a great cause

340
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,719
And everybody I think has some causes and think we're good causes and

341
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,583
This was a cause that was really good and nobody else was going to do it but me

342
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,911
Making that investment Iron Mike

343
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Paid off

344
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,007
With microbes and everybody would talk

345
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
Why

346
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,103
Well they had relationships with him

347
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
Legislators

348
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,199
Kind of like that I was with Mike

349
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
Because they also kind of legitimated

350
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,879
They figure if you're with Mike you're probably sensible

351
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,695
You probably are going to get good information

352
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,047
If I have a question I can call your lobbyist if I can't get ahold of you

353
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
The meeting start to go a little better

354
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
Legislator start listening to Joe

355
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Telling him

356
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
You got my vote

357
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
But Joe says

358
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
He noticed

359
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,543
It was hard to get Republicans to back Reddit

360
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,871
It wasn't just into it or campaign money

361
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
How to do

362
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
With a pledge

363
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
And privately I should say

364
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:22,111
A lot of Republicans told me what this just sounds like a no-brainer I just can't do it

365
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,951
Because Grover norquist is opposed it

366
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,023
Hello my name is Grover norquist

367
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:35,423
I am the President of Americans for tax reform we fight for taxpayers try to keep taxes low

368
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,007
Grover norquist is a famous anti-tax crusader

369
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
He heard about ready return

370
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
And sprang into action

371
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
So does a wave to raise taxes

372
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,247
A way to send people a bill for more taxes than they owe

373
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,575
And they're unlikely to contested people don't fight the IRS

374
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Norquist.

375
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,903
Ready return is tantamount to attack

376
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
Because once the government has tax

377
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,231
Autopilot

378
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
Signing and sending

379
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,583
Bill start sneaking things in like the house cell phone

380
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
Company sneakers

381
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,423
Little charges and you look at them and sort of wonder about them but

382
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
Me and you just pay because it's easier

383
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,775
And norquist has this famous Platt

384
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Republicans

385
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
All across the country.

386
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,127
Take it and the pledge basically says

387
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,431
I will not support any plan

388
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
That racist

389
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
And that was a problem

390
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
What happens if you break the pledge

391
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,599
When somebody breaks the pledge

392
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,671
Their opponents in the next election 10 to remind voters

393
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,463
They lied their way into office

394
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
I am depressed test

395
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,791
Focus on it

396
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,863
Northwest put out the word to California Republican

397
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
If you back ready return

398
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,447
You have broken the pledge

399
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,263
Joe bankman this tacswap

400
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,055
Professor and his loan lobbyist

401
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,383
Are now battling not only a multi-billion-dollar soccer

402
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Also one of the biggest

403
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
Names in US policy

404
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
Joe kept telling everyone this won't race

405
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,831
It will just make it easier to pay them

406
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
I'll see if everyone time and money

407
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,439
But Joe says he talked to a lot of small government

408
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
And actually

409
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
They wanted

410
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Paying taxes to

411
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Their logic was

412
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
If paying taxes

413
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
It's difficult

414
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
People will hate tax

415
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
And vote against them

416
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
Joe and Mike kept

417
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,543
And they started getting ground

418
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,639
Little by little with Democrats and Republicans locking downvotes

419
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
And a couple weeks out

420
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
They needed just

421
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
One more vote

422
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,575
One more vote to make ready return happen in the entire state

423
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
California

424
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
And then

425
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
I found a Republican

426
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,999
That was going to support it

427
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,815
Joe convinced a republican legislator to back the

428
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
Ignore the pledge

429
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
Ignore the campaign money

430
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:47,519
After a year of taking on corporate lobbyists political power Brokers and so many talk

431
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,079
After spending $35,000 a piece

432
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
His own money

433
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
This was it

434
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
Ready return

435
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
Look like it was going to happen

436
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
Just before the vote

437
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,527
Joe had to drive back down to stamp

438
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,599
Videos of the politicians who supported ready return

439
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
To keep them up

440
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,903
The day of the boat

441
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
Joe remembers getting a call

442
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,255
I could tell by the time this voice

443
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
What the answer

444
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
What's before I said any

445
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
He said

446
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:17,983
So and so I've even forgotten the legislators name is not with us looks like we're going to be one vote short

447
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
1

448
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
Vote

449
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Shorts

450
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,103
Republican and changed his mind

451
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
And Joe

452
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Had lost

453
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,759
And all of the other states that I've been calling Joe asking how they could implement the plan like this

454
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
The kind of dropped away

455
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,855
It was it was a little bit crushing

456
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
Hot to lose like that

457
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,975
How much time have you invested in this

458
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
You don't know why it was a year of my life

459
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,607
It's a pretty big blow

460
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
SoJO

461
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
Joann back to teaching full time

462
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
But he kept pushing ready return

463
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,799
A version of it did survive in California

464
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,615
It's buried in the state's tax site but it's there

465
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
A few hundred thousand people use it every year

466
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,247
And ready returns had a pretty interesting Legacy

467
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
In 2016 Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders introduced a bill that looked a lot like ready return the even

468
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
Reference Jose pilot program

469
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
It did not end up at

470
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,303
But Joe says we could getting close

471
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
Eventually

472
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
He thinks it's going to happen

473
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,399
My fantasy

474
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
Is that

475
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,287
At some point it just makes so much sense will join the rest of the world and all

476
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Paul dillet

477
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,151
And I don't know how that's going to happen with our current political climate

478
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,503
Maybe some mid-level bureaucrat I'll just make the change herself

479
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,831
And it'll go through it'll kind of fly under the radar

480
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,159
That's what I think will happen sooner or later

481
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Somehow

482
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,023
In the meantime people like Elizabeth and Matthew are first-time us

483
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,327
Taxpayers how to mention all the rest of us

484
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,143
Are stuck spending hundreds of dollars and

485
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
Many many hours

486
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Filing Arts

487
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,007
Play it is not without its ups

488
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:00,639
I never would have even said so like accomplishment when we get through it

489
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:07,039
I think I was saying Sally like if we can do this like we can do anything this is probably the most daunting task

490
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:13,439
It would come across by tax return

491
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:19,839

Stacy here it is now 2019 and I got an update about the tax story

503
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,591
Our very own tax Rodeo bankman is still teaching

504
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Stanford

505
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,431
He has not given up on trying to simplify our tax system

506
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,735
He has seen some changes he says but

507
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,783
Not exactly in the way he wanted

508
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,696
My thoughts are now less well-attended because into it doesn't send its Representatives anymore

509
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:22,560
Okay so Joe is not striking fear into the hearts of the tax lobby as much as he used to

510
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,144
He says he is still making progress little by little

511
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
Maybe one

512
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
Step forward and two steps back

513
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,848
The IRS is moving ahead with the plan to modernize data collection

514
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,872
And make

515
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,456
More of that data available in a timely manner

516
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
Do your tax preparer

517
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,576
So it would be easier for your accountant at least

518
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:48,928
Pepper regular people's would like to get their tax forms just all filled out automatically

519
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,304
Well that is not going to happen because of this one line that keeps getting added to the Appropriations

520
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,888
The industry is put a rider on a bill

521
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,704
That would make it illegal

522
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
4

523
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:07,104
The federal government to do the kind of return pre population

524
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,968
That is the basis for red returning the California still doing

525
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
Still

526
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
Joe remains Optimus

527
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,600
He says he's waiting to see if a new Congress or the next

528
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,416
Presidential election might Shake That writer off of the app
