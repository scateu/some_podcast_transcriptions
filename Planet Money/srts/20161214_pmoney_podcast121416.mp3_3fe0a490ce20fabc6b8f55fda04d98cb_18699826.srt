00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:05,376
Years ago Jonathan Goldstein had managed to save up enough money to do what he's always dreamed

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,912
Buy a smoker

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,496
You wanted it to be a company that actually made something

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:11,776
I'm physically

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,336
Anyone of there to be some Secret in house

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,616
I was made some magic

7
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,432
He found something that seemed perfect

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,528
A small factory located on a grassy Hill in rural Pennsylvania

9
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:27,648
You made these

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,672
Handbells

11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,816
Yep the kind you hear around the holiday season

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,888
Jonathan went to visit the factory to talk to the people there

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,424
The bells were beautiful

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,704
Musical perfection

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,544
But he says it turns out there was a handbell competitor

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,824
Just down the road

17
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,128
I said so tell me about this other company

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,432
I kind of looked around at each other and

19
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,248
Sarah said well you know

20
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,832
Historically we didn't get along too well

21
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,136
That it turns out was an understatement

22
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,208
The two Bell makers had basically been at War

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,280
The more Jonathan looked into it the weirder it all was

24
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,352
Handbells after all about playing nicely with others

25
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,936
Maybe you've seen a handbell choir in church around Christmas time or

26
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Kern Schools

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,984
Maybe you played in one

28
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,848
Basically you've got dozens or more people trying to play a single piece of music

29
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,152
For not to sound like a total mess

30
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,736
Everyone has to ring the right Bell at precisely the right time

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,144
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm David kestenbaum today we have a special holiday show for you about the Epic decade

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,496
Is long feud between the two companies that make just about every hand bell in the world

33
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,544
How they eventually made peace

34
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:57,504

41
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,760
When you got two companies down the road from each other making the same thing

42
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
You can almost guess the history

43
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
Originally there was just one company

44
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
Something happen

45
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
Maybe someone got angry

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
Somebody left

47
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
They started the second visit

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
A competitor

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,096
In this case that someone was a man named Jake Malta

50
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,936
In the 1960s he worked at what was the only Bill shoppingtown

51
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
Place called Schumer

52
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,032
And Jake was Schumer's chief engineer

53
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:57,664
Is library was full of books on music and nothing was not red

54
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Everything

55
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,760
And that you could see in his office had been read

56
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
Andre red

57
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,832
This is Jake's daughter Joanne Malta

58
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
Her dad she said was largely self educated

59
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,976
The kind of guy that when he got into something he got really into it

60
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,536
And he became obsessed with bells

61
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,096
He designed Schumer's first handbells

62
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,448
But then there was a change in management Jake Malta didn't get along with a new bosses

63
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
So we laugh

64
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,032
He could not stop thinking about Bell

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,360
If I had a way to make an even better handbell

66
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
A Love Supreme perfection

67
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
They haven't quite achieved Schumer

68
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
I got to explain a little bit about

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,600
About when you ring it it vibrates and produces this one Central note

70
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,904
But you also got these other notes in there

71
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
Overtones

72
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,280
Jake Malta wanted to try to get rid of as many overtones as he could

73
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,096
She wanted to make a bell with a very pure sound

74
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,912
That was the challenge of Holy Grail and Bell

75
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,728
So he set up shop in the family living room

76
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
Add folding table to Adam stretch out with all of his drafting supplies on there and then.

77
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,992
Piano behind them travel to Europe studied old books about the physics of bells

78
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
Did you lock the diagram

79
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
Cuz he knew that he could make it better

80
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
And

81
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,232
You know we still believe that he cheats at

82
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
Jake malta's new Bell have a slightly different shape

83
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
And this part is kiso remember

84
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:25,727
Can you remove the little brass knob at the top of the Bell where it attaches to the handle

85
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
Something called the Tang

86
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,871
The result he felt was a battle that produced an uncommonly pureclean song

87
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
Malta took his design and he started a new hand

88
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
Not far from his former employee

89
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,551
And he gave it a name like his own

90
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
Not Malta but mama

91
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
Tonight had to Bellco

92
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
The old

93
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
One show more

94
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
Selling Bells with

95
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
And Mama

96
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Jake's Lobster

97
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
Telling Bells with the tank cut off

98
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
And before we get to the decades-long war

99
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,191
I'm just going to play you what they were fighting on

100
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
This is a Schumer

101
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
The one with it

102
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,527
And this is a mall Mark Bell Jake's new bell

103
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
With the tank cut off

104
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,327
I have driven myself crazy trying to compare these two Bells

105
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,119
Sometimes I hear a difference

106
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,935
But frankly I think it might just be that I was holding a microphone

107
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Different spot

108
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:35,615
Can I play them again shoe Mark Bell with tang

109
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
Walmart Bella Notte

110
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,719
Some experts say they can tell the difference. They're divided over which one sounds better

111
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:56,607
The Bell Wars arguably began in 1976 here is one of the first shots fired in

112
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
It's an ad by Schumer

113
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:02,239
Trying to make the case that their original Bells with the Tang

114
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
We're better

115
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Read

116
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
All Schumer Bells have a tank

117
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
This is the Rays Crown at the top of the Bay

118
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
Now that gives the total brilliance

119
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
The mall Mart

120
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,271
Hereafter referred to as brand m

121
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
How's the tangless Bell

122
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,879
Sing it is a New Concept in handbell design tuning and performance

123
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,695
In reality they're weakening the tonal quality

124
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,023
I'm doing it even more when drilling a hole for the handle place

125
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,863
This ad infuriated mr. note on his bed

126
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
The at Walmart

127
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
In fact the reason the text of this as still exist

128
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,519
It's because it was recorded in legal documents

129
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,823
Jake sued his former employer

130
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,663
Court cases are chance for both sides to have their say

131
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,455
And I have someone impartial way the f

132
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
So you can just move on

133
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,551
And in this case the two Bell makers did settle

134
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
And they came up with a solution

135
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
That seems like it would put all this behind them

136
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,231
Both sides agreed not to compare their bills to the other spells

137
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
Which seems like a fine idea

138
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
Unless of course you are in the sales department

139
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
It's your job after

140
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
To go out and talk up

141
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
Your bell

142
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,215
Kermit junkert wasn't Schaumburg sale.

143
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,031
He said these were kind of terrifying time

144
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Because remember

145
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,871
Neither side was supposed to compare its belt

146
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
The others

147
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
Which means he couldn't say for instance

148
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,991
Are handle is solid vs. Hollow

149
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,551
The lawyers came up with a workaround

150
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,391
Special kind of awkward phrases the salespeople were cleared to use

151
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,463
Free sample our handle is not Hollow

152
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
Well by saying it's not

153
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,423
Something you would refer or infer that someone else's handle is Hollow

154
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,519
Indirectly of course I mean literally there were legal team

155
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,615
That would write here's what you can say oh here's what you can't say

156
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,175
And that was that would come about from

157
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,247
Whoever won the latest lawsuit

158
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
How long did that go on

159
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Forever

160
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,927
They're even apparently spies

161
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,791
Kermit says sales people would be giving their pitch and they see someone in the audience watching them like a hawk

162
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
Scribbling down notes about

163
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
What they said

164
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
And then

165
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
A letter wood

166
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
From the other side lawyer

167
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
Here we actually have one this is from Walmart

168
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
The new bellmaker

169
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
Complaining about a Schaumburg sales pitch

170
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:19,967
It has been brought to our attention that you have been making false and disparaging statements about Mall mark handbells

171
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,295
Letter goes on to list those disparaging statements apparel

172
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
Hey by the show Mork salesperson

173
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,647
Quotes their handles break frequently

174
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
You must jump up and down on ours to break them

175
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
There's another one

176
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,559
There's a problem with polishing Mark Bells

177
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
You must only polish up and down

178
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
ARS can be polished in any direction

179
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
I asked Joanne Malta about this

180
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,287
Did they really have spies in the audience taking notes

181
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,103
I had no idea

182
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:53,503
I certainly let you know what the different conventions and all I would imagine

183
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
Are wraps attending

184
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
If they heard something

185
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:04,255
That was a negative about Mall Mark that it would come back and I'm sure that's happened in

186
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
Reverse 2

187
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,375
It's funny to think about all this fighting happening in front of the customers

188
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
Two of coursework

189
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
Musicians in church choir directors

190
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Middle School

191
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
That's what the customers

192
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,847
And the sales people weren't trying to just sell single Bell

193
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,663
They're trying to convince an entire choir

194
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
To exclusively ringing their Bells only

195
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Go all time

196
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
No go No Tag

197
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:32,415
In one mile marker Shamrock succeeded in selling a whole set to a big-name bell choir

198
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
They brag about

199
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,023
The music you're hearing right now this is the arsis handbell ensemble

200
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
All malmark Bells

201
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
Not a single Schumer

202
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,639
For years the Tang question hung over the battlefield

203
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,223
Did Jake malta's Innovation really make for a better bail

204
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
Where did the bell sound better with it

205
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
Here's another shumer CAD for my court

206
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,159
This one seems designed to drive Jake Moulton totally mad

207
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,487
Quote the Tang is the Rays Crown at the top of each

208
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
And not all handbells have it

209
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
But Schumer candles do

210
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,167
The Tank's weight and mass help reduce Fuller tone greater

211
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
Note those last words there

212
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
Greater amplitude

213
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Basically louder

214
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,359
Here was a scientific claim that could actually be test

215
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,967
So now this conflict would consume management lawyers and salespeople

216
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
Spread to the engineering department

217
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
Sound Engineers that show Murray

218
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,135
How to try to back up this claim that the advertising the farm

219
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
Probably dreamed

220
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,255
And remember these are sound Engineers who got into the business because

221
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
They love music

222
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,095
I want to be creating the most beautiful instruments

223
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,423
And now they've been dragged into an ugly lawsuit

224
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
I had to build all this testing app

225
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,823
Including a robotic ringer that hits the bell with exactly the same Force

226
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
Gregory Schwartz was one of the engineers who worked on

227
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Though

228
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,735
Even remembering the whole episode make some kind of weary

229
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
He says

230
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,551
The Tang did make a bell louder

231
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
But

232
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
Not much

233
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
Early looking at

234
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,999
Percent or two maybe something like that is a couple percent louder

235
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
Maybe

236
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
Is the average Joe going to know the difference

237
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
I

238
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
Don't think so

239
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,263
It wasn't like it sounded but it was just slightly louder

240
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Right

241
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
That's basically

242
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
But that was a premise

243
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,991
NFL's with tangs produce more sound

244
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,343
Another side said bologna that's not true

245
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
How he said yes it is true

246
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,719
Like all wars this one consumed an enormous amount of research

247
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
In researching the story I could not keep track of all the lawsuits

248
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
We're just two men

249
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,399
McGregor told me about this one that is worth mentioning

250
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,959
It was over a patent on The Clapper machina

251
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,263
I think it actually hit the bell and makes it ring

252
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
The case got appealed and appealed

253
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,151
Until it was at the doorstep of the highest court in the land

254
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
US Supreme Court

255
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:08,063
The judges I just kind of threw the whole thing out and sitting on that we're not going to waste our time with that but

256
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
They

257
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,439
It went back and forth for years it was just horrendous

258
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
The US Supreme Court

259
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
They tried it

260
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
I tried it

261
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,607
I think normally when you read about lawsuits between companies

262
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,167
You think they're the result of some business calculus

263
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
Some strategic decision

264
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
And maybe that was true at the beginning

265
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
But pretty soon emotions

266
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,895
Once you get in a fight like this once you spend a lot of money on lawyers

267
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
It's hard to give up

268
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
The long Wars can be the hardest to end

269
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
Especially things good person

270
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,855
I can see being she'll meric the original hand outcome

271
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
Thinking who does Jake Malta think he is

272
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Cutting off the

273
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
That's so silly

274
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
Is setting up his own Belk

275
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,095
And it's easy to imagine how maddening things must have seemed on the Walmart

276
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,447
Joe and Martha told me it's totally understandable her dad Jake

277
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,519
Would try to take the Bell fight literally to the Supreme Court

278
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
He felt really wounded in wrong

279
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
Things got ugly

280
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,663
You stole this from me know you stole it from me

281
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
Spencer tabaxi to think about it

282
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,855
Does because my dad was a very honest man absolutely but he was he was going to get a seminary

283
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,999
It was not the kind of person to steal anything so

284
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
Was the Han

285
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Bell

286
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,631
Ringing world out there aware

287
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
Of all this

288
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Oh yeah

289
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,519
This is perhaps the most amazing

290
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
Part about the story

291
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
I kind of imagined that

292
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
The bellringer

293
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
All those choir directors in teachers

294
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
Will be kind of laughing at all

295
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
Even be oblivious

296
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
But it was the opposite

297
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
Some of them got totally swept up

298
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
They took sides

299
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
Way more strongly than you might imagine

300
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,231
People at both mama can show Mark remember various in

301
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
Here's one story from the mall marks

302
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
Told by Tim Schubach

303
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:59,423
Who had gone to an industry meeting I had unbeknownst to me mistakenly

304
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,983
Set hello to Schumer customer

305
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
From our booth

306
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,567
The customer continue to walk by

307
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,895
An over-the-shoulder not even stopping to acknowledge me

308
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
Set Worsham rack ringer

309
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
And a very kind of

310
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,367
Condescending way in the end after many many years of the courts throwing up their hands

311
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
Monarch had a kind of victory

312
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,463
Jake Malta was awarded $2000000

313
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
That was a lot less after the legal fees

314
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,863
His daughter says he put a lot of the money into a handbell education fun

315
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,703
There Wars that end because one side surrenders

316
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
Another Wars where no one gives it

317
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
There isn't even a truce

318
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
Do sides just stop fight

319
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
A day passes than a year

320
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
In another year

321
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,247
Jake Malta the proud perfectionist engineer head of Mark

322
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Wesley pastor

323
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
And so did the people calling the shots at Schumer

324
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
The younger Generations

325
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,695
Tim you just heard came to run Walmart

326
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,791
Am I summer he got word that someone knew had bought schommer

327
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
Someone who seems like a very odd fit

328
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Fidel world

329
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
When I first heard I'm like what

330
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
What's going on here

331
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
What's the crazy story ever heard

332
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,567
Shomer Kevin bought by Jonathan Goldstein

333
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
The guy you hurt at the top

334
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
Former lawyer

335
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,663
Who knew nothing about him

336
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
I do less than nothing

337
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
I can't even read music

338
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
Author Jonathan is Jewish

339
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,319
There are a lot of handbells in synagogues

340
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,903
Very famously for my employees right after I bought the company

341
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,695
I brought one of my rabbis up here

342
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,743
Thinking you know maybe I've missed something

343
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,327
And I showed him the bells and I said how about it and he looked around the room

344
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
It is very long beard

345
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,911
And he said it took a minute or two and said

346
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
Nope nope never not going to happen no

347
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,751
Statue system

348
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
It was quite a moment

349
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
Shortly after Jonathan bought the company

350
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
He and Tim

351
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
The new heads of both companies

352
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,479
Found themselves at the same meeting in Cincinnati

353
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,111
He came up and is very Jonathan way and and was he's not bashful at all you know he's

354
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,207
Very gregarious and came up and I just bought Schumer

355
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,535
Hey what's up man how are you how are you how's it how's it going

356
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
So I said you know

357
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Hi

358
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,679
Wow

359
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,799
My understanding is that these two companies went out of hammer and tongs for a lot of years and

360
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,127
I'm just not ready to do that it said it seems to me that

361
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,527
You know you're not my enemy and I'm not your enemy the enemy is the 300 million people out there who don't ring handbells

362
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,135
Let's go get those people

363
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Getting ready

364
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,743
And this meeting between that had the two companies did not go unnoticed

365
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
If there were a weekly handbell Gazette

366
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
This would be front-page news

367
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
Historic peace Accord

368
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,959
We were observed just sort of sitting off in a corner talking

369
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
And the the whole place was a titter at the fact that we were even talking to each other it was simply not.

370
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,407
For like 20 years

371
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,711
Jonathan and Tim seem to actually like each

372
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,295
And in that meeting they talked about working together where they can

373
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,111
It was it was so welcomed it was just like

374
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
This great weight

375
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
Coming off of our

376
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Chess

377
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,511
This is Kermit again who did Salesforce turmeric

378
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
As is often the case after a long War

379
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
The soldiers were eager for peace

380
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,935
Yeah we can about it as being the Hatfields and McCoys but

381
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,983
Hit it literally felt that way

382
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,335
You know it's like whoever had the bigger guns and take no hostages and

383
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,663
And just obliterate the other side Oliver handbells

384
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,967
Haulover handles amazing isn't it

385
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Who is Bob

386
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,831
That I not live through it I would have thought of it

387
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
If you were to write a book about this

388
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,695
I think most people who say no that didn't happen

389
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
It did happen

390
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
And it was over

391
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,583
When I talked to Kermit he just got in a Christmas card from Walmart

392
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
The first he wrote to me in an email

393
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Cool

394
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
And maybe this is occurred to you

395
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,263
It's occurred to me and it's occurred to Jonas

396
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,847
Does the world really need to handle companies

397
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,431
You got two businesses that basically make identical products

398
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,247
Maybe now that the bitterness is gone

399
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,295
There should be a wedding a merger

400
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,111
Maybe malmark and Shamrock should become

401
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
M&S belt

402
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
I'm not sure that's going to ever

403
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,255
Cuz having two companies

404
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,791
Kind of benefit everyone

405
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,351
People at Walmart and Schumer told me

406
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
Okay the Bell wars were bad

407
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,959
But I kind of like knowing they had a competitor down this

408
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,775
And if you're someone who Rings Bells

409
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,335
It is so much more fun to be able to pick size

410
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
Which bell sounds better

411
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
One with the Tang

412
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
Or the one without

413
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:42,047
This is the Sonos handbell Ensemble one of the few choirs that mixes chilmark and Mal Mark Bells

414
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:49,215
We would love to hear

415
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:53,311
Hear what you think of Today Show you can send this email Planet Money at npr.org

416
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,383
I'm sure today was produced by Jess Jiang thanks Jess

417
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
I did a casting down thanks for listening
