00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Just a little note today's podcast include some bad words actually the same bad words said over again in Rapid City

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,472
Hi Jacob

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,240
Here's a photo

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,080
This is a surveillance photo we're pretty sure taken by the FBI

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,128
You want describe it yeah so it's

6
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,408
Two men and a parking

7
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,712
It looks like the picture was taken from across the

8
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,248
You see the men in profile

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,064
The man on the right is wearing sunglasses at a

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,344
Dark jacket

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,648
Handing an envelope to the man on the way

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,744
What I love about this photo is it captures the exact moment where the guy on the left

13
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,096
Actually taking me over the closing right over

14
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,656
We can tell you what's in that envelope because this whole thing ended up

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,704
It is stuffed with money

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
The envelopes filled with $100

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,312
This is a picture of

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,592
Insider trading

19
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,384
You care about insider trading in the news

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
Who is this abstracting

21
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,224
No here is a photo of it happening

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,296
Insider trading where one person tips a friend off about some

23
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
Merger

24
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
Or leak some

25
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
Information

26
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
They buy some stock

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,928
Can you make a ton of money

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,976
This one made for a particularly good

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Insider trading feels like cheetah

30
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Because

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Because it is

32
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,544
And it strikes this nerve

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,080
For people who feel like

34
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
Markets are rigged

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384
You know here is your proof

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,224
Right to men in the Starbucks parking lot exchanging an envelope

37
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:31,392
What welcome to Planet Money I'm David kestenbaum and I'm Jacob Goldstein today on the show we talked

38
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,792
That man in the photo taking the envelope full of trash in the Starbucks parking lot and he tells us everything

39
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
What he did

40
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,656
How we did it and why you did but I don't know why he's still kind of training

41
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:48,544
Author what is insider trading the law is not actually there isn't really a law

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,944
And we dig into this brain teaser the money that Insider traders made where exactly does that come from

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,808
Who are they stealing from Today Show is a rerun from 2050

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
If you call them out they will just not

51
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
Call you back

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
Where they say talk to my lawyer and then the lawyer will

53
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
This case is different

54
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
So

55
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760

00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,808
I am the guy in the photo yeah

57
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
This is Scotland

58
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,904
I've been a while I was

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
CPA

60
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,744
A CPA a certified public

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
Accountant

62
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,584
That was an accountant working at one of the biggest accounting firms in the world

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
KPMG

64
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
And he was good at his job

65
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:50,752
You got promoted over the years to where he was overseeing 500 people spread across the whole region

66
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,312
And he says it was a kind of job you could feel good about

67
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
They were conducting audits

68
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
Hundreds of

69
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
Publicly traded

70
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
Making sure those companies weren't cooked

71
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
Books are making

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,784
Got all the big decisions ran through him

73
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
And in the course of

74
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
Doing that

75
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
What do you learn about a company

76
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
Everything

77
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Hefei

78
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
After really everything

79
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:16,864
What's going on internationally what's going on with quiddity wise what's going on with future projections

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,728
I thought you would know as much as almost anybody inside the company about

81
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
The company

82
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Yes

83
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
This was of course very valuable information

84
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,408
And Scott says it was super clear that it was supposed to

85
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,248
The whole point of the audits was to ensure fairness

86
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
In the market

87
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
They would check in

88
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Improve the company

89
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
Financial statements

90
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,392
And then that information will be released to the world

91
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
Everyone would get it at

92
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Level plane

93
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,304
That's if they had Essex training classes every year or so

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,912
Reminding people about the importance of keeping the information secret of keeping it confidential

95
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
As a boss

96
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Scott says

97
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,616
She was often the one telling people to be careful not to even let anything be overheard accidentally and there were numerous occurrences

98
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
I swear

99
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:05,760
You know you're on the 30th floor of an office building you all head down as a group to lunch go get a bite to eat

100
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
And you're in the elevator and and you get you get on 437 gets off for 20

101
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
I had to

102
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Discount

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
Put my finger up to my lips

104
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:21,887
Or do you like that the stop sign over your neck is that you don't hey stop stop talking that type of thing

105
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,959
Sometimes his friends would ask him you got any stock tips

106
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
And his answer was always

107
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,519
No I can't tell you anything

108
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,079
Sorry but it is hard not to talk about work

109
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
And Scott had this one

110
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
Name Brian Shaw

111
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
They belong to the same color

112
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,759
We went out for dinner and we play golf and we

113
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
Occasionally travel together

114
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,951
It went to concerts together it was one of those nice relationships that exist outside

115
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
Out of the family part of your life they weren't hanging out

116
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
Because their kids like

117
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Whether they like

118
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
And Brian was in the wholesale jewelry

119
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
But sometimes seeing Scott talked about stocks

120
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
Erie Safeway

121
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
Until one day when Bryan when Scotsman

122
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
Makes this proposed

123
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
Eagles hey

124
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
I no way that we can both make a little bit of money

125
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
You give me information

126
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
I'm going to trade on it

127
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,295
I will split it three ways

128
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,879
I keep the third you keep a third and the government gets 1/3

129
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
What did you think when he said

130
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,071
My initial reaction was I was joking

131
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,119
I just yeah I said want you we can't do that

132
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,983
Definitely does not need the money he's making more than $500,000 a year

133
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
But he says

134
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,591
His friend Brian's jewelry business is doing really bad

135
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,871
Play this is right after the finance

136
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,223
And his friend says he need some help so Scott considered

137
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
I can just a little bit

138
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575
What was going through your head at the time

139
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
You know it

140
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
A battle

141
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,999
The simple version of one side is that I knew it was wrong it was stupid

142
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
Alan the other side

143
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
Is

144
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
Alright well

145
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
He's a good friend

146
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
I trust him

147
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
You know

148
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,263
If you're your training and you know you're your

149
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,615
You're only going to make 10 or $15,000 who's going to know

150
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Okay

151
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
I'll do it

152
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,991
And he stepped across that line that for years he's been telling people not

153
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
And here is how the insider trading

154
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,879
Scott agreed to pass Brian infirm

155
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,487
They did this about companies you may have heard of including Skechers the shoe company

156
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
Herbalife

157
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
That makes weight loss

158
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:31,423
For example just before Herbalife was about to release its earnings report to the pub

159
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
Public sayings

160
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,495
Whatever saying hey we had a really good quarter

161
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
Scott and Brian would talk on the phone

162
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,895
Scott would tell Brian what those results were going to be in advance

163
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
Before the public knew

164
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,967
Brian would buy the stock or

165
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
Place a bet that the stock was going to go up

166
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Then the official announcement

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
About and the rest of the world

168
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
Play a little tape from CNBC

169
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Brace yourself

170
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
Herbalife reported seeing Beauty Court

171
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
Stories coming in about 43 first-year Rose 28.5% you

172
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Amazon

173
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,751
Do like this comes out the stock price goes up you can make thousands of dollars in a moment

174
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,103
In a minute just from having that little piece of information before everybody else

175
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
But here is something super weird

176
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,991
Where exactly did that money come from

177
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Intimate

178
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:35,679

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
More it service now.

186
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Who got robbed here

187
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,839
It's kind of a brain teaser think about Jacob you and I spent a long time trying to work this out with diagrams on

188
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:10,239
Drawing circles on paper and lines like okay here's the insider trading here's the money and wait who is the victim

189
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,055
Who's on the other end it's kind of tricky to think about because

190
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
Like if Brian buys stock

191
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Right

192
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
He bought that stock

193
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,735
So you could say the person who sold that stock to him

194
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
That the person who got robbed

195
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
Because the stock went up

196
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,671
Yeah but that person wanted to sell that stock at that price if Brian hadn't bought it someone else would have

197
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
The seller that is not the Vic

198
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,559
We are not the only people who have struggled to figure this out there are a bunch of

199
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Of academic

200
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
And here I think is vegan

201
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
Somebody was deaf

202
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
It's just really hard to know who

203
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Think of it this way

204
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,847
For purposes of explanation imagine that Brian had bought

205
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
10 shares of herb

206
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Okay

207
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
That is 10 shares that

208
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
Someone else

209
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
Doesn't own because Brian.

210
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,343
We don't know who would have owned it Brian didn't exist but somebody would

211
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
That somebody that unknowable somebody

212
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
Would have profited when the stock went

213
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
That unknowable somebody

214
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
That is the victor

215
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
That is the person who got

216
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,423
You're looking for someone who doesn't own the stock lots of people out there who don't

217
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,263
I think it's Brian have gone to Scott and said hey let's Rob someone's house

218
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
There's no way Scottwood

219
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
But this felt different

220
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
Scott says that was part of his thinking at the time

221
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
It felt like a victimless crime

222
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,783
God says he gave Brian inside information about about a dozen

223
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
And he says Brian paid him

224
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
For that information

225
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,367
In all these different way

226
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,671
What to give a watch Rolex

227
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
Another time but expensive

228
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,767
Tickets to a Bruce Springsteen concert sometimes

229
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
You just gave him

230
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,887
Usually they do the exchange indoors somewhere once the O'Brien called and asked

231
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Meat in a Starbucks

232
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:49,055
He was going to be traveling he was going to be going someplace he actually wanted me to get this money in my hand

233
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
Is there anyway you can meet me

234
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
Like okay well I'm

235
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
At work

236
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919
You know just a

237
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
Couple miles away

238
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,807
You know I can meet you there if you really want to it says yeah let's do that they meet at the parking lot

239
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
Nearby

240
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
There is a cow

241
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,927
Pants that photo that would later be all over the Press

242
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Amscot taking me envelope

243
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Stop Twitter

244
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
$5,000 in cash

245
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
In hundreds or what

246
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
100

247
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
$5,100 bill

248
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
What what do you do with

249
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
$5,100 bills

250
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,311
To be specific I put it in my underwear drawer ins in my closet

251
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
I always wonder where you should hide

252
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,199
Not long after that Scott remember the date because

253
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
What's his wife's birthday

254
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,783
He was home alone in the morning getting ready for work

255
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
And there's this knock on

256
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Will the doors

257
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,439
Summit beveled glass all I could see was kind of just 2 images

258
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
The first reaction that I had

259
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,583
Was it was too guy to Jehovah's Witnesses

260
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
He opens the door and

261
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
Two men showing their FBI badge

262
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,959
And ask can we come in

263
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
And I said of course and they came in

264
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,567
It was probably a 30 step walk from

265
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
The front door

266
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
To the kitchen table where we sat

267
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
Nobody else was home

268
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
They showing that photo in the parking

269
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
Federal agent and his friend Brian

270
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Right then

271
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
Escada sitting there

272
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
He sees all the Dominos

273
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
Was like okay was my wife going to say

274
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
What are my friends going to say

275
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,071
Oh s*** was KPMG going to say

276
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
Oh s*** I'm going to lose my job

277
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,703
Oh s*** I'm going to owe a lot of money oh s*** I'm going to go to prison

278
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
It got worse

279
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,055
Scott got a lawyer and one day they were on their way to court

280
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
In the lawyers car Scott's reading the news on his phone

281
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,663
And he sees this story about his case

282
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
It has something he says he didn't know

283
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,783
His friend Brian hadn't been just making small trades for

284
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
For a few thousand dollars

285
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
The story says

286
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
Brian has been placing much bigger

287
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
Says he made 1.27 million

288
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
And I almost threw up right there in the car

289
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,351
And I actually told my attorney he got pullover

290
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
He was driving but I just you know I was just

291
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,751
Fearful that I was just going to lose it right there

292
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
So I just I just couldn't believe it

293
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
And once I saw that I said

294
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Holy

295
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
Holy hell this is

296
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,223
Yeah this is obviously going to be a lot worse

297
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
Got off to learn something

298
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,319
After his friend Brian had gotten caught

299
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
Brian helped the FBI

300
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
Set up a sting

301
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
Some of those last phone calls have been

302
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Unrecorded

303
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,255
And that meeting in the Starbucks parking lot with the envelope

304
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
That was a setup

305
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
Is all spelled out in

306
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Import document

307
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
Other course they were the TV Camera

308
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,167
Weather reporter standing up in front of the country

309
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,823
All started here seemingly innocent

310
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
Golfing friends and Buddies

311
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
The whole thing goes before

312
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
Are we get to another

313
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
I think frankly that I found surprising

314
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,807
When I started learning about this whole thing and that is the way the law

315
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Insider trading

316
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
We talked to Sarah baumgaertel

317
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,695
She's worked as a defense attorney with fellow at Yale Law School

318
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,279
Something interesting about insider trading law in the United States

319
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
Is that there's actually

320
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
Nola again

321
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
Insider trading

322
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
So there is no law that says like

323
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,239
The insider trading law passed by Congress or

324
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
Or whatever

325
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,823
Correct there is no lie like that and in

326
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,639
In typical Congressional session they have

327
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,223
Increase the penalties for whatever insider trading is

328
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
With

329
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,343
And she said well everybody gets upset it inside her

330
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
Because you give someone an unfair

331
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,951
That is not the legal reason

332
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Why it gets

333
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,047
The argument use these days in court for wife

334
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,887
Is that insider-trading amounts to stealing information

335
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
It's like that

336
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:34,079
And so for that reason proving that someone traded on Insider information that is not enough to convict

337
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:40,479
It's a financial document from some company blows out the window and you happen to find it sitting there on the sidewalk

338
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Terraces

339
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,343
It's not insider trading for you to use that to make money in the stock

340
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Because you didn't steal

341
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
One of the Box you got a check

342
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
The person providing the information

343
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,511
That person has to benefit

344
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,071
And in fact a bunch of

345
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,655
High-profile insider-trading cases were recently dropped

346
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:05,055
Because an appeals court ruled that that among other things the person providing the tip for adding the information

347
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,127
That person has to benefit in some substantial way

348
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
Who ran through Scott London's case with Sarah

349
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
To see if it met all the criteria

350
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,063
One did he give away information that he had a legal duty to

351
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
Yes absolutely

352
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,647
Did someone trade them in infamy

353
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
100% yes

354
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
Did Scott London benefit

355
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
We told Sarah about that photo of

356
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
Muscat getting cash

357
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
In a parking lot

358
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
That sounds bad

359
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
He agrees with

360
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
So so

361
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
Is he guilty of insider trading

362
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
Is this a trick it sounds like

363
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,383
Siri obviously guilty of insider trading

364
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,455
He pled guilty immediately immediately to identify

365
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
Scott confessed right away when the FBI came to

366
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
To his house

367
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,183
Ever since I got in talking to Scott is that he's one of those people

368
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,743
If you ask him a question he is just going to

369
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
You're Scott on the courthouse

370
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,655
TV reporter asked him a question about how much money he made from the insider trading

371
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
And he doesn't you know.

372
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
The question doesn't run

373
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
He gives this very complete

374
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
Accountant like answer just

375
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
Listing of each thing he got

376
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:23,135
Items that were

377
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:42,335
And the jewelry

378
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:47,199
The people back in the studio on TV after this they were talking about it like

379
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,807
Who missed their half a million-dollar a year job for $70,000

380
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,135
Scott says his friends asked him at 2 and he does not

381
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Have a great answers

382
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
Can't say exactly why

383
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,255
I asked was it exciting

384
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
Thrill part of it

385
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
No wasn't exciting at all

386
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
Was he trying to get his friend to like him or what

387
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Is that what it was

388
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,447
No ever

389
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Master my mind

390
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,287
Got that he was kind of overworked and unhappy with

391
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
The job so

392
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
Everything felt a little lesson

393
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
Maybe that had something to do with it

394
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,223
He says crossing over that line was somehow just not as hard

395
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
As it should have been

396
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
Scott says what he did was just

397
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Donkey says

398
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,391
But he's as well as best as he can figure out as best as he can

399
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Reconstruct

400
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
He did it to help out his friend

401
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,767
And he says he didn't think they were going to get caught

402
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,815
Scott was sentenced to 14 months

403
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
Is given a window to turn himself in

404
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,959
Because of a mix-up he ended up spending a month in solitary confinement

405
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,519
But most of the time he was in a minimum-security

406
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:49,151
Spend a lot of time walking around the track they had listening to a small transistor radio telling other inmates

407
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
No I

408
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,223
Can't help you figure out that accounting issue with your marijuana

409
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
That was really a couple months early for good behavior

410
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
I think about what I did everyday

411
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
I think I let you know that

412
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,487
That. There's Downer days but for the most part no 80% of time I have

413
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
I have good days but I think about

414
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
How life would have been different

415
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,399
Were you able to go back to your your turn of your personal life

416
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Yeah

417
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,775
Yes I committed a felony

418
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
There no doubt

419
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
I did something bad

420
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
But

421
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,431
You know I'm 53 years old and I've

422
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
And that

423
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,783
What I did there does not in my opinion does not define my

424
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
Personality of an

425
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
Who I am in a core

426
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
My friends understand that

427
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
They were

428
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,951
They'll say the right to my face

429
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
You're an idiot

430
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
I can't believe you did that

431
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
But I still love you

432
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,351
And I still would you know stand right behind you if I ever needed

433
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,167
Do you still belong to that Country Club

434
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,959
They kick me out

435
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,007
You ever see Brian Shaw

436
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
I have not seen him

437
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
Or spoken to him

438
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,943
Since the day he gave me that package in the Starbucks parking

439
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
Scott says they do live in the same

440
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
And they go to the same restaurant

441
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
So he knows he's going to run into a

442
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,903
And of course we asked him what do you think's going to happen when you do see

443
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,463
He said I'm not going to hit him so I can go to punch him

444
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
I just want to tell it

445
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
When the FBI caught you

446
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
You should have just come to me

447
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,655
I would have turned myself in we could have skipped all the drama

448
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,495
They never would have been that embarrassing photo in the Starbucks parking lot

449
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,687
One last thing I did call Brian Shaw when I was working on this story

450
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:33,087
He answered the phone I told him who I was and he said he was not interested in talking

451
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,695
You can send this email we are Planet Money on NPR. Org you could beat up at Planet Money

452
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:44,095
Arshad name is produced by Jess Chang special thanks to Bill Wong at the Hastings College of Law he was the one who

453
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:50,495
Finally definitively answered the question of who is harmed in insider trading
