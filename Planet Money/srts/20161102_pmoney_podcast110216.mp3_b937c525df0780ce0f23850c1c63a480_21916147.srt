00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,216
Presidential candidate

4
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,800
He was a fake candidate but his policy ideas were great

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,336
At least according to economist

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Today

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,408
You will hear us bring our candidate

00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176

Tomaki but not necessarily pro-business

15
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,632
Thrown together with one impossible mission

16
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,216
The come up with an economic plan to rescue the economy

1 cat

18
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,032
In order to save the country

19
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,568
They're going to have to work together

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,432
To restructure the tax code

21
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:55,808
The the corporate income tax makes no sense whatsoever eliminate cherish deductions

22
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,136
Did mortgage interest deduction to preserve the environment

With the scourge of illegal drugs make them legal

26
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,912
And maybe just maybe

27
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,008
This ragtag team can come up with a platform that every Economist would love

28
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,824
And every presidential candidate would hate

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
Except

30
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,128
For our fake one

31
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:26,528
God bless you and God bless the United States of America

This

34
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,072

35
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,936
Create a fake presidential candidate based on the best ideas to economics has to offer

36
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:48,288
Wheaton Planet Money episodes where we created the platform for presidential candidates

37
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
We hacked up disagreements we brought in political Consultants

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:56,224
Laughed at us at first but then said no no we can help you sell this plan

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,016
We have done it all and today

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
We take it to the

41
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,880
The people very carefully selected and Screen group

42
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
The people

43
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:09,024
You take this to a focus group in DC and ask would anyone vote for these crazy ideas anyway

In order to see what real people think

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
You have to go to a very

56
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Take place

57
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,104
We're in Washington DC in this.

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Generic off

59
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Tower

60
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:01,504
Probably one of the blandest conference rooms you've ever seen and that's actually a picture because

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,808
This is where they do the focus groups

62
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:10,208
And nothing is supposed to be controversial here it's supposed to be very Bland nothing to distract real voters from the real

63
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
Pinyin

64
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
Sure information in this room

65
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
I got to say it was pretty sweet

66
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,656
We had to sit behind this two-way mirror looking into the conference room

67
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,424
And we watch

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
Does a LED 10 independent voters in

69
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,080
It was cool because we could see them we could hear everything they were saying

70
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
But they can see us

71
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Thanks everybody for

72
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
For coming out

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,504
I will try and do something that you never get to do in real life

74
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
Listen to a bunch of people

75
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,880
Talking about you take a planet money talk about our kindness ideas

76
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
And they have no idea that we're listening

77
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
I feel like

78
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
I feel like I'm eavesdropping on my phone

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Another thing that's weird is that

80
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
People in the folks

81
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,608
Describe there in the sterile room it's really bright

82
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
But we're here behind the glass

83
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
It's dimly-lit

84
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
There's some rows of seats

85
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,288
BA free drinks and all you can eat M&Ms

86
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
It's kind of like being in a movie

87
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,176
Ipsos public affairs in Washington DC kindly agreed to let us borrow their folks group

88
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,480
For the night Michael Gross is the moderator

89
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,040
And he told us what to look for he says

90
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
You're basically looking for something called

91
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
Resonance

92
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
Which is not only what people say

93
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
But what they don't say

94
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Part of the beauty of focus groups

95
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
And having people

96
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,559
Be able to see them

97
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,887
Is you can see the small little Visual and physical

98
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,935
Ques like what you'll see people

99
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,287
You know kind of caulking the head maybe starts and start to nod a little bit like

100
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:33,151
Okay I get the concept and yes I I liked it so I should be taking notes on that ice

101
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
Just be watching for that

102
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,063
Yeah you should be watching for visual cues often times you'll see people you know if they're not really interested in something

103
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Built the push back from the table

104
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,975
Cordell cross their arms in front of them which means they really don't care about talking about that

105
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
Kind of subject

106
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
We move our chairs up about 2 in

107
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Glass

108
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
So we can catch every

109
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,519
Angela Clark and runs the political team at if so sits next to us and Michael moderator goes into the room with the focus

110
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
And he hands out our play

111
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,639
So everything we worked on in last six months is now a stack

112
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Papers

113
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
And each page has

114
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
1 iD

115
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,271
One item of the presidential platform on it

116
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,831
Any purchased a focus group to start going through it

117
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
With a pen

118
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
He asked them to cross out what they don't like

119
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
And circle what they do

120
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
There was a lot

121
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255
There's a lot of Crossing out

122
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,839
The first idea is one that are condoms from across the political Spectrum love

123
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,399
It's to get rid of the mortgage interest tax

124
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
If you want to home

125
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
You can write off of

126
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
A big chunk of your mortgage on your taxes

127
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,615
I kind of sake what this really is is a huge government subsidy for

128
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
People who happen to own rather than rent

129
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
Michael read off some of the argument

130
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
For eliminating

131
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
Mortgage interest deduction is an

132
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,855
Extremely regressive form of Taxation and music

133
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
Extremely perverse

134
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,719
That we shouldn't be helping Bill Gates or whoever

135
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,535
Subsidizing them to get an expensive home

136
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,631
Rich people get a larger subsidy which causes the price of houses to

137
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
The increase

138
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,703
Making homes less affordable for poor

139
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,775
And what they don't know is Bowser actual quotes from

140
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,103
Previous shows at Planet money has done it but he's just read them up

141
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
And

142
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
People when they hear this

143
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
They shake their head

144
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
Lakebay

145
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
Hate everything he sang

146
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,087
Unless a table is A well-dressed older woman her name is Irene

147
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,719
We have a briefing book that tells us about all the participants here and this tells us that she has a high school education

148
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
And although it doesn't say it we can tell

149
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
Woman owns her own home

150
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,423
Three-quarters of your mortgage goes to interest so if they eliminated that

151
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:36,799
On that deduction it would be like you're throwing your money out the window every month

152
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,871
You know if you didn't get that deduction get something for it

153
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:45,247
Once people start talking about this you can pretty much tell who owns a home and who doesn't because

154
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
The homeowners

155
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
Hate this idea for a very simple read

156
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,391
The amount they pay in taxes is going to go up

157
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
But that is inevitable

158
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
And then the moderator

159
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,047
Explain another argument about eliminating the mortgage interest tax deduction

160
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
What's this

161
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,119
This deduction is subsidy by the government

162
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Actually

163
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,703
Makes the price of homes too high if you eliminate it

164
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,519
In the price of homes will actually go down

165
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
And you can see people just look

166
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
Karafun paid at this process

167
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,479
Yeah Maryland end we know from our book that she makes under $25,000

168
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Xavier

169
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
She has some college at 2

170
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
Location

171
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
Fastest way to group when she speak

172
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
They really listened to

173
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
She hates it

174
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
If

175
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
Housing prices go down lower

176
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,303
This is going to be very dangerous especially for a

177
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,375
Decided it's top-heavy with baby boomers are the Raging

178
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
They were actually like economist

179
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:42,335
The came up with this I just want to let you read you a couple of comments that actually made a sour face when the moderator said the

180
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,735
Visceral reaction like

181
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
About they were like listen

182
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,087
No one's going to care that Economist design this plan

183
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,367
Hilo pretty Lake

184
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Economist

185
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Turns out

186
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
They were right

187
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,535
Yeah and it gets worse because it turns out it's not just the economist they hate

188
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,631
They hate the very language that the economist use to help sell the

189
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,191
Even the words are turning off the voters

190
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
It was one young woman

191
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
Eva a

192
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,103
And she dropped it to say that she hated one particular word that she her

193
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Eliminate

194
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
Fake ID time you laminate something or get rid of it

195
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
It's going to backfire in a different area

196
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,295
There's lots of nodding now around the

197
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,135
Julia from episodes she leans over to us as soon as she hears that

198
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
This kind of thing from a focus group participants this is exactly what the political Pros are listening for

199
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
A picture of this

200
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
They might not want to use the word eliminate

201
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:44,031
Those words scare her and they wouldn't want to use those words in a communication because it would be off-putting perhaps to

202
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
Server has two people from her demographic

203
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,175
Strongly moderate taxes

204
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:54,783
Why candidate sound the way they do often times cuz their statements have been Focus Group

205
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,623
It does mean a modulate their own opinion so

206
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
Conley

207
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,303
I don't mind them up with American voters that some of probably there aren't reviews are lost I think that's almost certainly the

208
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
McKay's

209
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,983
You know it's the Challenger focus groups that are useful but to what extent you want to react to them and to what extent

210
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,543
Define the face of public opinion I mean

211
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,591
It's a balance for politicians to deal

212
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,663
Better to know now than later

213
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:27,551
Even if you're going to stick to your guns and say something I'm popular at least you know how people are going to react and that's useful to

214
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,391
It's not just the words that people hate that the pros are listening for

215
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,207
They're also listening for the way people describe things

216
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
The language that they use

217
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,583
Because what better way to appeal to the average voter

218
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,143
Then to use something that came out of their own mouth

219
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,703
Julia says that when you see those ads

220
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,847
Set featured this real person or that real person some of those people actually came into focus groups just like this

221
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,711
Yeah that's what we're kind of hoping for but at least when it comes to the mortgage interest tax deduction

222
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
There were no nice

223
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
We're not going to have

224
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,855
Okay so quick show of hands

225
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,927
How many of you would vote for a candidate that had this is

226
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
Part of the retina

227
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Dollar policy

228
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
Without specifics

229
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,559
With no specific

230
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Absolutely not

231
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Okay

232
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,679
Nobody raised their hands

233
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,983
Tintoretto monel

234
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
I'm scared

235
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
Flight number one

236
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
They hate it

237
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,175
Yep no one supports eliminating the mortgage interest tax

238
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Not single

239
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
And this is just the start of it

240
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,087
It was a long night people either hated the plans or they

241
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
They didn't understand them

242
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Sometimes

243
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,487
Does the moderators going through our list of ideas

244
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,023
Boat after boat turns

245
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,119
Becomes had this idea about taxing health benefits that's rejected

246
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
Almost immediately

247
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Another idea

248
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,799
Which was to move away from an income tax to more of a consumption-based tax collector

249
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
The bat they have in Europe

250
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
Baptist Mission

251
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
Weird and vague

252
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
2 actual words used by Focus

253
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Participants

254
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
Another plank in our platform was eliminating the

255
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Corporate income tax

256
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
The Economist argued

257
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
Attacks or something we want to encourage

258
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,231
Corporations making profit we want them to reinvest the money

259
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
So that they can go out and hire p

260
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,631
Yeah when people argue that we should have a high corporate income tax what they're really saying is

261
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,703
We want to soak the rich want the rich to pay their fair share

262
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,543
And it comes aren't you just don't do that through Corporation if you want it

263
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,615
Rich people then text rich people

264
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,199
Leave the corporations to create jobs and if they pay out of their profits

265
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
Their shareholders and dividends

266
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Then you can talk

267
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
But this idea

268
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
It gets Steve

269
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,879
To lean forward he's sitting at the end of the table

270
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
College-educated

271
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
Middle-aged

272
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
Just isn't buying it

273
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
So if you don't

274
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
Text the the companies

275
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Houston

276
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
Where are you going to get the money from

277
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
Just Like Heaven

278
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
Is so strange

279
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Behind the glass

280
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Because

281
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,359
You want to go in and argue with the guy

282
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:04,223
Because I kind of thought of this they've described where the money can come from and you can get it

283
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:09,343
In-N-Out places it's just basically Shifting the tax burden and what they would say if they more

284
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
Fair and effective and productive

285
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,463
It doesn't it doesn't matter because I'm not allowed to argue with the guy

286
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
And Julia for ipsos

287
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,815
She says this reaction happens all the time

288
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
And you got a client behind the screen

289
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
And the message testing is going badly

290
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:29,311
All that you can do to keep that client for marching out of this room into the focus group room

291
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,103
And explaining to

292
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,431
Joe from Cincinnati why his position is wrong

293
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:40,831
If you have to convince work that hard to convince someone of your point of view you've already lost the argument when it comes to

294
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
Vacations in messaging

295
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,695
But I've definitely been in this room before with a client who is

296
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,047
Has to be restrained literally from going around the around the corner to have a chat

297
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
What does that people on the phone

298
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
Are moderated 6-1

299
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
Particular idea for

300
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,471
And you can see why

301
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
He wanted to keep

302
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,567
So every Economist agreed absolutely

303
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
We should legalize marijuana

304
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
They said making it illegal to

305
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,431
Dry ice price

306
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
Drug dealers rich

307
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,063
The government gets no tax revenue for it and yet the government is on the hook

308
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
To build prisons

309
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,647
Put all those people who smoke pot into the prison

310
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
So they agree that this just

311
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
Economically makes no sense

312
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,559
But the folks at ipsos Julia and Michael

313
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,655
They predicted that talking about something like drugs was bound to divide any good

314
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
And you were right

315
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
People, think about this issue and

316
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Consider both sides

317
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
They're just either immediately for it

318
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Or against

319
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,687
You can really go to jail for a small amount

320
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Weird

321
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
It's

322
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,063
It's not

323
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Okay

324
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
Marijuana helps a lot of people

325
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,743
It can be social it can be for recreational use

326
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
And

327
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
I guess

328
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Creative

329
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,655
It makes you creative in some ways if you're

330
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
Artistic

331
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,263
I have enough faith in my own creativity

332
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
That I don't need

333
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
To make myself fart

334
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
Official in my brain

335
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
To be creative

336
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
It in me

337
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
And I don't need a

338
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
Drug

339
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,855
To turn the key and I don't think anyone else does either

340
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
Unless you become dependent on it

341
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,487
But that's going off.

342
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,815
That was Mark in Maryland they are never going to

343
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:32,191
Agree on this issue at a fact that's true the entire focus group when they took the vote

344
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
The group is evenly

345
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
Split on legalizing pot

346
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,591
In some ways this was a tiny Victory because

347
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,407
Legalizing drugs did better than just about

348
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
Any other plank on our platform

349
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
But you cannot build

350
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,039
An entire campaign was approved by economist

351
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
On legalizing

352
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
It's just not going to

353
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,159
But little did they know we had our

354
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,975
Secret weapon we've been talking for weeks to

355
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
Political Consultants

356
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,071
Advertising experts to the best in the business

357
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
Are wechat listen

358
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
You know these ideas are going to be a tough sell

359
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
What do you got for us

360
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Help us convince people

361
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
That they would vote for this candidate

362
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Soap

363
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
We told the moderator

364
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
Bring up the ads

365
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,895
Okay picture guy in a casual shirt

366
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
He's talking straight to the camera

367
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
He's standing in front of some

368
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
Out-of-focus foliage

369
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
Annie's going to talk about

370
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
The Economist plan

371
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,903
Now our moderator just read up a copy to the focus group

372
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
We're going to do it with an act

373
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Courage

374
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,279
Common sense

375
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,863
I know that the fix our economy we need some hard truths

376
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,471
Legalizing marijuana would save billions in law enforcement and prosecution

377
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
Add to the tax base

378
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
And stop making drug dealers rich

379
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,383
Mifold jobs plan would end the corporate income tax

380
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,223
So American companies can reinvest and create American jobs

381
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
It's about hard truth

382
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
It's about change

383
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
It's about time

384
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,463
Vis-a-vis by political consultant Joe Slade White

385
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,767
He's got a buffalo and he's won a ton of awards

386
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
He's been doing this

387
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
4 years

388
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,095
Right away

389
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
With the focus group

390
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
We can see that

391
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
Wasn't quite work

392
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,239
By including all the controversial parts of the plan

393
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,055
People just have this immediate visceral reaction

394
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Part of the plan

395
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
They didn't like

396
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,151
Or maybe more than one part of the planet

397
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
The addres started that whole argument

398
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
We had about marijuana

399
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
I don't think it matters what he says

400
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
Because

401
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,879
The legalization of marijuana

402
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
Is one of those

403
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Dairy

404
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
Pacific

405
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,511
Polarizing issues

406
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
Like abortion

407
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
Like gay marriage

408
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
And

409
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
You're for it or you're a Genet

410
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,239
And there's nothing to candidates going to say that's going to change your mind

411
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,335
Okay stay away from drugs in a political campaign

412
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
It took a long time to learn that

413
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
But we learned

414
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
But we had another ad

415
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,991
This one came from the strategy

416
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
Commedia

417
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
Alex tornero is there

418
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
Creative director

419
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,367
I need a different approach

420
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
Rather than putting in a bunch of ideas

421
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
He focused on just one

422
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,999
Eliminating the mortgage in

423
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,839
It's time for real tax reform to help the middle

424
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Class

425
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
4 years our country is subsidized home mortgage

426
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,751
A deduction that benefits the wealthy and pushes up home prices

427
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
For everyone else

428
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
It's unfair

429
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
And I believe it's time we end that.

430
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,687
And return the savings to you by bolstering education

431
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
Improving Services for Seniors

432
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
Funding job training for

433
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,343
Okay I'm just going to pop in here for a quick second because

434
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,671
I just I should mention here that the ad guys came up

435
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
The bit about

436
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
Children

437
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
And seniors

438
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Not yet

439
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
Okay proceed

440
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
Renting owning

441
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
Large house with small

442
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,727
American families deserve a fair tax plan that helps every home

443
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
I'm an actor

444
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
Giving voice to a plan designed by economist

445
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
And I approve this message

446
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,407
What's after the moderator weeds

447
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
Out this

448
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Market

449
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
The end of the table leans in a little bit

450
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Incest

451
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
Thumbs up

452
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:06,463
Seriously they like you to remember every single person voted against this when we use the economist link

453
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Now

454
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
Even Maryland

455
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,095
The one who is so concerned about house prices for baby boomers

456
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
Even Maryland

457
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Kind of liked it

458
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
I think that

459
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
It's an effective ad

460
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,263
So we're feeling pretty good we're thinking

461
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,823
We are actually going to pull this off

462
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,431
The help of these experts we're going to convince people that these are ideas they would actually vote for

463
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
Things that they like

464
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Yeah no

465
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
Yeah

466
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
It turned out

467
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Defect with

468
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951
After the focus group wrapped up if you were heading out I told Marilyn aside and said tell me more about how you really like

469
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Like that at

470
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,559
And she said that although she liked the part about Fair taxes

471
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
JCP ad

472
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
Left you with a big Quest

473
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
Wait a minute

474
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,215
What are they eliminating

475
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,007
How does that help with

476
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,567
But in that quick moment

477
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
It feels good

478
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,223
And I guess this is why political advertising gets a bad rap as manipulative

479
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
But

480
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
I was thinking like

481
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
There is

482
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,623
A serious Point here which is if you can make someone

483
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Feel good

484
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
About an issue

485
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,207
Even for a quick moment

486
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,327
Then maybe they can consider an idea that otherwise they would have completely

487
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Shut out the

488
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
So

489
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,679
The whole thing the emotional content the kids

490
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,471
Seniors distressing

491
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
Fair tax

492
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,519
Airtech butt

493
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
In some ways

494
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
All we did

495
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
What's the open

496
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,407
I need or open a door that says

497
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,967
The mortgage interest tax deduction week in Italy

498
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
Just talked about

499
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
We can at least

500
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
Consider what the economist

501
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Had to sack

502
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
One small problem

503
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
Economist

504
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,927
The folks who came up with these ideas

505
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
They hate

506
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:48,607
They spent a long time explaining the intricate logical reasoning behind their plant

507
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,911
Anime C 29 seconds of

508
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,751
Let's be honest like not the most sophisticated thinking in the world

509
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,591
So you like all of Luigi zingales from the University of Chicago

510
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
And

511
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
He looked at the ad he said you know

512
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
You picked

513
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
The wrong

514
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
He said that we should have pointed out

515
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,063
Dubai eliminating the mortgage interest tax deduction

516
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,855
We could lower tax rates for every

517
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,415
India you're pushing more

518
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:17,279
We can spend the money and a lot of other ways and location this and that which is also true but

519
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,327
Is not the way I was salad

520
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,631
Dean Baker another one of our comments

521
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
Hue Lights

522
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
The part about fairness

523
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,727
Ethos uses that argument himself

524
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,543
Cops we should have pointed out

525
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
Did the mortgage interest deduction

526
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
Doesn't save as much money as most

527
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
People think

528
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
In other words

529
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,271
We could have argued instead that getting rid of that deduction won't hurt

530
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
Too much

531
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,367
Everybody has ideas after you make your ad right

532
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:47,487
Captain Baker from Harvard she agreed with the Luigi and Dean Baker about some of those criticisms

533
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,047
But you came away with sort of a bigger lesson

534
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
Perhaps she said

535
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
She and the other economist

536
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
Perhaps they should stick

537
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
The classroom

538
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
Where they have ours

539
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
Hours

540
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
An hours

541
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
To explain this

542
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:06,431
From an economic perspective where we try to spend a lot of time going into the details of the pros and the cons of things

543
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,759
That just doesn't seem compatible with the 30 second sound byte

544
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
I'm going to let you decide what you

545
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
I got to stay there like

546
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
Did a pretty good job

547
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:19,744
Encapsulating that sort of warm fuzzy feeling you get from a political ad where you just look at the

548
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,280
The candidate say hey

549
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:25,376
I talked to that guy only wearing a tie

550
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
Check yourself

551
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
Npr.org

552
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,496
A little bit impressed with how

553
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,080
Politically ahead his if you can if you want TV

554
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,432
You wouldn't think twice you wouldn't think that's a radical Economist plan you would just think

555
