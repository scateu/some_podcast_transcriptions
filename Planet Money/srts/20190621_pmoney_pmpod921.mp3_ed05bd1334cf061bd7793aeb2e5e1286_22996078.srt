1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,072
Sarah Johnston's brother was huh

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,864
That's how all this

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,632
Started

4
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:09,728
Last fall she was driving her brother home after minor leg surgery

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,032
. they pass this strip mall

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,056
And her brother spots

7
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:13,824
The Jamba Juice

8
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,896
Can we pull in there and get some Jamba Juice

9
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,432
That sounds so good

10
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,456
Parking lots

11
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,504
We park right in front of Jamba Juice

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,784
They get their Jamba

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,320
And then her brothers

14
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,600
Cease a Jimmy John

15
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
And he's like

16
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,672
Can we also get sandwiches

17
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,792
The Jamba Juice and the Jimmy John's are in the same parking lot but they're owned by different

18
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,560
People

19
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:38,656
Jimmy John's is in a separate building in the corner of the lot

20
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,936
Cordoned off

21
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240
This is barrier like a chain

22
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,776
Separating

23
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,592
Vista parking lot wearing from the Jimmy John

24
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,128
I have a picture of this chain

25
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,152
It's thick

26
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
And Metal

27
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,528
Looks like a giant industrial version of those velvet ropes you see it red carpets

28
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,600
Except this one is covered in yellow rubber not velvet

29
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:01,952
And write down the chain there these shoots signs every 6 feet or so that say

30
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
No parking

31
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,256
Jimmy John's

32
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,072
Park on the street or in our parking lot

33
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
So the side of the parking lot

34
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
Did Sarah is in

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,936
Is not for Jimmy John's cut

36
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
But like

37
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
Who Among Us would actually move our cars in the

38
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
List of recently

39
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,824
The Jamba Juice is just

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,128
Right next door they're already parked

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,432
So Sarah and her brother just

42
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,760
Step over the chain and get their Jimmy John's sandwich

43
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,344
Their hobbling back to the car her brothers on crutches

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,416
Recetas bright yellow boots

45
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
Stuck on

46
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
My truck tire

47
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,304
The thing they immobilize your car tires

48
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
And

49
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,400
Immediately just look around the parking lot like wow like

50
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,288
They were only in the Jimmy John's for 17 minutes

51
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
She showed me the receipt

52
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
My brother

53
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,664
Still on narcotics

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
He starts

55
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,760
Yelling and a to put this on here where are you come talk to me

56
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
And there's a guy

57
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,368
Starting to get into a

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
Black sedan

59
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
The guy walks over to them and says

60
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
If you want that boot off you have to give me

61
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
$75

62
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,096
Because this is Jamba Juice parking only

63
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
And they pull other Jamba Juice Shake

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
We were one of those

65
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
We haven't even drink them yet they're still slushy

66
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
And he says

67
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,336
You were Jamba Juice customers

68
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
Till you cross

69
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,920
Into the island of Jimmy John

70
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
The moment

71
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,992
Jimmy John's furnaces

72
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
You're no longer a cuss

73
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
What

74
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,464
So at this point the Jamba Juice employees come out and tell the guy they are our customers

75
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
Please take the boot off

76
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,840
Their vehicle she says no the boot stays on

77
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:49,472
Jamba Juice appears to have no power here they apparently did not hire this guy

78
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
And now serious like weight

79
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
What is happening here

80
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,384
If Jamba Juice doesn't want this guy booting people why is he there

81
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,688
But Sarah's brother is

82
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Is fresh from sir

83
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,272
Still has ice pack strapped his leg

84
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
She's afraid

85
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
To push this anyway

86
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,904
So she pays and drives away Furious

87
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,768
And then she did what anybody should do if they stumble upon a mystery

00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792

The time that I am too embarrassed to tell you but

138
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,327
I have become a little obsessed with this strip mall in Salt Lake

139
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
It's called the 4th South Market

140
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,519
And the first thing I wanted to do of course was talk directly to the guy in the mysterious black

141
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,151
I'm actually from Salt Lake I was born there so I dispatched someone I know there too

176
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,079
Karen this is Lauren about she oversees the parking division in Salt Lake

177
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,407
And she is very familiar with this strip mall

178
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,967
Yep I know the one I have the same experience

179
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,367
Really we're just the guy in every individual unmarked car that got me I asked her to city do this kind of Buddha

180
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,695
She was almost offended by the question

181
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
I mean we can't just take your property

182
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,839
Free from you and it's a city tickets you or boots you you can contest it

00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,119
But it's not

184
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,191
Clear who you appeal to in the Jamba Juice Park

185
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
Which leaves me with

186
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,543
One final question

187
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
Is this legal

188
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
Okay to question

189
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
If it is

190
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
What

191
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,967
I called the Salt Lake City Police Department

192
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,527
They too are very familiar with this parking lot

193
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
Yeah it is

194
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
It happens very often

195
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,647
This is detective Greg wilken

196
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,183
And he says

197
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,767
Yes what is happening in that parking lot is legal

198
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,327
Because that parking lot is on private property

199
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,863
What we're dealing with is

200
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
Private property

201
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
And the businesses they

202
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
They have the right

203
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
2

204
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
Or boot your vehicle

205
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
Especially if it's supposed to

206
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,759
He says unless a crime is committed there is nothing the police can do

207
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
There's very few things that can be in

208
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,879
On private property

209
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,207
Like if you're in a mall parking lot and you run a stop sign

210
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Greg

211
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
He can't pull you over

212
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
Thermo cups can but Greg

213
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Octonauts

214
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
So

215
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,935
If you are Sarah standing in that Jamba Juice parking lot your only recourse

216
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,495
Is to sue the parking company

217
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,543
For $75

218
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,127
Which is just high enough a price that you are angry

219
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
And just low enough

220
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,735
That a single customer probably won't Sue

221
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:59,647
But there is one company that has a lot of customers that are being booted and that is of course Jimmy John's

222
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,743
So it seems like they have the most incentive of anyone to solve this

223
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
I called them up

224
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
You just keep getting bombarded with

225
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,399
Customer complaint this is Robert Madsen

226
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,215
The CFO of a development company that owns this Jimmy Choo

227
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
John's

228
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,055
He says he gets a handful of calls about this every week

229
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
Is a big problem for the

230
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,663
And I can't analyze all of their 1-star reviews

231
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:27,551
Of the people that left a message about why they're giving a one-star review 68% were related to a boot

232
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Wow

233
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
Robert told me that

234
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
4 years there was peace

235
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,463
In the fourth south parking lot you could park anywhere you want it

236
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
But then one day

237
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,327
The owner of the strip mall set up those chains

238
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
And he hired that sneaky Boudoir guy

239
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,239
And Robert told me that this has become such a problem they have hired someone

240
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
Not to make sandwiches

241
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
But to stand outside

242
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
By that chain all day long

243
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
Just to say

244
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,967
No no no trust me you do not want to cross that line

245
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
He says

246
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,855
They've stopped 820 people from parking in the wrong parking lot in just the past six

247
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,023
They spend nearly $30,000 on security and this parking monitor more than 10% of what that story even earns

248
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Deniers

249
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,375
And Robert estimates that Parking Solutions the company that is

250
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
Is doing all of this building

251
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,983
If they get nearly $200,000 in Boots

252
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
A year on Justice parking lot alone

253
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
They would not confirm this

254
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
With me but Robert says

255
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
The Parking Solutions guy told him

256
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,991
That they split 50/50 with the strip mall landlord

257
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,063
It's like the owners of this parking lot have found this

258
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,111
Petty loophole in parking lot

259
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,695
Are there any parking lot owner anywhere could take advantage of

260
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
It means

261
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,767
Feel like public property

262
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,815
You're in a parking lot not inside of it

263
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
Steven looks like public property theirs

264
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,935
Painted lines even stop sign sometimes

265
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,263
So it feels like a place where the normal rules apply

266
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
But

267
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,127
The moment you step into a private parking lot

268
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
You have stepped

269
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
Into the Wild West

270
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
Where the rules

271
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,527
Are whatever they say they are

272
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,927
Hello Nick fountain

273
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,255
Well I was calling every bureaucrat in Salt Lake City

274
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,071
You are off chasing a different parking lot story

275
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
All you told me is that

276
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
You would call me when you got to a parking lot

277
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
So tell me where are you calling

278
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
Okay if you leave

279
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,823
Washington National Airport

280
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
And you take

281
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,431
The free hotel shuttle to the closest Holiday Inn

282
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
And you walk just 50 feet down

283
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
History

284
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
You will get to a parking lot

285
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,159
That's where I am right now I can hear the cars

286
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
Vlad is over

287
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
And I'm here because

288
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,791
I heard that in this parking lot Uber drivers

289
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,071
R gaming this

290
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,191
Okay alright I'm parking lot based mystery I'm in Uber drivers

291
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,007
Really didn't want to be recorded talking about this

292
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,151
Nobody nobody want to speak English

293
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
Okay I don't need a record

294
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
I'll turn it off

295
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,295
But I spent the afternoon talking to drivers about

296
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
What it's like

297
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:14,719
To work for Uber around here and they told me basically the same story that you hear from every overdriver mainly

298
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,535
It's really hard there barely making any money

299
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,887
Especially when you consider the wear-and-tear they're putting on cars but they told me

300
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,959
The one place there's sometimes making money

301
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:29,055
Is the surge I hate The Surge the surge is when there's like

302
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,615
A limited supply of the drivers there's lots

303
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Septum and

304
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:39,039
Rainstorm happens and you like you're dying and you want to get out of the rain and you look at Uber and all the sudden

305
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
3 times more

306
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,391
Uber jacks up the price to encourage more drivers

307
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
To come out yes I do hate the surge

308
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,743
And here in this little parking lot

309
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
It's not just

310
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
Strictly supply and demand

311
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,143
Some guy that I talked to told me

312
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
Sometimes

313
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
They are manipulating the system

314
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
What

315
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Here's how

316
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
Babies apps to tell them

317
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,407
When a big search is about to come when a bunch of planes are going to land

318
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
And they'll sit in their cars and they won't log into the app

319
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
Until one of their Buddy says

320
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,111
The Surge is getting higher the surges getting hired don't get on don't get on

321
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,927
Okay now everybody go on the surge is really high

322
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
Let's all go make some

323
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,511
What's so they're basically like

324
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
Manufacturing scarcity

325
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
Text creator

326
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
Search

327
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
Like it's not an act of God like

328
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
It started raining it's like a

329
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,495
Bunch of Uber drivers in a parking lot

330
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,543
Decided not to sign into their app

331
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
And I asked them like

332
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
Does this make you feel bad cuz you're

333
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,735
Going over people like me who use the app and then like

334
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,551
I don't know man take the subway wait a little bit

335
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
Or

336
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,903
Realize that we're not getting paid a lot right and

337
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:52,255
I should say that I learned about this from a local ABC News 4

338
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,351
And a lot of these guys were super pissed about that news report

339
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Because

340
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
A few things happened after that

341
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
1

342
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,263
Some of them got fired by Uber or kicked off the app

343
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,823
Now there's a police officer who like

344
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
Patrols the parking lot and gives people tickets

345
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
If they're not

346
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
On their app

347
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,527
AKA they're trying to get the surge go up some guy actually showed me his ticket

348
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
And

349
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,135
Uber has capped The Surge at $10

350
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,999
A ride so they're really mad about that you can get it

351
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Ticket from the cops

352
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
If you're not on your app

353
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,191
It's weird but it's a parking lot owned by the airport

354
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
These are airport code

355
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
This is a private

356
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Parking lot n

357
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,615
We have learned in a private parking lot you get to make whatever Wild West

358
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Exactly

359
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
End

360
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
This is a super

361
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,831
Interesting parking lot do you have some existential thoughts while inhaling

362
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,391
Car fumes in the parking lot

363
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
I did

364
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Here's what I think

365
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
We are in this economy that

366
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:03,167
More and more is becoming itemized right we're in the gig economy and all these men and women who have these jobs

367
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,007
Barely get to meet each other and get to talk about their work

368
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Conditions

369
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
But

370
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,359
One place where all these Uber drivers

371
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
Meetup would be

372
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
The airport parking lot

373
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,247
It's like the water cooler of the Uber

374
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:23,647
Driving proud it's the water cooler of the gig economy it's the factory floor of arm

375
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,695
Modern Age and of course the first active

376
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
Collective action

377
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,535
Of the gig economy that I've really heard about

378
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
Would come out of here

379
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
That makes sense actually

380
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:38,751
Yeah I should get off the phone cuz there's a bunch of guys praying right next to me I'll see you back up in New York

381
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
Okay alright safe travels

382
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
After the break

383
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:49,759
We meet the lawyer who is trying to overturn hundreds of millions of dollars in parking ticket

Yep got an Amtrak did some audio editing and here I am

402
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
30 seconds later

403
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,967
You're just in time for our last story which

404
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,039
She's also about parking but this one has to do with the country

405
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,087
The story starts in

406
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
27

407
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
Two hour parking spot

408
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
Outside the courthouse

409
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
Saginaw

410
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Michigan

411
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,279
A lawyer named Mac Rhonda was sitting in

412
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,839
Ford F-150 taking some calls

413
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
Well I'm on the road quite a bit so I mean I think

414
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,679
I myself like most lawyers have

415
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
Quite a few conversations in their vehicle

416
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
He was on the phone with Phil Ellison another lawyer

417
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
They work together a lot on class

418
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:24,991
Actions they like to sue the government on behalf of a bunch of people with hope that they will get monetary damages

419
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,527
And while he was talking to Phil

420
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
She noticed

421
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
Is rear view mirror

422
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Someone walking up

423
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
I saw the meter maid

424
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,231
In all kind of a protein at the side street marking everyone's Tire

425
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
With their Tire wand

426
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,655
You know these things like when you park in a 2-hour parking spot parking enforcement officers will

427
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,215
Go around the parking lot and Mark everyone's

428
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
Tires with chalk

429
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
And I'm going to come back 2 hours later if

430
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
If the check is

431
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,591
Still in the same place

432
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
You got a ticket

433
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
Looking at this happening behind him

434
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
Parking enforcement officer

435
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
Closer Chuck

436
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
Nexcar Chuck

437
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
Next car

438
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,903
Chuck the thought had occurred to me when she was about three or four cars behind me

439
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
Imma just pop into my head

440
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
Sitting there in his truck mat thanks weight

441
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,815
Did I just witness a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution

442
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,911
Institution which protects us against unreasonable searches and seizures

443
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,215
I literally blurted out is this a search

444
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
It's such a lawyer question

445
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:25,151
There was a lawyer question you know we we analyze the world a little bit differently than the average person

446
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
Play Matt's lawyer friend Phil on the phone

447
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
Says

448
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,343
He could have pause for a second and sitting in the next thing out of his mouth was

449
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
Yeah that's actually a good question

450
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,183
So they start looking into it

451
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,743
And they find a Supreme Court case from 2000

452
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
12

453
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:47,167
In that particular case the court was looking at whether the government needed a warrant to attach a GPS tracker to your car

454
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
The question was

455
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,495
Is the government trespassing

456
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,847
Like if the feds going to your house against your will without a warrant

457
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
That is an unreasonable

458
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,431
So how about your car

459
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
And the justice is God

460
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
Really worked up over this question

461
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,551
Here's Chief Justice John Roberts

462
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Grilling the governor

463
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
Women's lawyer

464
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
If you

465
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
Put a GPS device on

466
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
All of our cars

467
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,487
Monitored arm movements for a month

468
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,047
You think you're entitled to do that under your theory

469
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
Are the justices of Discord

470
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Yes

471
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,263
Under our Theory and under this Court's cases

472
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,663
The justices of this court when driving on public roadways have no greater expectation your answer is yes no

473
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
Problem on the coast

474
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,479
Equally

475
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
Needless to say the government lost

476
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
Very bad

477
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
9

478
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
The Supreme Court said

479
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,159
Attaching a GPS to your car

480
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
Does count as a search

481
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,231
So the government needs to go to war

482
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Before they do that

483
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,863
So I didn't feel are looking at this and thinking we might just have a case

484
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,423
Drawing a chalk line on your tire to

485
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,703
Pacu is

486
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
Kinda like sticking a GPS on your

487
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
Define plaintiff

488
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,311
Someone who's got a

489
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
714 tickets

490
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,663
And they decide to sue the city of Saginaw

491
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
And

492
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,503
The parking enforcement officer that Matt calls quote

493
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
One of the most

494
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
Efficient government employees that has

495
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Ever

496
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:14,975
So there is actually three enforcement officers although this particular lady who is the defendant in our suit

497
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
Hodgkins

498
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
She writes

499
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,119
Well over 95% of the tickets

500
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,167
Did she have the same job

501
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
As to other people and she's running

502
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
Circles around

503
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
Correct

504
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,639
If this if this parking enforcement thing goes south for her

505
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,503
We reached out to Saginaw as lawyer they did not

506
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
Soap Manville

507
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
File their loss

508
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,647
They argue chalking your car is a violation of the

509
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
The 4th amendment

510
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
It

511
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
Is an unreasonable search

512
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,559
Where it goes from there is a little bit technical but basically

513
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,887
This week a federal court weighed in and said

514
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
This case has Merit

515
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
Let's send it to trial so

516
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
Arguments over this

517
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,799
Chalk question will begin soon

518
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,359
It just seems so small

519
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
You know

520
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
But is it really that small

521
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
I mean you're talking

522
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
Nationwide

523
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,599
Now you're talkin tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars

524
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,672
End in fines that are being posed on citizen

525
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,696
Something really is it

526
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
I mean I guess

527
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
Washes off

528
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,328
Yeah I mean the chocolate self yes

529
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
To be clear

530
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:30,752
Is Matt wins he wants to force little towns and cities across the country to refund all those billions of dollars in parking

531
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
And he hopes

532
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,336
Pay him that's what he stands to gain

533
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
But he also says

534
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,408
This is not a frivolous lawsuit

535
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:41,504
This is about privacy and which government actions were protected again

536
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,344
If you imagine that protection like a bubble around someone

537
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:50,208
That dude that's your safe Zone and if the government wants to get in that bubble they have to have a warrant

538
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,024
How big that bubble is

539
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
Is always chain

540
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
The bubble can shrink

541
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
That bubble can expand

542
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
And

543
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,264
When excitement is in these kind of cases is right on the edge of the bubble

544
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,336
Is the bubble going to go out in this case or is it going to retract in the

545
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,664
Is casein in in the Fourth Amendment protections are going to become smaller

546
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
Or I guess the third option is

547
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,088
Traffic enforcement officers just will chalk around the tire and not on a

548
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,440
So be at least they're within the bounds of the law

549
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,280
Matt says he cannot believe how much people seem to care about

550
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Parking

551
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,376
Of all the cases he's done and he's done things about much bigger issue

552
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,448
None of them have come close to getting this much attention

553
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,776
