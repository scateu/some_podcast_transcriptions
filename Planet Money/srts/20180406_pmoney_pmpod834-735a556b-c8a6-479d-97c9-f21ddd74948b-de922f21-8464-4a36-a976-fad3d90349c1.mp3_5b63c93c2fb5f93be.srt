00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:04,352
Hello I am Karen Duffin and I am new here at Planet Money

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:09,728
Hello and welcome to Planet Money Karen Duffin he really did say that to me to everybody

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,056
Karen started with us about what 18 days ago

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,360
And we asked her to look into

5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,640
Non-disclosure

6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,688
Something we've been hearing a lot about NDA

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:19,968
And as if

8
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,528
To prepare myself for this I had just signed one

9
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,832
It was part of my NPR Employment contract

10
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,136
Is pretty standard stuff but

11
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,440
Can actually tell you the details because

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
It says I can't

13
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,792
Think I probably 5-2 I think you did

14
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,608
So I start digging into nda's and

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,912
Somewhere deep in this rabbit hole

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,936
I kind of figured into

17
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,216
Pothead territory

18
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,496
I started to think

19
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,032
Actually kind of

20
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,056
Crazy if you

21
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,336
Really think about it that

22
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,128
You can buy Style

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,456
You can calculate what that silence is worth and buy it

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
And I got it I do

25
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,064
I worked in Silicon Valley for a decade in

26
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,856
I know that companies makes

27
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:01,696
I think it makes sense that they should for the most part be allowed to say

28
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,000
You employee can I tell the world about it

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,328
But over the past year I watched as

30
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:12,960
Me to cross my social media feeds many breaking their Silence about harassment for the first time

31
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,776
I felt a little bad about this

32
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
But I was surprised

33
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,616
It just how many people I know

34
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,152
But I didn't know that about

35
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
So

36
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,504
As I studied nda's

37
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
Spoke with

38
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,576
Women who signed them women have broken them

39
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
Lawyers

40
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,440
My mind just kept bouncing between my Silicon Valley Days

41
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,976
And these me two days

42
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
I started to think weight

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
How did we go from there

44
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,376
From protecting corporate secrets

45
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,704
To this world in which you can buy someone Silence about something

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
Add you've done

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,776
Like sexual harassment or assault

48
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,944
How did we get to that place with nda's also what happens if you break one

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,064
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I Am Karen Duffin

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
And today on the show

51
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,160
We go in search of answers for those questions

52
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
How did this happen

53
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,840
What happens if you break an NDA we talked to one of the most famous NDA Breakers of all time

54
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
And we learn a few things

55
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:18,752
Maybe just maybe could help people who want out of an NDA to get out legally

56
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,128

Is children more information is available at aecf. Org

60
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,512
To find out how we got to this place where

61
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,792
Nda's are being

62
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Weaponized essentially

63
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
Plate to cover up bad back

64
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
We started with this question

65
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,960
Where did Indians come from to begin with

66
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,264
I called Elie mystal to help me answer that

67
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,336
He is the editor of the website above the law

68
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
And the legal editor of the

69
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
Excellent podcasts more perfect

70
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
He's also the most

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,736
Entertaining La person I know

72
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,552
You got to remember like why nda's exist at all

73
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
And it's not

74
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
Really so that

75
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,696
You can get away with sexually harassing women

76
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,280
Wait a minute I know it seems like

77
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,400
That's not really why they were invented right they were invented to protect trade secret

78
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,984
Ellie says they weren't really created to silence whistleblowers

79
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
Okay so then the question of how did they

80
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,336
Become a tool to silence whistleblowers

81
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,408
We took that question to the head of the national whistleblower center

82
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
Steve Kerr

83
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
He says that shift can be traced

84
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,272
To the rise of

85
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
Title 7

86
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Title 7

87
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,904
It was created to prohibit workplace discrimination

88
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:45,280
Which meant that more employees started suing their companies for workplace discrimination

89
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
It opened up employers to

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Liability

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
So why not use an NDA

92
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
To make

93
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,216
That liability

94
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
Harder to prove

95
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
Employers were already using nda's

96
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
Flip the standard Joplin

97
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Talked about earlier

98
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
Birthday thought

99
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,248
We're getting sued by all of these people why do we also use this

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
Keep people silent

101
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
About bad things

102
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
Dancing snowball

103
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,160
So you saw this rise of x

104
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
Greenlee abusive nda's

105
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
That not

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Only

107
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,303
You said you can't communicate

108
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
But put specific

109
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,655
Requirements to help

110
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
Companies

111
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
Cover up

112
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
Misconduct

113
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,543
Okay so that's more people are signing these

114
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
Which leads us to our next big question

115
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
What happens if you break an NDA

116
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
Help me answer this question we are going to tell you a story

117
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
A story

118
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
Maybe you think you heard

119
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
They're afraid of yuan

120
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,415
That is Al Pacino and Russell Crowe from the movie

121
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,743
The Insider

122
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,559
And at that point I was like cool the movie

123
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
That's about

124
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,143
A heroic journalist from 60 minutes

125
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,215
Getting the ultimate Insider to blow the whistle

126
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
On big tobacco

127
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,823
But we watching it now for this story

128
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,383
You realize all no no no no

129
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
This is a movie about non-disclosure

130
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
Case in point

131
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,807
The following is all from the first half of the movie

132
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,207
Signed a confidentiality agreement have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement

133
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:23,327
Confidentiality is confidentiality

134
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,679
Most of those were Russell Crowe playing the character Jeffrey wigand

135
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
The real life person who broke

136
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,799
Big mean NDA from Big tobacco

137
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
As you look back

138
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Was it worth it

139
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Hell yes

140
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Wow

141
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
This is the real Jeffrey wigand

142
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
And that is a hell yes

143
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
With the huge ass

144
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
So you know

145
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
Your life will never be the same

146
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,303
In the late 80s early 90s Jeff was a vice president at Brown & Williamson or BMW

147
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
Which is a big Tobacco Company

148
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
This was an unexpected

149
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,751
The career move Jeff is a scientist who worked in healthcare for 20 years before that

150
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,567
He agreed to join the Tobacco Company because

151
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,151
They told him that they wanted his help making safer cigarette

152
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
And the pay was great

153
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,319
Subject takes the job and he's presented with a pretty basic employment and ta that says you know

154
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
Certain parts of his work have to be kept confidential

155
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
He's like a cool

156
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Signed it

157
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
But within just three months

158
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,583
The company's lawyers sitting down and they pant MD

159
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Talking points

160
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
1

161
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
That nicotine is not addictive

162
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
2

163
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
There is no science

164
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
It says that

165
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Smoking

166
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
Jeff obviously

167
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
Not agree with this

168
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
What did you say to them

169
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
I'm from the Bronx

170
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
I just said

171
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
I will tell you what I said but I

172
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,415
I think you may figure out what I say

173
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
Essentially you said screw you

174
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,815
And 4 years of tussling between Jeff the scientist and the

175
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
Tobacco lawyers

176
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
And Jeff gets

177
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
No at this point Jeff

178
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,239
He's not thinking about breaking his NDA to become a whistle blow

179
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
His NDA was tied to

180
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
Severance package

181
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
And his health

182
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,871
Which was especially important

183
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
Because one of his daughters

184
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
With chronically ill

185
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
Until he's going on just

186
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,039
Trying to put his life back together when BMW Susan

187
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,879
The company had heard that it's some point Jeff at talked about his Severn

188
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
Which is

189
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,975
Technically a violation of his employment NDA

190
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
It was true he had done this

191
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,119
And just company use this relatively small technical Violator

192
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Pressure him

193
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
Into signing a new end

194
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
NDA

195
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
On steroid

196
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
If I find a zoo

197
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
Draconian agreement

198
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
I couldn't talk about anything

199
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
Sing without first talking to them

200
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
Talk about

201
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Which is to say

202
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:56,159
Not just keep the company Secrets but if anyone ever asks him to talk about tobacco at all he had to

203
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
Tell pnw

204
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Who asked

205
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,023
What he's going to say and they can even come along with him

206
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
If they want

207
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,863
And this brings us to the first lesson of Jeff story

208
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,447
Even an NDA that seems like it is buying

209
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
Kind of innocuous Isla

210
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Can become a web

211
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
That small violation

212
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
The first NDA

213
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,919
Became a tool to get Jeff to sign that NDA on steroids

214
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
And where is Calais

215
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
This happens all the

216
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,271
And it worked in Jeff case

217
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
He says he felt like he had no choice

218
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
Mostly because of his daughter's illness

219
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
He really needed his Healthcare

220
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
So

221
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
He signs

222
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,487
Then a few things started

223
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
To happen

224
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,583
Jeff remembers for one getting these Anonymous phone calls

225
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
Like what did they say

226
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,911
Tobacco alone

227
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
My children

228
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,591
And later Jeff would find himself

229
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,407
Followed and it was never proved who did this

230
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
But a bullet wound up his mailbox

231
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,783
The intimidation terrified Jeff but it also pissed him off

232
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
And then one day

233
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
He turned on his teeth

234
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,927
TV NEC 7 tobacco Executives testifying before Congress

235
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,487
Congressman

236
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,375
Cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic definitions of the dictionary

237
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
Hard to remember now

238
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,751
But there was a time when people were not 100% clear about that fat

239
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
But Jeff with Crystal Clear

240
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,639
She's a scientist and she had been a vice president at a tobacco

241
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
He has information that would

242
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
Totally refute that lie

243
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,343
And he had started breaking the NDA in private

244
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,903
PT been Consulting with politicians

245
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
The Food Drug Administration Department

246
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Justice

247
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
And he had not told his company about the

248
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,071
Dislike his Mega NDA required

249
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Came to do

250
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
We're going public that

251
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Is it different

252
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,751
Jeff knows that if he does go public his company

253
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
Will definitely know and he might lose his

254
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
Health insurance

255
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
Interceptor

256
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,943
You also might get sued for some ungodly amount of money

257
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,503
But at some point those costs were

258
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,063
Just not worth the price of staying silent

259
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Not for jackets

260
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
I decided I would tell 60 Minutes everyday

261
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,839
And this brings us to the second lesson from Jeff's

262
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,911
Nda's are not just used to silence The Whistleblower

263
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,727
They can also be used to try and silence the whistle

264
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,799
Somehow Ronnie Williamson got word that Jeff was talking to

265
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
60 minutes

266
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
And they threaten to sue CVS

267
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,687
For what CBS was afraid could be billions

268
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Dollars

269
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,527
To CBS decides to kill the story and

270
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,855
60 Minutes host Mike Wallace even goes on air and

271
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Kind of apologize

272
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,231
We learned of a tobacco Insider who might know the whole story

273
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,559
But we cannot broadcast what critical information

274
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
He might be able to offer

275
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Why

276
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,703
Because he had to sign a confidentiality agreement

277
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,495
With the tobacco company he work for

278
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,335
An innocent CBS was also afraid

279
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
Jeff wigand

280
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
NDA

281
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
The movie version

282
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,991
Of Mike Wallace explains why he was okay killing the store

283
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
Well what do you think

284
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:08,671
I'm going to resign in protest to force it on the air the answer's no I don't plan to spend the end

285
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,743
My days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio

286
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
Mike

287
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Ouch

288
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
But here here is the final lesson from Jeff wigand story

289
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,935
Justice nda's contain technicalities

290
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,263
I can get you into trouble if you accidentally violate them bike

291
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
For example talking about your severance

292
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
They're also technicalities

293
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
That might make an NDA breakable

294
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Legally

295
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:36,063
Jeffy giving a deposition at some point that included a lot of damning information about

296
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
The tobacco in

297
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
And the Wall Street Journal have gotten hold of this.

298
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
Position and publish part of it

299
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,791
This is one of the ways an NDA can be deemed unenforced

300
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,607
If the information is already on the public record

301
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,983
And with that CBS becomes a lot less scared of Jeffrey wigand Zindagi

302
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
Brown Williamson's representation

303
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,871
Clearly missed a what they calmly knew his language within the company

304
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,919
60 Minutes decides it is

305
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
Now legally okay

306
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
To run their interview with Jeff White

307
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,551
Delivery device for nicotine

308
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
A delivery device

309
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
But in your mouth Light It Up

310
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
And you going to get your fix

311
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
How did that feel

312
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Stream

313
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Huh

314
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
What do you mean

315
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
The longer might

316
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
Volume now

317
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Describe

318
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:33,663
Jeff is credited with helping Force the tobacco industry into a multibillion-dollar settlement

319
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,711
Which was a game-changer

320
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,271
And how Americans understood the dangers of tobacco

321
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:44,671
And the fact that we live in a world where no one questions whether or not smoking is bad for you just helped make that

322
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
As part of that big settlement

323
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,535
Jeff's former company agreed to drop their lawsuit

324
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
I told you that

325
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,631
Is ultimately how Jeff got out of his non-disclosure

326
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
So he didn't really face legal consequences

327
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,239
What does for breaking his NDA

328
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
But we wondered

329
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
If he had an

330
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,335
Four other people who break their ears

331
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,895
What punishments can the law impose

332
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
What's on NBA breaker

333
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:10,271
Curse if you violating NDA there is a penalty it is not

334
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Jail

335
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
Again legal expert Elie mystal

336
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
We do not throw you

337
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,439
And the Iron Maiden for breaching a contract

338
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
And this is because an NDA is a sibling

339
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,815
Until Agreements are mostly settled by paying.

340
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,399
Could a person that changes their mind about and then DIA

341
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
It becomes a math problem

342
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Right

343
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:32,031
If you breach the NDA there's a penalty you decide

344
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
If you want to pay that penalty

345
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
You decided that's worth it

346
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,175
99% of the time

347
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,247
The penalty for breaking an indie 8 is not jail.

348
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
It is money

349
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,855
But it can quickly become about much more than money

350
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Because

351
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,183
You've probably just made someone in power

352
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
Very angry

353
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,255
And so it is always risky to break

354
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
But

355
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,607
We discovered that it isn't a prison

356
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
There are these little Escape hatches

357
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
Explain a few of them

358
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
Support also comes from Fidelity Investment

359
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591

366
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,023
I asked Elie mystal

367
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
Is there a way to break an NDA

368
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Legally

369
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,911
Well now we get into my hair part of the NBA conversation

370
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,983
Which is whether or not the NBA was enforceable

371
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
To begin with

372
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
One of the

373
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
Problems that people get into

374
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,663
Is that they think the sign contract is Gospel

375
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,759
But actually there are a lot of reasons and NBA might be unenforceable it's

376
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,343
Tobago or the information it covers is already in the public domain

377
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,903
Or maybe the other side breaks it themselves

378
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,695
Also nda's

379
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,511
Can never prohibit you from talking to law enforcement

380
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Ever

381
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,095
And even if that NDA is enforceable

382
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,167
The damage is hanging over the NBA might not be

383
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
So for example

384
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
The Stormy Daniels non-disclosure

385
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,055
She was paid $130,000

386
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,103
Can a lawyer threaten to sue her

387
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
420 million dollars

388
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
Breaking it

389
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
But

390
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,479
If that ever actually went to court

391
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
She's probably not going to be up

392
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
That is under

393
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,159
Unconscionable on its face unconscionable

394
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,207
Is actually also a legal standard

395
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,767
You cannot have damages

396
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,839
They're so out of whack with what the initial contract

397
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Was for

398
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
That those damages wood

399
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
Quotes shock the conscience

400
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
I left that we have these

401
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:43,615
Legal words that sound like a southern woman declare that is unconscionable

402
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,199
If the damages give you the vapors then

403
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,503
Those aren't necessarily going to be enforced

404
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
But so

405
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
Sure this may be

406
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
There's a hole

407
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,415
Slew of things that you can't find a way

408
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,719
But people don't necessarily know that

409
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,559
Right right and especially the person signing it usually doesn't know that right

410
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
So most people stay silent

411
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Because I have to

412
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,191
But there are laws

413
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
They can help people void their

414
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
If the secret

415
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
That person is

416
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Hertz other

417
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
These laws are a bit of a patchwork

418
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
A very States

419
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,479
In a federal ones are mostly industry-specific

420
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Laws

421
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
For example that

422
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,087
Let you report bad stuff in Sanitation

423
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
Food Aviation

424
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
Dozens of other specific thing

425
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
They're usually called whistleblower laws

426
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
Sometimes public policy exceptions

427
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
And as I studied these

428
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
In the midst of this me-too moment

429
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,191
I started to wonder to these exceptions

430
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,495
Extend to victims of sexual harassment

431
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:49,151
I'm not aware of any case law that says a sexual harassment NDA is invalid because it by

432
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
Violates public policy

433
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:56,319
This is Lisa Bloom an attorney that you may have heard of because she did very briefly join Harvey Weinstein's legal team

434
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:03,231
But she has spent the bulk of her career representing sexual harassment victims against powerful men like Bill O'Reilly

435
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Bill Cosby

436
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:10,911
I don't understand why sexual harassment doesn't live as a clear policy exception to NDA

437
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
It's probably because

438
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,847
Nobody has challenged it far enough to get to the Appellate level which is where legal precedent gets made

439
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
In other words

440
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,735
Someone has to fight it to the highest level of the Court's where rules can be made that apply to

441
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
To everyone who follow

442
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
It doesn't appear that

443
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
What happened yet

444
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,367
Ellie and Lisa both agree that

445
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
The reason for this is pretty simple

446
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
Kind of a bummer

447
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
But simple

448
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,255
I think you've partially answered your own question

449
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:41,119
They made a movie about that broke again

450
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,191
Like if you're if you're going to be the person to do this

451
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
This is your life

452
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
This is your whole life

453
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
Being this person

454
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,103
And being in real kind of legal Jeopardy

455
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
Trying to get

456
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
This standard

457
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Changed

458
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,783
Both in a court of law and in the court of public opinion

459
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
That's a heavy load

460
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,879
Text back to any one person

461
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:08,767
It's a load that many people very understandably do not want to carry and shouldn't have to

462
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
Many victims welcome into you

463
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,375
Stay but then get restitution and just move on with

464
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,239
For those who do want whistleblower laws to cover sexual harassment nda's

465
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Ellie says

466
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,799
I probably won't come through

467
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
For the courts

468
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,359
Like many whistleblower laws

469
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,151
And this is not something we say often

470
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
It may be easiest

471
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
To have the change come

472
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Through Congress

473
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
But so far

474
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,111
Whistleblower protections for reporting sexual harassment

475
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,951
Do not seem to have been established either by case law or statute

476
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Tori law

477
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
Far as I know right now

478
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:45,119
Whistleblowing about your company's culture of sexual harassment

479
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
It's just not in that talk

480
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Why

481
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,215
Cook Congress has

482
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,751
Not in its wisdom

483
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
Decided to elevate

484
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
People who are

485
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
Whistleblowing about

486
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,175
Harassment and assault

487
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
To the level of

488
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,015
Of a whistleblower who is

489
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,575
Yo talking about financial crimes

490
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,391
Or environmental disaster

491
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
We might be on the cusp of that

492
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
That might be the

493
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,839
The legal Legacy of me to for all we know to to change how we think about

494
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
At a

495
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
Statutory

496
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Level

497
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,007
And maybe it will there are a few signs that things are starting to happen

498
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
Some states

499
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,335
Are passing and modifying statue

500
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,151
It say you cannot use nda's

501
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
In sexual harassment or abuse

502
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,599
And tucked into the new federal tax law is the provision that disincentivizes the use of nda's in sexual

503
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
Harassment and abuse case

504
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,463
It says that if you decide to use an NDA

505
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,791
You can no longer deduct the cost of that settlement from your tax

506
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
So you know

507
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,375
Change can show up in unexpected places

508
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:59,615
If you have a secret that you think deserves telling please get in touch we are Planet Money

509
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
Npr.org also we have a super secret way to do that if you would like you can go to securedrop

510
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,319
Dot NPR. Org

511
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Money sent you

512
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,487
And it's probably obvious but we are not lawyers so if you are thinking of breaking an NDA you should call a lawyer

513
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,095
We could not have made the show without a wonderful intern Aviva dekornfeld

514
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,167
She puts this story she did a bunch of great reporting on it thank you

515
