1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,072
Not too long ago I was in Switzer

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,352
Geneva specifically

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:09,216
And of course while I was there I did the thing you are expected to do in Switzerland

4
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,496
I ordered fondue

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,544
Did the plane funding or

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,848
It is a weird meow when you think about it

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
Especially as a main dish

8
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,200
It is just melted cheese

9
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,248
N scale bread like that is it

10
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,552
Like something a divorced dad

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,088
Thought up to feed an 8 year old

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,160
Affect my weight or even came over with a spoon

13
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,952
So I can scrape out the bottom of the pot

14
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,488
The end of the phone

15
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,048
Is a the best part of the phone

16
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,096
Scrape off the cheese on the bottom

17
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,912
Yes because so famous in Switzerland

18
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:43,520
Since I was sadly eating alone I sat there goofing around on my phone

19
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,800
Like trying to answer this question

20
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,104
Googling history of fondue

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,664
And that's what I learned this whole fondue thing

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,944
He's Not What It Seems

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,248
The reason I was eating fondue

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,808
The reason that I even know about fondue

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,160
The reason I actually own unused fondue pot that I got as a wedding gift

26
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,440
All this goes back

27
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,232
Twin Shadow Association

28
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
Swatch Swiss

29
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
Cheese dealer

30
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:10,400
Achieve cartel the basically Ruled The Swiss economy for 80 years

31
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,680
Until fairly recently

32
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
Bicycle say Union

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,800
Which sounds scary until you hear the English translation

34
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,336
The Swiss cheese Union

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
The Swiss

36
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
Cheese Union

37
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:26,528
Is at the root of a fondue conspiracy

38
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,832

Well-meaning folks decide the rules of Economics do not apply to them

Episode of the fondue restaurant I discovered

57
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
That there is not much on the internet

58
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120
About the Swiss cheese Union

59
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
Four lines in Wikipedia

60
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
It was a group of all-powerful cheesemaker

61
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
The control prices and supply

62
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,824
Actually it's the kitchen of the restaurant I was at

63
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,640
A place that looks like it buys cheese by the ton

64
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
Can I ask to speak to one of the managers

65
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,248
Have you ever heard of the Swiss cheese Union

66
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
No never

67
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
No one talks about the Swiss cheese Union

68
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
I almost thought the whole thing was a hoax

69
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,696
Until I started to call various cheese groups

70
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Switzerland

71
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
And the response

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,304
We sort of like when you're in Italy and you ask

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
People about the mafia

74
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
They said

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,168
Oh we have nothing to do

76
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,192
Swiss Cheese near me

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Battlestations defunct

78
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,288
Guys are wearing at the probably really really old

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
We can't help you

80
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,152
I finally reached the guy of food historian named Dominic flammer

81
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
In Zurich

82
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
He said

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
No no I wasn't imagining it

84
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,576
No they don't want to talk to you because they are the survivors of this

85
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,856
Gianni Morales

86
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,696
And they know it has a bad reputation would I say when I say I want to talk to you about Swiss cheese

87
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
Yeah they don't talk about that

88
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,792
Dominic wrote this giant book on the

89
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
History of Swiss cheese

90
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:51,936
Even just a small chapter on the Swiss cheese Union got people upset

91
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
That was attacked

92
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,056
Buy old members of the Swiss cheese Union because I criticize them

93
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,384
But you know this is what did they say to you

94
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
They said I'm not patriotic enough

95
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:06,528
2 to write about swiss cheese and that I would not be allowed to

96
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:12,928
To tell a story because I would not help us with cheesemakers but in the end it's accepted today

97
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
That directs the truth and nothing but the

98
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
Here is the truth

99
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
According to Dominic

100
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
Like everything in Europe

101
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
The Story begins with World War 1

102
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,447
Construction death crippled economies

103
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,007
But the Swiss had a very different problem in the wrestler

104
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
The continent

105
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,311
They were neutral in the war

106
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
They survived World War One just fine

107
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,431
It is awesome cheese industry still intact

108
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,503
But the customers were gone the customers have been

109
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,319
We can export a lot of cheese before

110
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:46,719
But in the end of the first World War II and its pretation anymore

111
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
More elastic

112
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,815
Nearly till the end of the second World War

113
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
Yeah the time between the wars was

114
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Top

115
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,935
Tattoos all over Europe were starting to put up trade barriers

116
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
The global economy collapse

117
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
Lower cheese stopped

118
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,847
In Switzerland had to suddenly get by on just selling cheese

119
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
To themselves

120
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
Swiss customer

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,271
Usually this would mean that a lot of Swiss Dairy Farmers and cheese maker

122
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,807
Probably go bankrupt

123
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,903
But Switzerland came up with a way that everyone could stay in business

124
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
A way to protect themselves

125
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
That was the Swiss cheese you

126
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
It's what's known as the cartel

127
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
An agreement among competitors

128
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
Desktop computer

129
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Get rid of OPEC

130
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
He was like that

131
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Richie's

132
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Operating a cartel

133
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Is to get everyone

134
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
You have to make sure

135
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,103
Everyone every cheesemaker follows the rules

136
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
Swiss cheese Union took

137
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Charge

138
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
The union set the price for milk

139
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,807
I told dairyman how much milk to produce and who they could sell it to

140
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,623
They told the cheesemakers how much cheese to make

141
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
And then set the prices for the cheese

142
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
It's all so complicated

143
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
Is cheese business

144
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,071
Did they actually narrow down the number of cheeses that people could produce

145
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,655
Switzerland used to make over a thousand different kinds of cheeses

146
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
The chief Union

147
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
Supported

148
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
7

149
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
7 kinds of cheese

150
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Big 2

151
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
27 * 4

152
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
It's the biggest one with the hose

153
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,455
The outlet the second one the biggest one of the oldest Spanish is to gruyere

154
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,503
And all this was done by the way

155
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
With the approval of the Swiss government

156
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
Leaving kicked in taxpayer dollars

157
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
They subsidize the cheese

158
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
Swiss cheese Union basically

159
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,999
When every little part of the industry

160
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
And no one could afford to cross the

161
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
People did

162
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
Dominic Show me the picture of a guy named

163
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Varmint

164
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,983
He he was the cheese Rebel

165
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
And Dominic said you know

166
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
He only lives an hour away

167
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
You should go visit

168
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:44,735
Okay I'm going to be completely honest with you

169
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
This surprised me about Switzer

170
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
I knew

171
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
The cowbells exist

172
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
But I didn't think

173
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
They were actually attached

174
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
To the cows

175
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,975
These days in the days of GPS but

176
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
It is true they do wear the belt

177
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
In Switzerland

178
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,887
Really does look like it does on the chocolate wrapper

179
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,447
The Rolling Green Hills the chalets

180
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,519
Brown and white spotted cows he's insanely beautiful

181
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,335
Cows but at this moment seemed very much

182
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
In love

183
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
With the cheese wrap

184
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199
These are my girls your girls

185
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,063
The cheese Rebel brought along his son Lucas tell Translate

186
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,391
I told him I was still stunned by how beautiful

187
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
This area was

188
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,231
This is exactly how people pictures Switzerland do not right

189
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
Yeah yeah I guess that's that

190
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
Aristocat marketing thing

191
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,679
Lucas's father Sapp had his run-in with the Swiss cheese Union decade

192
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
I still like to tell the story

193
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
This area of Switzerland

194
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
Was always known for its

195
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Particular Cheese's

196
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,359
Is a special frying cheese

197
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Pronounce

198
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
Autosprint

199
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
Which Lucas describes as

200
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,503
Little like parmesan from Italy

201
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
The cheese Rebels has no no it is better

202
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,183
Take me down into their cheesehaus down a spiral staircase

203
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
Into the cellar

204
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
And bear of the cheese

205
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,607
How do you picture swiss cheese and I know how you feel

206
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
Swiss cheese

207
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
Hard stuff

208
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
This

209
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Is differin

210
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,751
They're tiny wheels of soft

211
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287

212
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,359
Daenerys deep golden brown aged Wheels

213
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
This this right here

214
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
This was the problem

215
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,503
Sep wasn't in the making the really big popular cheese

216
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
At the time he wanted to make Spritz

217
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
Justin Smoak

218
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:32,511
Yeah it was his favourite to be produced it forever

219
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
For the cheese Rebel

220
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
To decide

221
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,607
Only the Swiss cheese Union was loud

222
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,655
Decision about who made what

223
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
In Switzerland

224
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
A large part of the country was now producing just those

225
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
2 classic

226
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Emmental and gruyere

227
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
Springs with a loud

228
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,943
WhatsApp how to apply to the Swiss cheese Union in burn for a license to make the cheese

229
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,527
And it took about eight years until he received

230
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
Final m

231
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
Information for them years

232
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
80s

233
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
El Felix

234
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:06,815
Application paper

235
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,375
8 years of applications and appeals

236
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
And the answer from the Swiss cheese Union

237
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Was no

238
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
You cannot make Sprint

239
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
You can't sell it you can't export it

240
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
Why exactly

241
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,407
It's hard to know in the letter they said only quote

242
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,223
You do not fit into the envisaged structure

243
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
They say

244
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
You are

245
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
Toledo

246
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,903
I I I'm too too too small

247
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,767
It's worth noting that Switzerland is and what's the time a modern liberal

248
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,119
By this time it had open competition in baking and Hi-Tech Industries

249
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
But if you wanted to make Sprint

250
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,239
Then you had to apply for 8 years and you had to accept no for an answer

251
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
Power of a cartel

252
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
As for the cheese Rebel

253
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,383
At this point he had nothing to lose

254
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
He started to experiment

255
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
Mickey's tinysoft

256
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
Traditional cheeses

257
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
No one had seen or try for years and

258
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
It said he couldn't help the big distributors or export it

259
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
He sold them one by one

260
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
The hotels in small rest

261
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
This cheese was called stands or flat

262
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
It would later become famous

263
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,119
After the chief cartel was destroyed and step could export again

264
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
I'm getting ahead of the story

265
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
Because we haven't gotten

266
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215

00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
Well that part of the story

268
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031

You can find us on the NPR one app or wherever you get your pot

284

The 1950s Switzerland started exports

285
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,871
And with all these subsidies and everyone making the same identical cheese

286
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
Swiss cheese Union needed to come up with something

287
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
New

288
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,503
Achieve cartel does not prosper

289
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,551

290

Square crackers

00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,135
They need to find a way to get people to eat

292
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Cheese by the bucket

293
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
Dominik flammer says they looked around

294
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,047
And it wasn't one dish that some small towns in the Alps

295
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Used to eat

296
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
What you know

297
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
Melted cheese always very popular in the Alps

298
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,495
It was when you when you were producing on an Alpine slope cheese

299
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,591
And even you had to melt some to some cheese if you wanted to have something warm to eat

300
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,455
And in the in the 50s they found out that if they want to sell

301
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,271
Overproduction of Swiss cheese

302
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,319
They started to

303
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,135
Search for recipes that cute

304
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
The couch help to

305
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
To to sell morphe

306
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
I'm sure you've already guessed

307
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,815
A big pot of emmental perhaps and gruyere

308
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Stale bread

309
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
Fondue with you

310
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
If we could sell it with a traditional

311
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
A story behind it

312
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,567
To show that cheese was a very healthy food from the Alps

313
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,895
They were using the images of Heidi Heidi land 2

314
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,735
Because this is a story everybody knew worldwide because it was translated

315
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:11,135
And they took this image of Heidi they they used it also to make publicity for a fun day but

316
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
I think the tide you ever ate founded

317
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
She ever existed

318
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
Heidi is not real

319
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,095
And neither is this over-the-top enthusiasm for fondue

320
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,423
Dominique told me that Swiss people maybe a fondue few times

321
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
Definitely in the winter or maybe at a party

322
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,311
Ben swiss cheese ads fondue with life of every party

323
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
Good looking

324
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,175
Healthy shoveling cheese in their mouths who didn't want to be Swiss

325
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,527
I thought we had agreed that by the 1970s we are in a period of

326
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Peak fondue

327
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
If you grew up in the 70s

328
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Maybe you remember

329
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
Little red fondue pot

330
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
What the color coded for

331
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
McKenna's turnout

332
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
Whole Contraption Gathering dust

333
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
Up in the shelves

334
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
This was the Glory Days for

335
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
Swiss cheese

336
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
The cartel

337
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Had one

338
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,727
And I picture them all having like a Swiss

339
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
Fondue party celebrating the Vic

340
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
Swiss cheese around the world

341
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
And perhaps when they're having a party they did not notice

342
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
It's Switzerland itself

343
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
Was Che

344
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,735
Which one was no longer

345
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Dairy Farmers

346
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Raising cows

347
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
They were scientist making cancer drug

348
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
They were engineers making these

349
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Cool tunneling machine

350
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:22,559
And the notion of the Swiss government was spending so much effort and money to help out the cheese Union

351
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
Start a bug

352
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:30,239
I guess in the sixties and seventies the cheese-making is with milk producing in Twisted Switzerland

353
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,335
Cost of dissuade State more than than the whole cost for the army of

354
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,175
There's been more on cheese than on the arm

355
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,991
That's what they did okay the Swiss Army is not

356
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
That big

357
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,855
But the point here is that agricultural subsidies were taking up a huge

358
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
Share of the budget

359
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,439
And then we had a

360
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
A kind of Siri

361
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
Theories of corruption

362
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
Problems within the Swiss cheese Union big surprise

363
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
People who were caught

364
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Stealing money

365
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,799
Then we went to jail

366
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
By the end of the 1990s

367
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
Swiss cheese Union was gone

368
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
It was disbanded

369
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,735
The Swiss government continue to subsidize dairies and farmers

370
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
Cheesemakers all the sudden had to

371
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,671
I wasn't able to get in touch with any former officials from the Swiss cheese Union

372
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,487
I did find some cheese makers used to be inside the Union

373
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,839
Arena Peter Parker made emmental during the Glory Days

374
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
They still do make emmental

375
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
But now they only make the cheese every other day

376
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
The prices plummeted

377
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,775
Are the neighbors used to run cheese operations

378
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
Nonna's cheese houses

379
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Now

380
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,895
150

381
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
House

382
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Who makes

383
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
Ontology

384
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
To be much more

385
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,575
English pit mix

386
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,367
Peter old Pepsi founded

387
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,671
For 500

388
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
House

389
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,999
Out of business

390
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
Needless to say they do miss the subs

391
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
They missed the steady price

392
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
Now she says almost look amazement

393
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Cheese distributors

394
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,567
Only by former it very low prices and if she doesn't sell to them her neighbors will

395
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
The competition

396
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
Meanwhile the cheese Rebel

397
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,199
Is now just another swiss cheese maker

398
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
When the cartel collapse

399
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,063
Sup was suddenly allowed to sell the unique cheese get been working on

400
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
He could export them

401
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Anywhere you wanted to

402
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
I can buy a beer in Manhattan

403
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,743
I just yesterday I stopped into Fairway at the local supermarket

404
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,303
Can I talk to the cheese guy James Coogan

405
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
It's amazing

406
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
He says

407
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
There has been annexed

408
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
Explosion of new cheeses from Switzerland

409
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983
We have now available to us some

410
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
Really cool stuff other than

411
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
Gruyere

412
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
Amazon

413
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,175
You know what your everyday absolutely important cheeses

414
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
But this stuff

415
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Beautiful

416
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Sexy

417
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Delicious

418
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
That's something you going to see everywhere

419
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,439
He told me he'd vaguely heard of the Swiss cheese cartel

420
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,743
But it doesn't really come up much anymore

421
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
Before you write in

422
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,495
Tell me how much you love fondue I will say for the record

423
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,799
I finished the entire pot a fondue

424
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:19,199
But I actually pretty good if you'd like to write in about anything on Planet Money

425
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,271
Email us Planet Money at npr.org
