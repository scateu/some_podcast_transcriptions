1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,304
Every once in awhile I

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,072
Take

3
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:05,120
Track train from New York to Washington

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,728
And the train goes through a couple cities that are doing really well they

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,032
Your fancy new buildings along with Skyline

6
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,336
But Amtrak also goes through bolts

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,616
In Baltimore so different

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:19,200
It is a city that is shrinking it's lost about 30

9
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,992
Percent of its population since 90

10
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,016
70

11
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,112
And what that means when the train goes through you see that Baltimore has all of these abandon

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:26,880
Buildings

13
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,280
So there's one block in particular that you can actually see from the train window it is the 900 block

14
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
North Bradford

15
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,864
And it's he's 17

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,264
Skinny two storey row houses that are all boarded up and they look basically like ruin

17
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,312
But every time I see them I wonder

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,104
Why doesn't Baltimore just

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
Tear those house

20
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,736
So couple of months ago I started going to Baltimore to ask about that

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,880
And I found out that there are a bunch of people including like everyone in the neighborhood

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,440
Really want this block to be tomorrow

23
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,232
Their leader

24
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,512
Is a woman named Janice

25
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,536
Jacob's Hudson

26
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,560
She has been around in this neighbor

27
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
Brotherhood forever

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,888
And talking to her you realize

29
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,680
She just knows everyone

30
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,960
Miss Savannah

31
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,520
Who was the older lady she would come outside

32
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,056
And it won't heal or apron

33
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
Woke up on a drug dealer in my neighborhood over you know yeah she did yes she did

34
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,784
Janice has been on a mission

35
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
Years

36
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,088
To get the city to tear this

37
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
Calling

38
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
Going downtown

39
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,024
Being a thorn in their side I was a nuisance and I know I was

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
I meant Janice one afternoon at the place she hangs out which is an abandoned Factory that's been turned into a commune

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
Unity center it's about four blocks from North Braddock

42
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,080
And we were sitting by the window and talking and all of a sudden

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
Poppin

44
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
It's really hard to hear it at first

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Those gunshots

46
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,296
We got back from the windows

47
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
And then there were more shots

48
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,184
Okay

49
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
1 2 3 4

50
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
So let me make a call

51
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,632
While Janice was calling I looked over her shoulder at her

52
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,168
Her phone and she's got like

53
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,728
10 names in her contacts that start with

54
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
Major

55
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,520
Those are the names

56
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,568
The cops guy she knows personally

57
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
Has she called one of them

58
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,640
Listen I'm in the building right

59
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,712
Sound like gunshots coming from down there in the

60
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,016
900 block of Rose Street

61
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:36,416
Y'all got that okay good we're coming from a different place

62
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,232
But also one that has a bunch of abandoned house

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
Ingenesis

64
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,328
This is kind of her point right

65
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,376
You got all these empty houses

66
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,680
Emmys are places where drug dealers

67
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,496
Come and they hang out and they hide out

68
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,104
And then it's like 3:30 on a random Wednesday afternoon and people are shooting at each

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,040
Over the past six months I spent a lot of time on North Bradford

70
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
Like a lot of

71
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:11,488
And I think I have figured out why it is so hard to tear down not just 17 empty

72
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
Houses on a block and bolts

73
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,584
But why it is so hard to knock down

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,448
The millions of vacant houses in shrinking cities all across the United States

75
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,288

95
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,775
I am from a small town in Upstate New York jail

96
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
Crow hunks in trunks

97
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,199
Kerhonkson is one of those little towns that used to have a

98
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
Blooming summer tours

99
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Industry

100
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,879
But in the 70s tourist stop coming to kerhonkson and they left behind all of these

101
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,695
Abandoned hotels and bungalows

102
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,767
And as a result I kind of love abandoned buildings

103
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
When I was a little kid

104
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
I didn't have so many friends

105
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:58,239
And I used to break into the building I would crawl in through a window and then I would

106
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
Hangout

107
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
So that

108
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:05,663
Is totally alien from my experience of being a little kid I grew up in Suburban San Diego

109
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
So basically in the 70s

110
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
When people were moving out of

111
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,855
Towns like Crow Hawks in New York they were moving into towns like Escondido California

112
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
Growing and building an empty field across the

113
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
Filled up with house

114
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
And economically

115
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,863
That's good you want people to leave places where there aren't too many jobs like

116
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
Pro hunks in trunks

117
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
Kerhonkson

118
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,727
I moved to places where it where there are jobs

119
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Apps like San Diego

120
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
But there is this problem right

121
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,663
When all those people leave save kerhonkson or Baltimore for that matter

122
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,735
You want to be able to knock down the buildings they left behind

123
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,831
You're one of my earliest memories Jacob is one year some people

124
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:50,207
Set one of the abandoned hotels on fire I can actually remember seeing the Flames through the woods

125
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
Okay abandoned buildings

126
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Crime

127
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,583
Take me back to Baltimore with last we left they were going to

128
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,679
Writing so Dennis and I got away from the windows and she called the police

129
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
Evan a couple minutes later

130
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,543
It was all over went back to normal we went back to the windows

131
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
And Janis starts telling me the story

132
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,407
This goes back seven or eight

133
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Years

134
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
That is the first time Janice went to the city and said

135
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
Would you tear this block down

136
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
And she says

137
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
One of the guys from the city told her

138
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
He said James.

139
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
Discount expensive

140
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
I said I know

141
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
I know

142
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
I know

143
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
Of course

144
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
It's the money right

145
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
Bummer in this story but

146
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
Good news

147
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,191
In this story is with not really the money big day with this

148
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
Random lucky break

149
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
Or somebody from the city

150
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
Went to a Blythe

151
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
The conference which

152
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
Apparently the real thing

153
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,151
Found out there was this pot of money that came from some

154
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
Federal Mortgage

155
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Robo-signing

156
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
Scandal

157
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Settlements

158
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,063
And Baltimore got millions of dollars

159
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
First to knock down empty houses

160
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,671
And they put North Bradford this one block

161
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
At the top of their

162
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:59,839
Yeah and when you visit North Bradford you can see exactly why it's my first one in March

163
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:05,983
And went down the block and it is as bad as it looks from the train okay so we have

164
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
One boarded-up house

165
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,919
One not boarded-up house note it is bordered there are 17 houses on the Block even

166
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,223
Numbers 909 02904

167
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,343
They're covered with this ugly blue and brown and yellow fake Stone

168
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
It looks like something

169
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,951
That would be covering a castle I'd like a mini golf

170
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
So I poked around a little bit

171
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
924 looks like I could just go right in

172
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
How many try to do I can't help it

173
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
I tried the door in the paint flaking off

174
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
The door was like painted shut

175
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
So I gave up

176
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:46,687
I said after the gunshot sound like

177
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
Paradise Okay so

178
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
It's been

179
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
4 years

180
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:56,415
From the time Baltimore got the demolition might need to the time you started visiting this

181
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:03,327
But when you went there a few months ago the city of Baltimore had not yet knock down a single one of these

182
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,655
These houses the people in the neighborhood want them knock down to see has the money

183
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
What is the prop

184
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,055
To find out I went to the housing authority and I met a woman named Wendy Redfern Curtis

185
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
Wendy's part of a team whose

186
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
Job it is

187
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
To get these houses down

188
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
So I thought. Next door in a convo

189
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,271
Hertz room and she started explaining why it takes so long

190
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,367
She pulled out this color coded Municipal map of the block of North Bradford

191
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,695
And she says you know I actually know this neighborhood really well

192
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
My grandmother owned

193
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
9 Oaks

194
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
6 MI

195
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
Live at 9

196
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
96 Montford right here

197
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Show me on the map

198
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Right here

199
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,471
That's your grandmother's house was my grandmother's house

200
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
And this is Brad

201
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
She's made a lot of time in this area

202
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,871
She's a block she's a block away from it

203
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
And I have a

204
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
Ethel is across the sea

205
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
UPS

206
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Okay

207
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,831
Okay so this isn't this is kind of personal to business very personal

208
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,951
Wendy's job is erasing the neighborhood where she grew up

209
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,815
When she was a kid this neighborhood was full of people middle-class and working-class people

210
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,631
A lot of them worked for the Western Electric Company

211
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,215
And talking about it now makes Wendy a little sad

212
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
So my parents work for what

213
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Western Electric

214
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
It was a factory job

215
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,407
They didn't go to college they went to work straight from high school

216
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,199
They met they are they married

217
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,551
And then and this is a familiar story in a lot of us industrial cities

218
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,623
In 1982 Western Electric closed

219
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Plant

220
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
In

221
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
The cold of night

222
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
In like 1983 or 86

223
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,583
The same night I think the Colts left Baltimore

224
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
Western Electric decided that it

225
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
It was closing

226
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Plant

227
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
In Baltimore

228
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,775
So that meant that my family had to move

229
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
Cuz we need it jobs

230
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,895
A lot of other families move to

231
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,223
And those houses on North Bradford and houses around them started

232
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Empty out

233
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,295
Seeing her neighborhood

234
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Empty

235
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
Is really tough on my

236
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:07,487
But she knows that Baltimore needs to be a smaller City it is a smaller City

237
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
Those houses of got to be knocked down

238
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,095
And she is fired up to do it

239
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
What happened before this wasn't easy

240
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
This is awesome

241
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
Knocking down houses is awesome

242
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,079
But she told me there are two big reasons it's really hard to do

243
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:27,455
In the first one goes back to 924 North Bradford that the house where I tried to open the door

244
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,271
Wendy had this slideshow of the houses

245
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
And she showed me a picture of that house

246
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
See that

247
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
No curtain

248
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
No curtains

249
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,719
Not bored it's not for it's not open to Casual entry

250
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:44,863
But it doesn't look like anybody's living there hasn't been condemned to the city can't just knock it down

251
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,679
They have to actually buy the house from the owner

252
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Well guess what

253
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,495
Some of these owners have been missing

254
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
For decades

255
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
So the city has to track them down

256
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:59,967
Then they have to tell them we wanted to abolish then they have to negotiate a sale one of the houses

257
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,039
The owner was actually in Ethiopia

258
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:08,671
Ethiopia he was going to be back for another year yeah an infected Wendy and her colleagues three years

259
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
Words to get through this part of the process going out

260
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Playhouse

261
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
The owner make

262
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
I can feel to buy the house

263
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:18,399
And you said it was wet like about $10,000 they went to paying for each house yeah that's fair market value

264
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,263
And by December of last year Baltimore owned every single house on that block

265
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
And demolition

266
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,567
Could finally begin

267
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
There was just one

268
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
Last

269
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
I'm the last of the Mohican

270
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,991
This is Vanessa West

271
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
She's the last person living on this block

272
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,855
She rents number 930 which is

273
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
Just four houses over from the end

274
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,743
And one day last March I went down there Vanessa and I sat out on her stoop

275
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:49,375
It seems like her favorite pastime is basically just yelling to people from the neighborhood from her stew

276
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
List out

277
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
Asset

278
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,031
A bunch of ice creams around there to know about a week ago

279
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,615
Stop bigger assholes

280
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
She's 37 years old

281
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,271
Message is very lovable person

282
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,367
When I first met her down on the Block I thought she must be a holdout

283
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
She wants to stay here for some reason

284
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,719
It turns out I was totally wrong

285
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
Vanessa wants to leave

286
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
First of all four houses in really bad shape

287
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Unless

288
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:26,239
Spring not long before I met her there was a storm one night Vanessa was awake and she hears this big boom

289
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
House on North Bradford

290
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
I've literally falling over

291
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,175
I'm glad we're nobody called parked out here cuz it would have been total

292
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:39,039
You mean that the house actually fell into the street some of the stuff fell into

293
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,343
Chemistry summer fun on the side

294
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
This kind of games

295
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:50,815
Vanessa lives with her son and her grandkids she does not want them to get hit by a house

296
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
Vanessa really wants to move

297
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,775
But there's this federal law that uniform relocation assistance Act

298
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Do they call it gyro

299
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
Vmate

300
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:09,759
And it's a lot makes it very hard for Vanessa to move in fact it's another big part of the reason it is taking

301
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
So long to knock down these

302
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,111
Give this one was actually passed

303
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
2 / 2

304
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Text people like finesse

305
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,815
It was passed in the 70s after these big waves of Highway construction that ended up knocking down a lot of houses

306
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
Screwing over a lot of people who lived in those houses

307
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,287
And in a lot of ways the lot does what it's supposed to do it does protect people like Vanessa

308
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,359
I should get some money to help relocate

309
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,455
And also says if it's going to kick me out cuz her house is getting knocked out

310
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,295
The city must make sure Vanessa move someplace

311
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
Safe

312
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
Descent insanity

313
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,183
So last year Vanessa found a house that she really liked it was

314
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
Bigger it was newer

315
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
So yeah

316
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Ready

317
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
I think it'll be a good

318
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Bratz

319
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
Let me remove

320
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,447
But this house did not meet the requirements of

321
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,823
Yura or do you want whatever it didn't meet the requirements of this law that is supposed to

322
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
It wasn't

323
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
Safe and decent and sanitary under the

324
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,783
She's in a wheelchair and the house didn't have all the railings it was supposed to throw the city said no

325
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
You cannot move into that house in that

326
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,207
So when I started visiting North Bradford last spring

327
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,607
Everybody was just waiting on Vanessa and she was waiting for the landlord to get that house fixed up so

328
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
So she could move in

329
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,215
I called Vanessa once a week every week

330
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
And every week she said

331
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
It's about to happen

332
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
I'm about to move

333
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
God's will

334
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
God praise

335
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
I'll be gone next

336
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
Finally after a couple months of this

337
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
I basically said

338
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
I mean come on

339
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
Here's a minute of that phone call

340
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:56,255
What Miss Miss Vanessa what happens if things don't work out next week cuz I know we've been talking since April

341
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
And I know that you wanted to be

342
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,351
You thought you'd be out by December of last year

343
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
National

344
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
Don't don't don't

345
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Don't forget it like that

346
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,055
I have faith that I'll be out of here

347
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
You don't you don't want to

348
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
You don't want to talk about

349
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
About that

350
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
Bad stuff like

351
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Bad stuff

352
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,087
I called Vanessa the next week and she was still on North Bradford

353
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:25,439
And then in early June the city finally gave Vanessa the go-ahead

354
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
The house she had been waiting on with safe

355
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Indecent

356
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
Unsanitary

357
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
And it was all hers

358
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
And in July I went to visit her there

359
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
Yeah it took

360
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
Real well but I found he made it

361
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
Keto me how you feel

362
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
I love it

363
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,567
Is more Romeo

364
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
Small spaces

365
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,919
I can get around a whole lot better here than I could

366
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479
And I just send you a

367
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,527
Just love me when I first came in like a

368
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
And half a mile away

369
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
That very same day

370
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,951
Alright so I'm walking toward

371
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
North Bradford

372
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
Walking tour that wow look at this

373
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
Oh my God

374
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
One of the houses just

375
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,263
Came down there's a big orange excavator with a claw and it just

376
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
It just took an entire house down

377
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,151
That was number 924 that was the house where I tried the door

378
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
That was amazing

379
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,671
That was number 926 that was amazing

380
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,023
Number 926 I was the one where the owner had gone missing in Ethiopia

381
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
By the end of the day

382
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
All but

383
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
Two of the houses on the Block worth

384
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
When was Vanessa

385
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,959
This Old House number 930 where the water was

386
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Still hooked up

387
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
And then the one next door 932 that one head as best

388
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
But those two houses

389
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
Came down two weeks

390
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,687
Soap all the houses are gone now and

391
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
The plan is to turn the block

392
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
In the some kind of parkour

393
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,879
Final accounting all of the 17 houses on that block of North Bradford

394
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
Prince Street are down

395
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
Total cost about

396
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,231
$700,000

397
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
Baltimore still has

398
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,351
7500 houses that need

399
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
To be demolished

400
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,447
The rest of the country there are millions more houses

401
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
That need to be known

402
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,799
A couple weeks ago I wrote Amtrak down to DC

403
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,103
And I looked for that block of North Bradford

404
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
Like I always do

405
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,455
But I missed it it like slid right by me

406
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,527
Because I was so used to looking for the houses

407
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
And the houses aren't there anymore

408
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,191
