Support for NPR comes from investor.gov

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,096
Presenting this mess

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,632
When it comes to investing

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,912
We all have Quest

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,472
And investor.gov has answers

6
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,264
If you're free resource for

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,824
Tools tips and information about investing

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,104
Before you invest

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
Investor.gov

10
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,968
Hey everyone Sally home here

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,248
The market

12
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016
For art

13
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,808
Is really fickle

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
Something that sold for a ton of money last year

15
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,440
Might be hard to even sell it all next

16
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:35,840
And this story from way back in 2010 explains those Dynamics

17
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,864
Really well

18
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
Soap

19
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,192
We are re-airing that show today

20
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,496
We'll have an update for you at the end where we

21
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,312
Run the numbers and tell you whether or not

22
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,128
You should be putting all your money into sharks

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
Pickled in formaldehyde

24
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,712
I'll make sense later

25
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
Cure Thrift Shop

26
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,808
The show starts with a number

27
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
That number

28
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,856
Is 12 million

29
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:02,720
12 million dollars that is how much a 15 foot shark in formaldehyde

30
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
Artist Damien Hirst

31
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,560
Reportedly sold for in 2005

32
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
Title which I love is

33
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,656
The physical impossibility of death

34
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
In the mind of someone living

35
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,520
Title alone is worth $1000000 exactly

36
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,568
I have another slightly smaller number

37
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,104
1.5 million.

38
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,432
That is how much Eddie Saunders tried to sell his shark

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
Eddie Saunders own an electrical shop and he said he had a shark hanging in his shop before Hurst did his shark thing

40
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,648
And so Saunders Randa Dad saying

41
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,464
New Year sale only 1 million British pounds

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,024
5 million pounds on the Damien Hirst

43
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
Nobody bought his shark

44
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,608
That Anika by the way,

45
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,448
Trauma book I've been reading called the 12 million dollar stuffed shark about the r

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
And that

47
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
Anecdote is

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,640
Certamen capsulas what are podcasts about today why does one guy's stuff sharks sell for $12

49
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,944
And another guy basically can't even tell his stuff

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,064
Hello and welcome to the Planet Money art gallery walk around or yourself some wine in one of those

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Little plastic cups

52
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
Take a look at the art

53
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,512
After these kisses are really speaking to me David the times I enjoyed that when the Bold color the vibrant

54
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,840
Dynamism the brushstrokes

55
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,168
It's so cheap it's a bargain

56
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,776
Today we're going to try to figure out the answer to that question that no artist likes

57
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
Discuss price

58
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:26,432
That wonderful thing that you just created a tab in are you just poured your creative Soul into

59
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,712
How much is Accutane cost

60
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,064
Support for this podcast and the following message come from Delta

61
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,136
Delta flies to 300 cities around the world

62
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,976
Best 300 cities where many people do the same things you do

63
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,816
That's 300 cities were people in those 300 cities

64
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,144
Think they're the only ones who know about that one place

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
And 300 cities where people miss someone

66
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,776
One and one of Delta's other 299

67
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,128
Delta isn't flying to 300 cities merely to bring people together

68
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,456
But to show that we're not that far apart in the first place

69
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Delta

70
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
Keep climbing

71
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,624
Start with the sound I'm going to play tell me if you can

72
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,792
Identified I can barely

73
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
Hear it

74
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,144
Is an empty room

75
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
That's the sound of the winkelmann art gallery on 27th Street in

76
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,360
Big empty room White Walls

77
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
Photograph song about

78
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Feet apart or something

79
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,248
And I wanted to start the discussion here because

80
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
Justice League

81
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,136
An Ansel Adams photograph of Yosemite National Park sold

82
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,440
For $772,000

83
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
When I visited the Winkleman gallery

84
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
On the wall we're photographs

85
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
Sky Matthew Albanese

86
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,960
They look just a dramatic one was of this huge ominous tornado training across a field

87
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Another one was

88
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,800
Glacier in Antarctica another one with a

89
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Volcano

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,896
Except that Ed winkelman the guy runs the gallery said

91
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
It's not a tornado that's not Antarctica

92
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
And that's not a box

93
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,552
Evil disease models out of everyday materials

94
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
A studio set for example

95
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,672
What looks like a tornado is actually

96
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,952
Cell wall

97
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,024
What looks like an iceberg is all made out of sugar

98
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,815
What looks like the volcano

99
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
Is

100
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,935
Tile and grout that's pretty great right now

101
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Grenada

102
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,543
Foreground in Sky grass and bushes is all made of parsley

103
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
And a very convincing

104
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
Alex here like this is a

105
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,223
At the iceberg

106
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Make sugar

107
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
Oh my God

108
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,111
Exactly like an iceberg

109
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Wow

110
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,743
Apparently it's all in like the lighting he set these things up and

111
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
Working on them in the studio they like little diorama

112
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,935
Yeah it was linked to be the foot of these on her blog npr.org money

113
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
But Dave I have a

114
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,543
You have an ugly Quest I have an ugly question

115
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
How much is that going to run me

116
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,151
It's $2,480 framing

117
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
It's cheaper than Ansel Adams

118
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
And lookie probably put a lot more work into it

119
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Yeah that's true

120
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
Ansel Adams

121
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
The real stuff

122
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,463
So this guy had to make the iceberg and then take a photo

123
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
So much harder

124
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
Federal iceberg

125
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,375
So it's a hard question what should the spider graph cost

126
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
I asked

127
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
Talk about price

128
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,823
My question is harder than that it's how do you

129
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
Decide what price tag to put on

130
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
Okay

131
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,199
Sound there really is a system

132
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
System

133
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
I love it I can

134
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,063
Imagine that the artisan

135
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,463
Is a system for president

136
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,023
People you know who aren't famous yet and

137
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,863
He said that there's always awkward moment you know I'll have some new artist

138
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,399
Really really likes their work

139
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,239
And you're maybe sitting there in front of their paintings and then

140
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
You got to put a price tag on it

141
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
The formula

142
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,383
It has very little to do with how good the artist

143
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
Okay so depends on the scale

144
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Besides you mean yes

145
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
A bigger cost more

146
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Yes

147
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,879
What if it's small and super details and beautiful

148
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:23,231
What's the scale is one aspect

149
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
Scale

150
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
What I would consider intensity

151
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,167
Cuz you said if it's very small and super detailed it took a lot more time

152
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,775
So scale intensity the third criteria is what he calls medium

153
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,847
Notarized what it made of is a sculpture carved out of wood

154
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
Is it made of marble

155
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
How many copies are they

156
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,271
If it's a photograph and you have multiple editions of it's going to be less expensive

157
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,343
Oil paintings in general are known to be

158
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:54,463
Twice as expensive per square inch over the same artist drawings

159
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
Really

160
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,583
Alright so what I'm learning is if I'm in emerging artists

161
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,143
I want to do big oil paintings

162
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
And not

163
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Tiny

164
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
Charcoal drawings

165
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,031
Yeah really really really really big

166
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,383
He says at the end of the day the artist

167
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
You know you can go around the galleries in

168
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Call Center pricing

169
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
Yeah I told you that there's actually a minimum price

170
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,135
You know as a gallery owner he's got his own cost right he's got

171
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
He's got his employees

172
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,511
You got the wine that they serve at the opening

173
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
What is the cheapest

174
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
Possible painting you can buy in the

175
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,679
I know a nice neighborhood they're going to run over a thousand bucks

176
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
Have back up here it's just like

177
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
One piece of art

178
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,919
And I'm like 10 feet another piece of art you know so

179
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
Then I can meet you

180
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
All right

181
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527
That explains the prices of set of artist that are

182
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
Not well-known merging

183
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
But it doesn't answer the question

184
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
The shark question

185
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Python requests

186
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
Why

187
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,743
Does a shark in formaldehyde cut 12

188
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,815
Is it awesome

189
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
After the break

190
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
We answer the question

191
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,823
Support for this podcast and the following message come from Delta

192
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,151
Delta flies to 300 cities around the world

193
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,991
Best 300 cities where many people do the same things you do

194
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:26,367
That's 300 cities where people in those 300 cities think they're the only ones

195
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
To know about that one place

196
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,975
And 300 cities where people miss someone

197
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,791
And one of Delta's other 299c

198
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,887
Delta isn't flying to 300 cities merely to bring people to go

199
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,215
But to show that we're not that far apart in the first

200
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Delta

201
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Keep climbing

202
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,127
I took for emerging artists

203
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
Where. Really is like a commodity

204
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,735
After that you know people start buying your art

205
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,319
Different set of economic rules

206
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,439
And to talk about this I went downtown to meet with William Bell Mall he's an economist

207
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
NYU

208
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
He's 8 years old

209
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
But the writing

210
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,351
I'm in competition with Methuselah at these days

211
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
Most people

212
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
My age

213
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
Have

214
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,031
Laid down their pens

215
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
However

216
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,383
I do remember Poppin you once

217
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,943
Attended a lecture by

218
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
The notion

219
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Economist

220
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
ACP Google

221
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
And he got up and he said

222
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,903
You have to realize that

223
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,951
I am best described

224
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,511
As an ancient squid

225
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,839
Who still considered a continues

226
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,655
To eject squirts of ink

227
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
And the

228
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,287
Feel like qualify under that description

229
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Falmouth

230
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
Certainly won my heart

231
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,015
It's one of the things the economics of Art

232
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,831
An artist in South eustachy sculpture there

233
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,135
Paintings that he's done around his office

234
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,695
And occasionally actually sells window Kali for a few hundred

235
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,767
I'm almost famous on this topic for a paper he wrote

236
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Called

237
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,887
Unnatural value or art investment as floating crap game

238
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,239
We got a lot of good titles in this in the podcast

239
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,847
We have a copy of that paper here it's from 1985 and its

240
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
The scan

241
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:28,479
Of the original paper that the scan of a printout from 1985

242
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
Fun. Matrix

243
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Printer paper

244
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
Bring back memories

245
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:38,719
Underline under line under each letter is Maui

246
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
I do I get to the art invest

247
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,703
Two partners II

248
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,495
It's no mystery what determines the price

249
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
Set of art art like everything else

250
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Supply and demand

251
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
If you're famous and you got up

252
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,663
Line of people waiting to buy your neck

253
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,455
You can charge more for that

254
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,295
Or if you got some rich guy who really wants to buy a formaldehyde shark

255
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,647
Bidding against some other rich guy who also wants the shark you know the price goes up to 12 million dollars

256
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,719
He says what makes are different from a commodity like

257
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,279
Oil for ball bearings

258
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
Rice

259
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,607
I need the different from things like stocks or bonds

260
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,423
Is it with those things you can try to

261
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
Price

262
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Good luck

263
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,799
State dependent swings

264
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
Inhuman taste

265
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
I am

266
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:34,271
Absolutely convinced that there is nothing about human taste

267
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
I can be cold quotes

268
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
Rational

269
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,159
How many cups are benzos blue is better than her head

270
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
How to use

271
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
I change my mind

272
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
At this point

273
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
Art art depends

274
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
Purely on human teeth

275
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
Here's something he wrote in the paper

276
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,447
Their prices float more or less

277
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Aimlessly

278
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:59,871
What but it's not unless I mean there is I mean just like his fundamentals for stocks and bonds You could argue that are

279
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Art

280
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,455
Animals are just basically what the art

281
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,807
Critics think about that

282
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
Inside of my jogging

283
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,879
Speaking of the heart

284
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
Analysis I'm going to continue to call him now

285
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
Here's what one

286
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,303
Curator flat artemest had to say about Damien Hirst

287
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
Formaldehyde shark

288
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
Quote it's brutally honest and confer

289
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
Rotational

290
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
He draws attention to the paranoiac

291
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
Denial of death

292
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,775
That permeates our culture

293
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,823
And therefore definitely worth 12 mil

294
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
Especially if you can talk for more later

295
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
And that is

296
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
The thing you hear about a lot

297
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,527
You hear that record prices for art in the news

298
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
The cost of the telephone

299
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,391
A hundred million at Andy Warhol piece sold for 72 million dollars recently

300
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
Christie's Auction and so

301
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
You hear a lot of people talking about art

302
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
As indictment

303
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,583
All says it all the time you should buy art

304
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,191
You should buy real estate a good investment

305
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
And in fact

306
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
It's better than stocks

307
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
But he says

308
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
That's wrong

309
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,615
And I can tell you as an economist just from Theory

310
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
That should not be

311
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
So here's is a Konami

312
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
Alta can I give you a choice

313
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,551
You can buy a painting

314
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
Or you can buy a bond

315
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
And in 10 years

316
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,183
They both can agree on value and be able to sell them for the exact same mm

317
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
Which would you pay more

318
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
Well I guess

319
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Is the bond pretty

320
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,007
Is the painting pretty

321
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,567
And I can hang it on my wall you can hang on your wall

322
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,967
I guess I would pay more for the painting and the 10 years that I'm going to be keeping it before I sell it back

323
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
Right so at the end of 10 years or both can be worth

324
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
Same

325
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,111
And you just told me you're willing to pay more for the

326
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Painting right

327
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
Crappy financial and passing rate your pain

328
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,839
More than you would for the bond but you're getting the same

329
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
Borat make the banda crappy

330
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Aesthetic

331
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,471
Piped financially speaking

332
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,591
If you don't care about our am I going to put it

333
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
You're better off always here

334
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,199
Putting it in stocks and bonds

335
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Benton AR

336
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
Least in theory that should that should be true

337
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
So he wanted to test that

338
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,855
Turn that soda hard to test because

339
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,903
Need a good dataset of art sales

340
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
And that's when he found

341
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
The book

342
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
The book

343
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
Bi-Rite linger

344
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
Outrageous we have it here

345
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,887
I think it's called the economies of taste

346
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,495
The rise and fall of the picture Market 1763 19:6

347
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
60 by Gerald reitlinger

348
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
House

349
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,175
Pages and pages of

350
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
Works of art

351
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
Going back

352
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
Several centuries

353
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
That work

354
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,439
By the leading auction houses

355
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
So here

356
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191
Rembrandt house Rembrandt night so Rembrandt

357
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
The painting is old man in a black hat

358
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:12,639
Bought by Lord Scarsdale 1761 for 210 lb

359
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:18,015
1760 numbers and statistically analyzed

360
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
What we found

361
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,647
Exactly what had been

362
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
Predicted by the theory

363
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
By you

364
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Buy me

365
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,327
It turns out that art

366
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,143
Was a good investment

367
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,703
Is paid off an aesthetic

368
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,287
But in terms of dollars

369
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
You were much better off

370
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Buying stocks

371
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Awesome Bunz

372
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
Okay so stocks and bonds are better than ours

373
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
Okay what if you bought like a Monet

374
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
1920

375
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,879
Yeah I think he's talking about a portfolio of all artists

376
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:01,279
I mean a PreSonus Peace during the day

377
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
Now but if you bought

378
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:13,311
Dave Roberts Raton

379
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
300

380
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
Here's the quote that went along with that

381
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
In the Heyday of mid-victorian romantic

382
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
Kate the watercolors of David Roberts

383
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
With a delight of King

384
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
Is fussy

385
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:32,511
It's fuzzy oil paintings and Interiors of churches could make clothes on 2,000 pounds in the sales room

386
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
But

387
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,607
In 1933 that's 70 years after his death

388
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,447
One of them sold for just 10 guineas

389
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
Which is Amazon

390
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
So

391
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
Art analyst

392
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,663
Art critics curators are about as accurate in the long-term a stock analyst it sounds like

393
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,711
Who's a very good short-term

394
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
Play but not not too many want to buy it

395
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
Dave Roberts

396
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,391
Don't buy at home

397
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:05,279
Hey it's a lie again back in the present

398
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,351
William baumol died in 2017

399
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
With 95

400
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
And in the spirit bomb wallpaper

401
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:16,031
We wanted to know what would have happened if you had taken his advice

402
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
So

403
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
What would have happened if you'd invested in stocks

404
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,175
Say instead of in a collection of art

405
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
All right

406
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
If back in 2010

407
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
You had taken $10,000

408
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,879
And invested in the S&P 500 index of stocks

409
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,231
You would have over $28,000 now

410
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,303
Now that does not include management fees which

411
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
Would be small

412
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
And doesn't include taxes

413
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,983
But still it's a 180 percent return over 9 issue years

414
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
Not that

415
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
Now

416
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,639
What about if you had taken that $10,000 and put it into art

417
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,247
Artprice.com has this index of art bought and sold around the world

418
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
We got the spreadsheet

419
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
We ran the numbers and

420
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,159
Still is not an amazing

421
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Investment

422
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:10,047
According to this index of millions of sales of paintings sculptures drawings

423
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,119
Your $10,000 would likely have lost

424
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,423
Money about an 11% loss

425
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,287
And that's not even taking into account things like high sales commissions storage cost

426
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
But

427
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:28,223
Maybe you don't like having an iceberg made out of sugar sitting in the living room

428
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,015
Maybe that would have been worth it to you

429
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:35,135
We are interested in what kinds of animals

430
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,695
You think should be pickled in formaldehyde

431
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:44,095
Email us Planet Money at mpr.org we are also on Twitter Facebook and Instagram at Planet Money

433

Is at it again

434
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,823
Give a new video out about fancy vodka and whether it is worth

435
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
The money

436
00:18:54,847 --> 00:19:00,991

437
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
Planet Money shorts

438

00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,719

440
