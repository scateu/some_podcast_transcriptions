In 2008 Neel Kashkari was working in the treasury

7
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,552
Under George W bush

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,088
And he got what was

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,880
What was kind of a promotion

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,672
But a promotion into a job.

11
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,952
Sounds off

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,744
It was the middle of the financial

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,536
The crisis and Kush Curry got picked

14
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,096
To run the government bailout of the bank

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144
How old were you at the time

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,240
I was 35 at the time and how much money were you

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
In charge of

18
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:46,848
The program is maximum size with 700 billion dollars

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
Taupe Qashqai trending

20
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,688
Massive bailout of the bank

21
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,480
The country made it through the finance

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,856
And a few years later Congress passed a law that changed the way banks are ready

23
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,648
The lot is called.

24
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
Frank

25
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,488
Dodd-Frank does have some good points

26
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,536
But when you get to the big question

27
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,864
Is Dodd-Frank going to protect us from having to bail out the banks again

28
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
Unfortunately no

29
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,424
What do you think the

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,472
The backers of Dodd-Frank are

31
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,008
Basing their beliefs

32
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
Hope and prayer

33
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
You really

34
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,128
Yes

35
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,664
They don't want to do anyting

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
2

37
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,992
Fundamentally restructure the financial system

38
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,296
And instead they will hope and pray

39
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,832
The next time will be different

40
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,880
So last month

41
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,928
Kashkari came out with his own plan

42
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,744
A plan he says cuz more to address the

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
The too-big-to-fail problem

44
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,560
Can anything we've done

45
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
So far

46
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,888
And he says the initial response has been promising

47
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
I was pleased that

48
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,448
Bernie Sanders came out

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,752
And supported us strongly with our process

50
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:51,360
A weave in the Wall Street Journal editorial page put a very nice editorial on our plan

51
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,944
If we can unite Bernie Sanders in the Wall Street Journal editorial page

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,992
I think we're on intellectually Solid Ground

53
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
Hello and welcome to Planet Money

54
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
I'm Jacob Goldstein Republicans have said for years that they want to change the way Banks or

55
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,096
Regulated and next year they're going to get their chance to do something

56
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,216
So on Today Show we talked about a big idea for how to change the rules for banks

57
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,288
It comes from the man who ran the last big bailout

58
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,152
And he says his proposed rules would make another big bailout much less likely

59
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,136
Before he went to Washington

60
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,928
Neel Kashkari worked at Goldman

61
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,280
And his worldview at the time was what you might expect from a young Goldman

62
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,120
Coming into treasury I consider myself to be a free market ideologue

63
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
I believe in markets I believe that

64
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,240
If you take a risk you get the benefits and you bear the Conte

65
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
Defenses

66
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
I assumed it

67
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,616
Successful people were successful because they were you know

68
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
More clever

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,224
So when you're bailing out the banks with hundreds of billions of dollars of

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
Taxpayer money

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,808
Are you thinking about that all men are you sort of

72
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,112
Icing reviews

73
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,720
Not in the moment in the moment all we were thinking about was how do we prevent

74
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,000
The Great Depression

75
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Yeah

76
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,816
So cash car is trying to prevent the Great

77
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,376
And he becomes the face of the bailout

78
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
Of this program called tarp

79
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:23,520
Hino represents 700 billion taxpayer dollars given to Banks

80
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,592
At a moment when taxpayers are losing their houses

81
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
Getting fired from their jobs

82
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:33,248
Probably the toughest moment for me was when I had to go testify in front of Congress mr. catch Gary

83
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
We told you in there

84
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,368
That we wanted treasure to safeguard the tarp Money

85
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,208
From waste and abuse my longest hearing was almost six hours

86
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
I tell you mister cash carry

87
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,096
40 angry members of Congress both parties

88
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,424
Basically yelling at me the people that don't have saving

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,032
Are bailing out the very wealthiest in this country there's something inherently

90
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
We Wrong

91
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
In this picture

92
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
I felt like

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,664
Hey wait a second I am one of the people here

94
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
That's China

95
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
Stabilize the situation in and we need your help

96
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
And so it was very tough for me in the moment

97
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,672
By the spring of 2009 koshkar had given out the bailout money

98
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
Keep thinking that beating from Congress

99
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,768
And the country was still in bad shape

100
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,327
But by that point we had avoided another great

101
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,399
Kokkari decided to leave the treasury Department

102
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,703
And get as far away from Washington

103
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
I just needed to detox

104
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,799
My three years in Washington were grueling

105
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,895
I just wanted to get away from it as far as possible until I basically

106
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
Moved into the woods

107
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,991
Just work with my hands do something real something

108
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Physical

109
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,831
To remove myself from Washington as far as I could

110
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
He lived outside Lake Tahoe

111
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
Denise big beautiful mountains

112
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
Got a couple dogs

113
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
Get off the shed

114
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
And now he did have time to rehearse

115
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
One of the things

116
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,351
I like to do when I was in the woods was chop wood

117
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:57,215
It was a great stress reliever and so trust me when I was sitting there chopping wood I was reliving

118
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
Some of my moments taking my beatings on Capitol Hill

119
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,103
And so part of the time was just reflecting on

120
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
Understanding their anger

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,503
Understanding you know could I have done something different could have done something better

122
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,295
But at the end of the day

123
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,647
What I realized when you violate the core beliefs of a society

124
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
It leads to great anger in that Society

125
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:23,071
And so as a society we have a core belief that's been passed down from generation to generation

126
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
In free market

127
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,167
If you take a rescue get the upside

128
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
You get the downside

129
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,031
But we violated that fundamentally when we bailed out the banks

130
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
Customer left the woods after a battle

131
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,407
He went back to work in finance for a few years

132
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,967
Then he ran for governor of California

133
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
As Republic

134
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
I came in second

135
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,319
There's no prize for coming up in an election

136
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,647
Not long after that he got a call from the Federal Reserve Bank

137
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
A Mini Apple

138
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
The Minneapolis fed

139
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
They were looking for someone to be their new present

140
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
He got the job started at the beginning of 2000

141
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,607
As part of the job

142
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,911
He's one of the dozen or so people who decide

143
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
What interest rates are going to be for the whole country

144
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,799
He's also in charge of about a thousand people who work at the

145
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
And a big part of his job is

146
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
Traveling around the Upper Midwest

147
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,431
Talking to people listening to them

148
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
And if he's doing this

149
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,527
People are telling him those bank bailouts that he led

150
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,647
They are still a big deal today people are still very upset about the bailouts

151
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
Here we are 8 years later

152
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
And I think a lot of the

153
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,815
Anger in the polarization that we see in the country today

154
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:32,191
Is directly tied back to the financial crisis and the feeling that a lot of people say hey this was not fair

155
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
Cuz, looks at Dodd-Frank

156
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,543
The law Congress passed in 2010

157
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
To fix the finance

158
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,895
If this sprawling complex law has all these different

159
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,967
Choices there are some useful parts

160
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
The Dodd-Frank

161
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,063
But overall he says it is not going to solve the bailout

162
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
Dodd-Frank has a lot of moving pieces

163
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Is that

164
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
In theory if they all moved

165
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,767
Like an orchestra in perfect coordination

166
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Perhaps it'll work

167
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,375
Having lived in the Frontline of a crisis

168
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
That's not how it really happened

169
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,239
As an example cuz Curry points to this document

170
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
What's that are required under Dodd-Frank

171
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
They're called

172
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Living will

173
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
Yadira is

174
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,967
The force Banks to come up with a detailed plan for how they could be broken up if they got into

175
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
The trouble they're sort of like a user's manual

176
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
For breaking up a big bang

177
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,111
Well these living will these guides

178
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
Are some ten thousand pages long

179
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,255
Remember just for one bank for One Bank

180
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
Go back to China

181
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
This this

182
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:38,239
Decisions about is this Bank going to live or die would literally happen over the course of a weekend or people get like

183
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,799
What is a 10000 page book going to do for you and that's

184
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Nothing

185
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,271
I need a philosophy class or an illegal class

186
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,575
And I'm sure it's a very interesting intellectual extra

187
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
In the middle of a crisis

188
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
From what I can tell it's totally useless

189
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,999
SoCal car thinks that Dodd-Frank with its

190
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,815
10000 page users manual for breaking up Banks

191
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,887
He thinks that is not going to end the bailout

192
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:11,007
And he decides his first big project with the Minneapolis fed will be

193
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,567
To come up with a plan to solve that problem

194
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
To finally make the banks

195
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Crash proof

196
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
Guinness team they start having all these public meetings

197
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
They bring in Ben Bernanke

198
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
Professors Wall Street types

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,087
Some of those people said break up the banks

200
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,183
Some said don't do anything. Frank is just fine this is the right solution

201
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,535
And we wanted to learn from everybody that the only people who refuse to participate

202
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,071
Where the big bang stem cell

203
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,143
We didn't let that stop you invited

204
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
We're invited them every time

205
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,007
Basically through back channels told us

206
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
If we participate

207
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,871
We're going to be acknowledging that the too-big-to-fail problem still exist

208
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
So we're not going to participate

209
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
Really

210
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Yes

211
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
Say more about

212
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
They want to pretend that the problem has been solved

213
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
Date the big Banks

214
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Wanted

215
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:06,559
Pretend that they paid their debt back to society that they're more regulated now

216
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,119
They should be left alone and there's no more rest

217
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
And that medicine

218
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Daughtry

219
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,007
Part of it is true they have paid back the literal death

220
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
The are more regulated now

221
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,103
But they're still too big.

222
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
And one of the things that came out

223
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
There was

224
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,247
Not you not unanimous consensus but there was wide content

225
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:30,623
All the experts Arcana Minneapolis Ted of one of those big Banks ran into trouble today

226
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
They would still get bailed out

227
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,463
They are still too big to fail

228
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,047
Now I'm just going to leave cuz try for just like a minute here

229
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
To talk about

230
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
About what that mean

231
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
You know like

232
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,215
Why don't people talk about other big companies like Google or Johnson & Johnson

233
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
Beer tube

234
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Why is this just about

235
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,591
Any answer in a word

236
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
You deaf

237
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,687
You know we think of banks as lending out money

238
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:59,295
But thanks also borrow money they borrow tons and tons of money

239
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,647
They borrow from Ordinary People from businesses they borrow from other Banks

240
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,207
And when a bank gets into financial trouble

241
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,279
It can't pay back all that money that is borrowed

242
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,887
That is a problem for everybody who loaned that money to the trouble Bank

243
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,959
You know those people those businesses those Banks

244
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
Don't get their money back

245
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
So they can't pay their debt

246
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
In the case of a really big bang

247
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
Distance of Lake a lake

248
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,175
Chain reaction that goes through the entire

249
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
Give me a simple definition of too big

250
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,319
A simple definition of if a bank

251
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Deutsche bank

252
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,159
Pepsi it could lead to a recession

253
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,975
It could have spillovers on the Main Street

254
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
Not simply onto

255
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
The customers of that

256
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,143
Soap cuz Curry solution to the too-big-to-fail problem is

257
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,727
Don't let the banks use so much borrowed money

258
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,287
Force them to rely Less on debt

259
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,847
Sports Infuse more of their own money

260
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
Money they haven't borrowed

261
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Don't have to

262
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,967
That way if a bank gets into Financial

263
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,783
Will trouble you can take the losses out of its own money

264
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,599
And still have enough to pay back the people it borrowed

265
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,671
We decide the banks need much

266
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
Tire buffer

267
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
So that if they make mistakes

268
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,327
They have enough buffer to absorb those losses

269
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,655
If you go back to before the crisis and look at all the money

270
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,215
Thanks we're blending out or were using to invest

271
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,055
97% of that money with money they had borrow

272
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,359
Only 3% with their own money

273
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
Only 3% with their capital

274
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
It's the way you say that in the jar

275
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Today

276
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
Banks are using more of their own money

277
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
It's about

278
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
7 /

279
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Of the money

280
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,135
Kokkari says for the biggest banks

281
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,183
That number should be twice as high

282
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
Out of our plan

283
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,791
The rough measure is 15%

284
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,375
Will have to come out of their own money their Capital as we call it

285
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,215
The rest the other 85% the bank will still be able to borrow

286
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
There are other details in Kush cosplay

287
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:01,151
Banks that are still being too big to fail with see their Capital requirements go up even more update

288
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
Afterlife and more on their own money

289
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,015
They're also new rules for big finance companies that are not thanks

290
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
But forcing Banks use more of their own money

291
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,367
Increasing Capital requirements

292
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
15%

293
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,183
That is the essential first

294
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
And it sounds so simple

295
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Eating sounds kind of like

296
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
Small or trivial

297
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
Buttkicker says it would make

298
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
A huge difference

299
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
If you go back

300
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
2

301
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
2008

302
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
And imagine

303
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
The banks

304
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
You know how to infect

305
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
Made all these dumb Investments

306
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
But you don't give it out all these subprime mortgages

307
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,319
But instead of doing it with 3% Capital done it with 15%

308
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,367
How would the world have been different

309
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,439
Even if there was a bubble and it still popped

310
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
The banks would have been able to withstand it

311
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,815
They would not have had these massive failures

312
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,399
We would not have had to go to Congress to ask for a taxpayer bailout

313
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
And as a result

314
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
The recession we had

315
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
Would have been much much Milder

316
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,079
We had the deepest recession since the Great Depression

317
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
We would have had a normal recession

318
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
If this planet been in place

319
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,319
And just that's just they could still borrow 85% of the money they're lending at that just 15% would have salt all

320
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Yes

321
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
So that is his plan

322
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
Now there's one last

323
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
Course

324
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Which is

325
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:27,167
Is this going to happen in the world you know we know that Donald Trump and republicans in Congress have said they want to change the row

326
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Rules for banks

327
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,751
What are the chances bill without something like cash cars

328
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:37,407
I think elements of it absolutely have a good chance I'm not talk to people on both sides of the aisle senators and representatives

329
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,735
Who are strongly in favor of something in this direction

330
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,807
In particular this idea of higher Capital requirements

331
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,903
Pretty popular with people who tend to be into free market

332
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
Pretend to be wary of a lot of kinds of Regulation

333
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
This is for a few reasons

334
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
For one thing

335
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:59,935
People recognize that banks are not operating in the free market now you know big banks have the implicit back

336
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Also

337
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
Capital rules are relatively simple

338
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,127
You know they don't realize that much on the wisdom and discretion of regulator

339
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,455
And that appeals to people who are skeptical of regulators

340
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
There is one group

341
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
But pretty clearly does not like

342
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
RushCard

343
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Big Bank

344
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:23,231
For this story I reached out to the two trade groups that represent the biggest banks in the country

345
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
Neither one of them got back to me

346
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
But when cashcars plan was released

347
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
A spokeswoman for one of the group

348
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
It's called the financial services

349
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Sephora

350
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Put up this

351
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,311
For those looking to accelerate economic growth and job creation

352
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
Tripling Bank capital

353
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
Already doubled from pre Christ

354
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,967
Will make it much harder to meet those goals

355
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,295
Packers playing what would hurt economic growth

356
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
Enter shikari

357
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
More or less agree

358
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Will safety isn't free

359
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,207
If we raise Capital requirements

360
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Make the banks

361
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,791
Find themselves with their own money instead of borrowed money

362
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
There will be an economic cost

363
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
Specifically

364
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,959
His rules would make it more expensive for ordinary people in

365
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
