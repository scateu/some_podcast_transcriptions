Venn diagram of

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,192
Iconic

6
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,984
Pop culture moments

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,312
And critically important economic history lessons

8
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,104
There is an overlap of

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,384
Roughly 40 sec

10
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,480
So first I guess I want to ask you do you do you know this

11
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,552
Scene from Ferris Bueller course

12
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,856
Doug Irwin Economist at Dartmouth

13
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,440
Can you do it without looking like you know it by heart I can do the first part

14
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,536
In 1930 the republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the

15
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,304
Everyone

16
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,584
Anyone

17
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,376
The Tariff bill

18
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,656
The Hollies

19
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,424
Smoot

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,216
Terrorist act which

21
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,032
Anyone raised or lowered

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,568
Raised

23
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
Paris

24
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,920
In an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government

25
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
Did it work

26
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
Anyone

27
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
Anyone know the effects

28
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:58,880
Anyone anyone know it did not work out well and the economy sank further into the Great Depression

29
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,208
Not bad almost word-for-word and by the way

30
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,768
Hawley-smoot smoot-hawley Duggar when says you can't

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,816
Either way and it went when it comes to

32
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,096
Smoot-hawley you are kind of like

33
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
The smoot-hawley

34
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
Guy

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
About right

36
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
There aren't many competitors like one way of putting it I mean I think everyone knows of them but no one is

37
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,104
Stun the Deep dive like I have I guess

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,408
Doug read a book about the smoot-hawley Tariff

39
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:26,784
Including an explanation of how it became the most infamously boring High School lesson in movie history

40
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,392
They passed the actor Ben Stein who's the son of a famous economist herb Stein

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,512
They want him to be a boring High School teacher but they didn't actually script what he's going to say

42
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
So they let him rip

43
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,888
I start talking about the smoot-hawley Tariff but why do you think it works as a punchline in that

44
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,448
April 1st was delivery mainly

45
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,752
Because I think you can make smoot-hawley excited

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,848
It's spring this conflagration the Great Depression

47
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:56,224
It's has a lot of drama has really funny name Smoot and Hawley interesting characters

48
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,320
Unintended consequences and I guess now it has a tremendous amount

49
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
The relevance to today

50
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,672
Yes hello and welcome

51
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,232
Planet Money I'm Kenny Malone and I'm finally home

52
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,120
And we all get passed on through the holidays because the story of the worst

53
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
Terrorist ever

54
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,752
Eerie parallels to what's happening in the white house right now

55
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
Today on the show

56
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,336
How this big old tariff bill with

57
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
With a silly name

58
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,152
Help tank the world economy

59
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,224
And why it means that today 90 years later

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,528
President Donald J Trump has the power

61
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
To start

62
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
What a lot of people fear

63
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Is a trade

Quick recap of where we are in the world of import

70
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Tariffs

71
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,504
About a month ago President Trump walked up to a Podium and

72
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
Follow through on a big

73
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Campaign

74
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
Promise

75
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,672
We will have a 25% tariff on foreign Steel

76
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,000
And a 10% tariff on foreign aluminum

77
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,816
He also put some tariffs on washing machines and

78
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
Solar panels

79
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,888
Details of these tariffs are changing

80
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
Pretty much every day some countries

81
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
Exemptions or maybe more products tax

82
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
Broad Strokes

83
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,872
This is a political move by the Trump Administration in part 2

84
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
Punish China for

85
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,224
What they say is a dirty tactics

86
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
Send the trade world

87
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,320
And it's also partly a protectionist

88
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,416
Tax to help people who are a big part of President Trump's building block

89
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,512
AKA manufacturing sectors left behind by globalization

90
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
Economist

91
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
Tend to not agree

92
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,120
On March but you would be hard-pressed to find one who

93
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
Who thinks these tariffs are good

94
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
And a big reason for that is

95
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,264
This kind of economics

96
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Horse

97
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,872
Story scare young Economist around the campfire

98
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
The tale

99
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Absolute

100
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
Holly we are thinking

101
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
The best place to start

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
Probably with the

103
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
Election in 1920

104
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
That's the perfect place to start again

105
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Tuckerman

106
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,208
So in 1928 the US economy was doing

107
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
Exceptionally well

108
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:21,631
The stock market was booming and players were hiring the unemployment rate was very low there's no Great Depression

109
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Play whatsoever

110
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,471
And so one question is what could the parties fight about

111
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
In that campaign

112
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
Try to win voters

113
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
And I

114
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,919
Turns out while the overall economy is doing well there's one second it was being left behind

115
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
And was not doing well and that was a Greek

116
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
Farmers were feeling forgotten

117
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Desperate

118
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Because

119
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
They're losing their

120
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Jobs

121
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,951
The economy is Shifting away from them and towards a

122
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
Fancy newfangled tacky

123
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Industry

124
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
The coastal Elites

125
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
In this case back then the hot

126
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,143
Tacky industry is

127
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,471
Manufacturing making things

128
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Like

129
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Cars

130
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Sewing machine

131
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,847
So this became an election issue

132
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
Save the farmer

133
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,919
Save the people who are being left

134
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
And

135
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
The Republicans and their president

136
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
Super they win the election

137
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
Herbert Hoover president of the United States

138
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Stood before the people

139
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,487
His platform had been prosperity for everyone

140
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
By the time Hoover was giving his inaugural address

141
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
Republicans

142
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,887
In Congress were already trying to make good on this

143
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
Protect the farmers promise

144
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Most notably

145
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Reed Smoot

146
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,799
And Willis hawley describe these men for Alyssa

147
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,127
So one of them sort of tall and lean

148
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
That would be

149
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Reed Smoot

150
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,039
And the others little shorter little squatter little fatter in that would be Willis Holly

151
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
You know the Muppets

152
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
Yes

153
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
You know Statler and Waldorf

154
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,487
They're my favorite Muppets yes they're the guys the old guys in the balcony who are

155
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
Jeering at the act on stage

156
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,863
No they can improve all Chauvet just change the ending

157
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
What are closer to the beginning

158
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Who's the one more

159
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,335
I want them giving us something other than second-rate entertainment

160
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
What's up

161
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,175
Third grade entertainment

162
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,015
Person is you

163
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,391
Reed Smoot was a senator from Utah Willett Ali was a wreck

164
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
The different Oregon

165
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,511
They were the heads of the Committees in the Senate and a house that were in charge of tariffs at the

166
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
That's why their names are on the bill

167
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
The two agricultural products that were facing

168
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
The most

169
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,959
Foreign competition at that time were wool

170
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
And sugar

171
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
Tok so you can imagine one version of

172
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
That's where the pilot

173
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
Just say sugar and

174
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,663
Okay let's just put a tariff on imported sugar

175
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
And wool

176
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,967
And then we know we could debate

177
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
The benefits of that

178
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,807
But that is not even have a debate when

179
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
At all

180
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,623
Partly because of something called

181
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
Logrolling

182
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Which is basically

183
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Vote Trading

184
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
So

185
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
Say you're a representative from

186
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
Corn

187
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
State like Iowa

188
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
Wait

189
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,911
Why would I go for your sugar and wool tariff

190
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,239
I am not supporting that unless you put a tariff on

191
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,799
Horn button the Representative for Ohio

192
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Would be like wait

193
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,151
Why am I going to vote for your sugar and will end

194
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
Corn Terrace

195
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
If you don't protect

196
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
My goldfish producers

197
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
And everyone's like

198
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
Goldfish producer

199
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,671
Apparently there was someone firm in Ohio that raise goldfish

200
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,999
And they thought that imported goldfish were eating into their mark

201
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,815
Talking like a little goldfish in a bag and a

202
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Fair

203
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,143
Bicycle Tour talking about

204
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
Like orange goldfish

205
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
For your

206
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Fathead

207
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
Like a goldfish

208
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
Did they get a tariff 35%

209
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,919
Industry after industry with lining up asking for a tear

210
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
Asking for

211
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
Protection

212
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
The congressmen were over

213
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
They worked day and night

214
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,111
A lot of complaints of members of Congress saying how

215
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,159
It'll stay up so late listening to

216
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
People droning on about

217
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,767
Clothespins and oil drums

218
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
Certain types of chemicals

219
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:08,447
New York State grain and hay Dealers Association they made the Polly on behalf of the humble buckwheat industry

220
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
And just to be clear

221
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,543
Humble back with a quote from what actually happened then

222
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,407
I think that buckwheat Dennis Cruz portray itself as humble so they say we are the humble

223
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
We dentist

224
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,015
There were so many Industries asking for protection that

225
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,063
The Senate heard from more than one

226
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,855
Thousand Witnesses

227
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
Who gave more than

228
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,207
8000 pages of pasta

229
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
And it's worth noting

230
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
Unlike sugar and wool a lot of

231
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
These industries

232
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Barely had any for in combat

233
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,447
It's unclear that the Tariff would even help

234
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,007
Once the flood gates were open

235
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
Be humble buckwheat Growers the

236
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
Close Pin makers

237
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
The goldfish

238
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
Growers I guess

239
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
They were like

240
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Come on

241
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Why not us too

242
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
Yeah why can't we get a little bit

243
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
Right and so instead of

244
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
This being a

245
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Terrifying

246
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
Sugar and wolin baby

247
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,975
One or two other agricultural industry

248
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
The ultimate number of tariffs

249
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
Was

250
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
How many

251
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,399
I think over 800

252
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Cooperate

253
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
100 right

254
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
Of course Congress has passed

255
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,079
Carrots before or since the beginning of the country

256
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,687
But this particular group of congressmen seems to be going pretty

257
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
Tariff

258
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Crazy

259
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,783
There is one group watching from the sidelines

260
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Thinking

261
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
What are you

262
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
The Economist

263
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
When politicians are talking about terrorist

264
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
Economist get very

265
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
Exasperated

266
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
Because tariffs

267
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,423
It might seem like they're solving one problem

268
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,983
But they can cause a million other problem

269
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,055
That is true even for the people that are supposed to

270
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
I think we want to sort of

271
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
Help people understand like why this

272
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:59,295
Was going to potentially backfire imagine Sally is a wolf armor from from then so

273
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,855
Sepia what are we

274
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,671
Wool producer sheep from Shepherd she's a shepherd

275
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,023
So she raised the Tariff on wall that's definitely going to help

276
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
Sheep farmers and wool producers

277
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
They definitely want that that's why they were fighting for it

278
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,703
But also raises the cost of all the manufacturers of Woolen Goods

279
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,543
Trying to reduce coats in in pants and others for consumers

280
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,847
This is known as a downstream

281
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Until that is one

282
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
Problem a tariff

283
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
On wall may help

284
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Sally the shape

285
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,039
But it has these unintended ripple effect for other

286
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,879
And smoot-hawley was not just a tax on wool so

287
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,743
Now whatever benefits Ali the shepherd's getting there probably cancelled out by the fact

288
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,047
The tons of other things you need

289
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Games to buy

290
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
Those are going to cost more because Sally

291
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
Can't get these things at the global competitive

292
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:53,055
And another thing Economist hate about Terrace is that they can cause chain reactions

293
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
Around the globe

294
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
Like

295
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:00,479
You can't just put a tariff on something and expect other countries to sit back and let that happen

296
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,271
There will be counter Terrace

297
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
And this is yet another on antenna

298
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Consequences

299
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
The lawmakers

300
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,183
Apparently had not thought through back in 1930

301
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
They didn't answer

302
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
State that they would be retaliation

303
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,583
I mean that's so crazy like why not why would they not see that coming

304
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,983
Well because this was considered domestic legislation pure and simple and there'd be no foreign ramifications and that was the way it was

305
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
You thought about it

306
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
What time so there's this really a few of the reasons that

307
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,151
Economist were screaming into their pillows about the smoot-hawley bill

308
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
And before the bill made of

309
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
Is the President's Day

310
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
The Economist

311
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Tried

312
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
To explain all this

313
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
One more Thai

314
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Very

315
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
Clearly

316
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,207
A group of more than a thousand Economist got together a thousand economy

317
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
Adjust for inflation that is like

318
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
5

319
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:50,911
Thousand Economist by today's economy. Easily 5002 days Economist and they wrote and signed a letter

320
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
Begging President Hoover or Congress to

321
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,775
Stop this smoot-hawley nonsense

322
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
We have a copy of that letter right here

323
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,175
It outlines all of the ways these tariffs will be a disaster for

324
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
For the Economy Inn

325
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:08,575
Beautiful passionate meticulously detailed language that would

326
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,207
Hoover the politicians they were like

327
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Nah

328
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,559
These Ivory Tower Elites they've never worked a day in their lives

329
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
Hoover sign the tariffs into law

330
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,959
And virtually everything The Economist warned would go wrong

331
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Went wrong

332
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,775
One of the most insane

333
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
Examples is

334
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
X

335
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
American egg producers

336
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,967
Theoretically got the benefit of one of the many smoot-hawley tariff

337
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,807
The terrifying eggs went from $0.08 to $0.10 a dozen

338
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
But Canada

339
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,927
They were so incensed they raised their Terror from $0.03 to $10

340
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Whoa

341
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,511
So that was reciprocity they want the same Turf as we did

342
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,095
And here is the beautiful boneheaded Twist of smooth

343
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
American egg producers

344
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
We're exporting a

345
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,495
They were making a ton of money by sending their eggs

346
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
Canada

347
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
Or at least they were

348
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Before Smooth

349
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,687
Or exports fell from almost a million doesn't the 13000 dozen eggs

350
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,271
Are the same. So our exports of eggs really got wack

351
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
We lost a lot of dozens

352
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,647
And Canada was not the only country that got pissed off at Smoot

353
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
And Holly and

354
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,743
This kicked off an unprecedented wave

355
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Protectionism

356
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Acrostic

357
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,351
Protectionism aimed specifically at the United

358
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,935
There were a bunch more counter terrorist countries formed

359
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
Trade blocks against the US

360
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
Global trade fell by

361
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
20

362
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
6% in the years after this

363
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Because of Smoot Hawley

364
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
And the protectionism that followed it

365
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
But also because of a little thing

366
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Called

367
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
The Great

368
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
Holly was in the works

369
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
Before the Great Depression but it didn't pass until things

370
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
Had already started to go south

371
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,791
It so probably the nicest thing anyone says about smoot-hawley

372
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
Well

373
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
He didn't

374
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
Cause the Great Depression

375
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,239
Economist generally agree you know a lot of things cause of

376
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
Great Depression monetary policy Etc

377
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
But then the passage of smoot-hawley

378
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
It sure as hell

379
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
Did not have

380
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
We've tried nothing some metaphors off Doug Irwin

381
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
So

382
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
The Great Depression caused

383
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,087
The US economy

384
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
Basically

385
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,671
Flail in the water drowning

386
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,255
And the passing of smoot-hawley was the equivalent of sort of

387
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Throwing it a brick

388
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,607
Or align with nothing attached to the other end

389
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,679
That's like words

390
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,263
Cuz it and you're giving people hope but then you start pulling on it there's nothing there

391
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
And how did smoot-hawley work out for

392
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
The politicians involved

393
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Anyone

394
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Anyone that workout

395
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Anyone

396
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,039
It turns out both Holly and Smith were kicked out of Congress by their constituents ultimately

397
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
Play so it didn't work out for them

398
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
It took decades to truly undo the damage from

399
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
Smoot-hawley II

400
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
Untangle the tariffs

401
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Panda counter-terrorist

402
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Counter counter tariffs

403
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Foley

404
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
We did

405
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,887
The world moved away from protectionism

406
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Towards free trade

407
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,495
Agreements were made the World Trade Organization was set up as a kind of

408
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,823
Referee and then four years you could shut down

409
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
Conversation about terrorists by just saying

410
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Raleigh

411
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
In fact in the 1990s

412
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
Al Gore was debating Ross Perot

413
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,575
Perot was against the North American Free Trade Agreement

414
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,927
Gore brought a photograph of Smoot and Hawley

415
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,511
Scotus last time

416
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,839
So you can put it on your wall if you want to thank you thank you

417
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,935
That is the sound of Ross Perot cut up

418
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,239
Slamming this photo face down.

419
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,311
And that's because smoot-hawley had become shorthand for

420
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
Remember the last time we tried this

421
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Protectionism

422
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
Is a bad idea

423
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
Of course

424
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
Things have changed

425
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
We have

426
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,599

427
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Industrious

428
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
After the break

429
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
Holly

430
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Interim

431
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
Attorney that lost

432

440
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,183
So couple of things you may have noticed about

441
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Today's tariffs

442
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Haitian for one

443
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
Where is Congress in all of this

444
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:40,447
There were no hearings there was no vote there was no goldfish hopping no it appears as though the president was able to

445
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
Just Terrace

446
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
Yeah he kind of was

447
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,591
A huge difference between the smoot-hawley days and the Trump days

448
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Is that

449
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,687
The president now has a lot more power to set tariffs

450
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,343
And you don't Trump did actually have to follow a process here he had to come up with justification in in the case of the steel and

451
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:03,743
Aluminum tariffs it was National Security to jump through some other Hoops as well but clearly he was able to

452
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Get the Terrace done

453
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
And

454
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
This fact

455
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,607
The fact that the president Canal of uterus

456
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
Doug Irwin says

457
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,959
That is part of the legacy of Smoot Hawley

458
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:17,823
Yeah after congress went tarriff crazy in 1930 they basically said

459
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
Maybe we should have our tear

460
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Privileges

461
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,527
Congress delegated powers to the president to oversee the whole tariff system

462
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
So essentially congress-led look we made a mess of it just didn't work out so well they were like a bunch of children who'd been let loose in a

463
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
Candy store

464
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,047
And realize they couldn't be trusted to moderate their own intake

465
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,607
They overate they got sick and they said

466
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,447
They need some restraint on themselves from doing that again so they just

467
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
Delegate to another party

468
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,615
Overtime they delegated that power to the executive branch and the president

469
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,919
They decided that is the better sister

470
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
Inarguably we are now watching that better

471
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
When Congress dealt with terrorists

472
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
The game was stacked

473
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
Against narrow

474
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:08,511
You want to protect only wool and sugar well good luck buddy because it's snowballs

475
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,071
Today President Trump wants to

476
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:15,679
To protect steel and aluminum you can stop there if you wanted to

477
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
He doesn't have to trade votes to get it pass

478
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
And so we're not

479
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
Hundreds of

480
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,615
Terrace like in the days of smoot-hawley and separating these very targeted

481
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
Very political terrorists

482
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
It could be that way

483
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
But these terrorists

484
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,319
Still have Economist like screaming into their pillows again

485
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,367
Because even narrow Terrace

486
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,415
Are going to cause the same web

487
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Problems

488
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
Downstream effects

489
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,511
Ultimately shooting ourselves in the foot

490
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,303
We asked Doug Irwin

491
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Like

492
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,887
Do you think in 20 years someone is going to write

493
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
A movie scene about a boring High School

494
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
Teacher

495
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
Teaching the lessons of the Trump

496
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Tariffs and he was like

497
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
Who knows probably not

498
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
But

499
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,383
If they do make Ferris Bueller 2

500
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
Doug Irwin

501
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Will be ready

502
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:05,087
Do you want to give a shot at doing the benstein thing but with the news of the day with the Trump news I could give it a shot

503
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Okay

504
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,719
In 2018 the Republican administration of

505
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,999
Donald J Trump

506
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:17,119
It stood higher tariffs on anyone anyone steel and aluminum

507
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,679
An effort to protect the jobs of steelworkers

508
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
Did it work

509
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
Anyone anyone it did not work and we lost jobs and downstream user Industries and it failed to revitalize the steel

510
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
That is so off the top of your head well done

511
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:40,671
Today Show was produced by Lena Richards and edited by Brian Hurst

512
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,231

Stay the same for so long

516
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
And it's hilarious it is

517
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
