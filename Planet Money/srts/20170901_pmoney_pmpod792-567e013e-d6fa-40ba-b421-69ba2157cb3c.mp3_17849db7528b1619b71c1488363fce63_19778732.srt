In neighborhoods

Here to help life

11
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,640
Go right

12
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,712
Some people are just

13
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,992
Bourne wrestler

14
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,040
Amanda lindhout is like that

15
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,344
She's from a small city in Canada

16
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,744
And when she was little her favorite thing to do was sit in her bed and flip through a pile of National Geographic

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
Magazines

18
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:37,376
And I used to look at the pictures on those pages and and just lose myself

19
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,448
When she was 19 Amanda started backpacking

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,520
To the most extreme places she could find

21
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:46,848
This of course drove her mother absolutely nuts

22
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,896
Like it just one time Amanda went to pack

23
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,712
She was like you're being so reckless

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,808
You know what I had an amazing time in Pakistan and I think I

25
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
Probably

26
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,160
Rubbed it in a little bit when I came back from that trip like

27
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,768
Pakistan was the best place I ever went Mom C

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,072
In her early twenties Amanda jump

29
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:12,448
Do stuff like that she got a little freelance assignments for her local newspaper the Red Deer

30
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,752
The cat and she went to more and more dangerous places

31
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,288
Iraq Afghanistan

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,128
And then in August of 2008 Amanda got a freelancer

33
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,664
Assignment in Somalia

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,712
She was going to do a story from a refugee

35
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,272
Somalia in 08 was what policy

36
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
People call a

37
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,832
A failed State there was no sense

38
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
Government

39
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,160
Different neighborhoods were controlled by warrant

40
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
Clans

41
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,464
It was basically a war zone

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,304
Until the first couple days she's stuck in the area around her hotel in Mogadishu

43
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
What about 3 days in

44
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
Local guide gives you the okay

45
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,680
You know the roads were clear

46
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:50,080
And it was a good day to travel so she in a photographer and a translator and some local guides they all pile

47
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,616
Island to a big white SUV

48
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,640
And they head out

49
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
And for a while there's nothing

50
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
Just roads

51
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
Scrub trees dust

52
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,552
She still remembers the music she was listening

53
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:06,208
Like old music from my teenage years I was listening to Ace of Base and then she feels the s

54
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,488
SUV slow down

55
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,840
And she looks to the left and there's a car pulled over on the side of the road

56
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
In about a dozen men

57
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
Rush out from behind

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,496
And they ran out across the road

59
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
Pointing AK-47 that are vehicle

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
All of their faces were completely wrapped in checkered scarves with only their eyes showing through they pull

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
Call Amanda out of the SUV

62
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
They put a gun to her head

63
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:36,160
They searched the car and they tell her get back in the SUV and they drive

64
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,720
For I'd say about 45 minutes just

65
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
Straight through the desert

66
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,048
To a little maze of a village

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,376
They take her to a 10 building and they throw into a dark

68
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
And a while later

69
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,704
Tall skinny man walks into the room

70
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
He's wearing an orange Polo shirt

71
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
He's got Ben Franklin glasses

72
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
And he says

73
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
I'm Adam

74
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616
And then he says where you from

75
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
And she says Canada

76
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,456
And that is when he said

77
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,296
Allah has put it in my heart to ask

78
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
For a ransom

79
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
What do you think

80
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
And I

81
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
Started crying

82
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
And I said to him

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,352
My family is poor

84
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,424
And Amanda tells him something else that she is known for a long time

85
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
My government is not going to pay for me

86
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,544
The government is not going to pay Ransom

87
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,408
Canada in the US have what's called a no concessions policy on paying rent

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
Especially Tutera group

89
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
We don't negotiate

90
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,064
The Canadian and US governments will not pay

91
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
So what Amanda says neck

92
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,952
It might sound like she's playing a game of chicken but she is completely serious

93
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:47,840
She says you may as well kill me now because there is going to be no money for me

94
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,936
And he looked at me very coldly and he said

95
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,568
Are you ready to die

96
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Noel King

97
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
And I'm sure I understand

98
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
Today on the show

99
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
Should you ever pay Ransom

100
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
In cases like this

101
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
We want two things

102
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
When someone is kidnapped

103
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
Governments and Families

104
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
Want to get them

105
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,488
But at the same time no one wants to pay terrorist or professional kidnappers lots of money

106
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,815
It just give the more resources and more reason to kidnap more people

107
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
In the future

108
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
Countries have been dealing with this problem at the

109
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,423
The highest levels more and more lately

110
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,543
The US and Canada have this no concessions policy we don't pay Ransom

111
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
Other countries do parents

112
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
So to get their citizens out

113
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,479
One of these approaches has to be right or at least more right than the other one

114
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
That is what Amanda and

115
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
Her family were going to find

116
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,647
Support for this podcast and the following message come from Madewell

Stop by a Madewell store or go to madewell.com

131
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,927
The men who took Amanda were a criminal gang

132
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,231
They weren't some big terrorist group

133
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,815
But they did tell her that they were soldiers in a holy war

134
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,399
And the question of money first came up right after she was take

135
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,239
She was being driven through the desert and she turned to one of the guys sitting neck

136
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
I think it was me that

137
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
Actually

138
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
Ask

139
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
Just outright is this about money

140
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
And he says

141
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
Yes yes it is

142
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
Anna first she's relieved

143
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
Which sound might sound

144
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Strange

145
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,391
But it was like okay they're not

146
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
Driving us out into the desert

147
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
You don't cut our heads off

148
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
But then a second later

149
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
It sinks in

150
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:58,911
My family my mom who is working at a bakery making minimum wage and my

151
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:04,031
Father were not going to be able to come up with me know whatever this

152
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,591
Ransom number was going to be

153
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
The number it turned out with one point

154
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
$5000000

155
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,991
It was probably a number that they picked at random

156
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,063
But it's a number that would freak any family out most

157
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
People don't have that

158
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
And even if they did have it there is this policy

159
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
My mother was actually

160
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,023
I mean not threaten to but she was certainly made aware

161
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
Of the fact that

162
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,375
Paying Ransom in Canada is against the law

163
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,727
And to pay around some and even to fundraise for a ransom actually

164
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
Is against the law

165
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
And holds like a

166
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
So you know a sentence

167
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,615
10 years in prison for doing that

168
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
We actually spoke to Amanda's mom her name is lorenda

169
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,015
She's back in Canada and now she's in the middle of this

170
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,879
She actually got the call from Amanda's dad and she remembers that she was visiting a friend that

171
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,999
And I thought okay I've got to get home and I got my car

172
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
And I was

173
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
Totally lost

174
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
I've driven the

175
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
100

176
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
X Factor

177
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
I couldn't find my way

178
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
Kept making on turns

179
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
I believe I was in shock

180
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,687
You might hear a Tremor in Lorinda Stewart voice Fair

181
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
She says that Tremor has been in her voice since this

182
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
Incident happen

183
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,111
Is she was about to start working with the government

184
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,671
What the government wanted was to get Amanda home

185
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
Without giving money to Criminal

186
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,535
They did have a protocol in place for cases like

187
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,375
They set up a Command Center in the town where Amanda's dad lived

188
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423
I'd had a war room with math

189
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Simchart

190
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Tin crafts

191
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,311
And when Adam and the other kidnappers would call and demand the ransom

192
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
There was a plan in place

193
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,687
Hostage negotiators were living with Amanda's mom around the clock

194
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
The train her to

195
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
Stay calm

196
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
Don't yell

197
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
Have an answer for every

198
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
She would say something like we can't give you money

199
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,159
But we can do things to improve your country

200
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
Like Bills score

201
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Delta Hospital

202
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
Florida says the government told her we do this all the time it works and they had said they had an impact

203
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
A couple

204
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Painting cost

205
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Just home

206
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
I thought well

207
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,127
Desk that's would be a win-win

208
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,919
A country is poor

209
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Good

210
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
Desperately

211
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
Use

212
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:28,415
Help but Amanda's captors didn't want a they wanted money

213
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
And this goes on for me

214
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
Remove Amanda from house to house

215
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
And things get worse

216
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
They beat her

217
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
She gets very sick

218
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
End

219
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
They rape her

220
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,823
She doesn't one point try to escape she slips out a window and actually makes it as far as a local Ma

221
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
But they catch her again

222
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:53,247
And all this time the kidnappers are calling Amanda's Mom they're calling larinda

223
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Dozens of times

224
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
They're threatening her they're giving her

225
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Terrible updates

226
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,439
And all of this is meant to get her mom to pay that rent

227
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,511
It was excruciating for

228
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,095
Need to have been on the outs

229
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
It was just

230
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
Beyond wet

231
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,871
Any parent should ever have to go

232
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Truth

233
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,455
And then after a year something big

234
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Chefs

235
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,551
Three people from the government call Amanda's mom into a me

236
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,903
They say look this isn't going how we hope we're not making progress

237
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
And we're dropping your case

238
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,511
I was in a bit of a panic and said like you guys

239
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:41,119
Promise me until you're dropping me lorenda says one of them tells her explicit

240
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679
It is still illegal for you to pay rent

241
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
But they say

242
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
No one has ever been

243
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Prosecute

244
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
For paying rent

245
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,335
The fellows who spoke

246
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,663
Comedian says basically told me what the low was

247
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
Then they

248
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
Told me that I had the freedom to

249
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
Go ahead

250
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
The Retton cement pay

251
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
Raise the money

252
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
And pay

253
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:08,767
So here you see the crack between the ideal version of how this policy works

254
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
And how it plays out in the real world

255
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,423
We actually reached out to the Canadian government to ask them about this and they told us

256
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
We don't comment on specific

257
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,567
Lorenzo says the agents told her call a private company that specializes

258
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
Types of negotiation

259
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
And she did

260
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
And they told her

261
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,711
Right away you are going to have to pay Ransom

262
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
Time to get your daughter back

263
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,087
But Amanda's family didn't have anything close to a million and a half dollar

264
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,391
So they tried to get the number lower

265
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:41,279
Meanwhile back in Somalia Amanda is overhearing these phone conversations and she can tell

266
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
It's not going well

267
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
They said to her

268
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
You think we're playing games

269
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
LCR game

270
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,775
These guys have been holding Amanda for a year expecting something

271
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,591
And they're being told no there's still no money

272
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
They were Furious

273
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
And Lorinda realized

274
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
She was going to have to get

275
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Some money together

276
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
I mean the love of a mother right she started

277
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
Booking meetings with

278
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:11,231
High-powered business people in the sit in the City of Calgary people that she did not know

279
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,839
But she would talk their secretaries into you know giving her 10 minutes

280
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,887
And then she would go in and she a little

281
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,215
Binder that she had put together with my pic

282
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,239
Picture on the cover

283
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,543
That was called Amanda's Adventures

284
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
And then inside where all these

285
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:32,223
Pictures of Meowth in the world and articles I had written and the most amazing thing

286
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
People gave I mean

287
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:42,463
Like thousands of people gave to my family I mean you know

288
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,559
$5 or $200,000 people gave

289
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
And then

290
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
What afternoon 15 months after she been kidnapped

291
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
A man came into the room where she was being held

292
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
Any song of her chains

293
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
And you put her into a car

294
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,079
And there was another long drive into the desert

295
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
In total silence

296
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
The sun went down and

297
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:05,247
It was dark when we kept driving remove tar from car to car in the dark

298
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
And after hours of this

299
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
They finally stopped

300
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
And then

301
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:14,975
A Somali man came over to the side of the vehicle and tapped on the window and I rolled it down

302
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
He hands me a cell phone

303
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,703
Really confused but I took it and I put it to my ear and my mother was on the other end

304
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
And she said to me

305
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
Amanda you're free

306
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
She was free

307
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
I had had

308
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,943
So many dreams in captivity like that

309
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
That I

310
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
What I did

311
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
In that instant was like I pinched my arm

312
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
And even though I could feel it

313
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,695
I was sure I'd like this was a dream

314
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
Okay listening to that

315
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
It's impossible not to rejoice

316
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
With Amanda

317
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,727
The thing is when her family paid ransom they did exactly what governments are trying to prevent

318
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
They gave money to

319
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
Two criminals

320
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,103
I mean I live with that every day and that doesn't feel good

321
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:09,503
Did we ban yes contribute to that ongoing problem globally of hostage-taking by

322
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,575
Rewarding these guys and paying them around 7 we dip

323
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
We definitely did

324
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,719
Do you agree with the no Ransom policy does that seem like an effective way to handle it

325
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
I actually think it makes

326
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Sense

327
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,703
I think the government position to not pay Ransom

328
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Is

329
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Put in place to

330
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
Protect us so that we don't

331
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
Become.

332
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,199
Targets of kidnappings from individuals who would look for

333
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Target's like that

334
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,271
This is kind of astonishing

335
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,367
Amanda Godfrey because her mom went around the policy

336
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,951
Still says she thinks this policy keeps us a

337
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:55,583
Like most people she believes that if you don't pay for hostages there will be no market for hot

338
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,679
Here's the really interesting thing about the no concessions policy

339
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
It's been around forever

340
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,775
But there haven't been many

341
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Detailed

342
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,103
Studies of whether or not it actually work

343
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
There hasn't been that much data

344
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
And then after 9/11

345
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,783
Because there was this big uptick in people being kidnapped by Terror groups

346
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
All of a sudden

347
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,623
We did have data we did have numbers

348
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
And people started to look at

349
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
One of them was Peter Bergen

350
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
Journalist and analyst

351
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Did the new America Foundation

352
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
And people were coming to him for answers

353
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
It began

354
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
With

355
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,775
Some family members of people who were taken hostage in Afghanistan to Pakistan I know a fair amount about the political

356
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,335
Situation in those countries when they came to me for advice

357
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,895
Paramount is actually a bit of an understatement

358
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:46,783
Bergen spent years in Afghanistan and Pakistan history interviewed Osama bin Laden

359
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,599
And it is possible that he could have been kidnapped

360
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
So Peter Bergen

361
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,791
And his Partners at the new America Foundation to get all this data and they start to analyze it and we focused on the plumbery difficult cases

362
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
People who were taken by

363
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Jihadist

364
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
Terrorist groups or

365
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
Other Insurgent groups

366
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,519
And in the end they have 1400 cases

367
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,127
And he looked at how government policy works out in real life

368
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
So okay there are two group

369
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
Oops there are the no concessions

370
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
The United States

371
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Canada

372
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
UK

373
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
And then there's a second

374
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
These are countries that will make a deal

375
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
The French the Italian

376
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Spanish

377
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Swiss

378
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
The Germans

379
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,535
They don't go around advertising it but these governments pay Ransom

380
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
They deliver cash

381
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
And they Market in their budget

382
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Has foreign aid

383
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,191
Tell the world has been running this kind of horrible experiment

384
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:41,567
And here's what Peter Bergin found the outcomes were Americans with twice as bad as the word for every other

385
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,919
Westerners and the only people who came close in times of bad outcomes where

386
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
The British

387
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
And when you say twice as bad

388
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
What do you think

389
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Well

390
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,831
Double the number of Americans

391
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
Proportionality were killed

392
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
By their captors

393
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,207
Americans are twice as likely to be killed in capped

394
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:04,351
This could mean killing Americans in and of itself has value as propaganda value

395
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,935
Or it could mean that Europeans paying Ransom get

396
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,703
People home

397
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
Or could mean both of those thing

398
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,103
But either way if not everybody sticks to the same policy

399
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
It's a problem

400
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,943
Yeah in front individual like a mandolin out there is a

401
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
Huge reason to break these rules

402
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,039
The new concessions policy is meant to

403
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
To prevent kidnappings and

404
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
To help posture

405
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,927
But the numbers were saying it doesn't do either of those

406
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,279
First there's no evidence that Americans are kidnapped less often

407
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,351
And there is evidence to suggest that Americans

408
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Do worse

409
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
In captivity

410
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
It's a policy that makes sense

411
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
On paper

412
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,799
But in the real world there's always going to be some poor mother

413
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
With a binder filled with pictures of her

414
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Burkett

415
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
And the system breaks down

416
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:54,015
Yeah we saw the system start to break down around the summer of 2014

417
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,367
Isis was holding American hostages and European Hast

418
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,975
The Americans were not paying Ransom but some of the Europeans were

419
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:08,351
So Isis was killing the Americans and letting the Europeans who paid Ransom go

420
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,703
After that summer President Obama starts a review of our policy

421
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
Is it keeping people

422
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,615
We talked to a couple of people who worked on that policy review and they told us

423
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,431
Obama saw that the system could be better

424
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
Until year later in 2005

425
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
Obama comes out and he announces

426
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
A very small

427
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,159
But very significant tweak to the no concessions policy

428
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,719
He said the government is still not going to pay rent

429
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
That is just

430
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Completely off the table

431
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
But for families who can raise money

432
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
Or even hire a private company

433
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
The government will not get in the way

434
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,751
And this means that money will go to Terror groups and it will go to criminals

435
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,799
That's what happened in Amanda's case

436
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,103
All that money her family raised

437
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,639
Disappeared into Somalia

438
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
And she thinks about this all the time

439
00:17:55,199 --> 00:18:00,831
Every person who gave to that Ransom understood that it was going to go to criminals and probably not be

440
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
Put to good use

441
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,951
But they had determined that my life

442
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Was

443
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
Worth it

444
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:13,631
And so I guess what I try to do with that is to live a life that

445
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
That is worth it

446
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,007
And she is very sincere about that

447
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,847
After she was released Amanda forgave her captors she really did

448
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,663
She thought about them for a long time and realize

449
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,503
They grew up in a country where there was no government they never had

450
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Champs

451
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
Until when she got home

452
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,391
Amanda raised more money to send to Somalia but

453
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,183
This time she knew where it was going

454
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
She started a foundation

455
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,535
To send Somali women and girls

456
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,303

We also relied on the reporting of rukmini callimachi who's reporting on Ransom payouts

For the New York Times is unparalleled

479
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
Thank you

480
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
I'm Noel King

481
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
And I'm Bryant or staff

482
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
Thank you for listening

483
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,759
So Bryant while we were reporting this there was actually a big update to Amanda Steele

484
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,039
Something that happened

485
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,063
After she got

486
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,111
The police set up a sting operation

487
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
To catch a

488
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,439
Adam the guy who is always calling her mom

489
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
For ransom

490
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
Time in Somalia

491
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
They tell him that's insane why

492
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,375
Which is an agent wants to give him a book.

493
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
That Amanda had forgiven him which is true

494
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
And he believed them

495
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
This guy

496
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,311
We spent more than a year terrorizing Amanda

497
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
Got on a plane

498
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
And flu

499
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,431
To Ottawa and police arrested him

500
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
At the airport

501
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,735
And he is in jail now
