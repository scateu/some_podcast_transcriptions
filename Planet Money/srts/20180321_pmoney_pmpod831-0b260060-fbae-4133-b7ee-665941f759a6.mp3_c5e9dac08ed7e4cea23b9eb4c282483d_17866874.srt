1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:07,680
A few weeks ago I went looking for

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:14,080
4 Gold I was slipping down a mountain in the Plumas National Forest in Northern California it has been snowing

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:20,480
Not warning for walking through the cedar trees kind of Misty and foggy

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:26,880
Is the Sun hits the snow sliding around

5
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:33,280
Only a guy named Josh Reinke through the forest big tall guy with a beanie and a beard he's

6
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:38,144
Carrying this big wide pan it looks like something you might make a stir-fry in

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,032
You get down the hill my goodness I hear the creek

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
There's this little Island In The Stream

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,384
I'm going to like

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
Just hop over

11
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,968
We get over the rocks

12
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,760
Josh takes the gold pan

13
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,064
Scoops up somebody gravel

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
Put in the water and I'll have to tell you this sunlight is just following on this pan

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,424
Like it's some sort of miracle

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
Forgot

17
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,824
Golden colored things

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,616
Okay

19
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,040
And then I see it glittering

20
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:33,440
Some small really small pieces see that right there

21
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:38,048
Certainly a little piece of gold

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,888
Listening back I sort of sound like Gollum in Lord of the Rings

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
That's what Google does to you

24
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,752
There's three little pieces for five 6 right there

25
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:52,640
1 2 3 4 5 6

26
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
You can say it

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,736
Eureka

28
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,320
So I'm super excited at the specs of gold

29
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
This Trace amount

30
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
But Josh isn't impressed

31
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:10,048
At that point you know of course I would do more research

32
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
Get bigger okay

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,168
Okay come on

34
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
We sent you out west

35
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,984
To make us rich

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,056
And you and Josh you're throwing away or treasure

37
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,384
What just threw away was just a tiny bit

38
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,200
But if we want a mine any of that gold

39
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
We need to

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
To stake a claim

41
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
In this part of the process

42
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
Is amazing

43
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
To stake a claim

44
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
You literally need

45
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
Estate

46
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
I could also use

47
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
Pool

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
Or just a pile of rocks

49
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,280
But today

50
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,816
I'm going to use a stick

51
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
What about this one

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,264
Way too long

53
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Take this thing putting it in

54
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,248
The dirt and we stick some paperwork on it

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,552
A mining claim location notice

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
It says Who We Are

57
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
And where we are

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
And the date

59
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,952
Okay so we're going to put it in a plastic bag

60
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,280
Seal it against the elements

61
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,352
Cool so

62
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
All we have to do is

63
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
Is put a stick in the ground fill out a form

64
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,984
And we're going to be millionaires right

65
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
First I have to pay

66
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
The thing is

67
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
The price I'm going to pay

68
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
It's what I paid for dinner last

69
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
15 bucks

70
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
I'm going to pay

71
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,296
$15 an acre

72
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
The prices like this

73
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
I just get one acre let's get 40

74
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Nick fountain

75
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:54,752
Assignment the proud owner of the Mining rights for 40 acres of

76
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
Triangle country

77
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
For not alot of money

78
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,616
Which can I say that is crazy

79
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
You did what

80
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
One day at work you're about to Pony up

81
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
Not a lot of money

82
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
And you get the mind as land for a year

83
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
And even if you find

84
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Tons of gold

85
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,136
You don't have to pay the government a penny more in royalty

86
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,720
Getting the rights to dig up gold in the US today

87
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,791
Not all that different than it was during the gold rush

88
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
Neither of the price

89
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
Today on the show

90
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,727
How has the system stay the same for almost a hundred and fifty years

91
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
Why is the country

92
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
Giving away its goals

93
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
On public land

94
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
And copper

95
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
Can silver

96
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039

Is available at aecf. Org

105
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,215
So once you got the wooden stake in the

106
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
You take a copy of your claim

107
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
You go down to the local office

108
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
Of the Bureau of Land

109
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
And you register your car

110
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,199
The one that handles the Plumas National Forest

111
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
The forest I went to

112
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
It's in Sacramento

113
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:16,415
Hey I'm making a mineral claim we found gold

114
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:23,071
How old are you like inside

115
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
Office I meet Gary catledge

116
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,167
Super friendly Jean sweatshirt

117
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
He helped me make sure I didn't claim anyone else's land

118
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,639
It was on a stream that flowed into it we had a bit of trouble finding my spot in the beginning

119
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:43,039
I'm looking at a map you think you're interested this piece right here

120
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:48,415
That says what does it say it says creek creek

121
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,047
We found my spot it was in Yuba County

122
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,607
Then we went online to make sure that no one else looks

123
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
We were good

124
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:04,287
Hey yeah I'm going to pay for a mining claim.

125
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,687
Came along way

126
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,271
I certainly did just like the old times

127
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
Just hike deal

128
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
If this seems like a system

129
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,927
That was designed by Prospectors in the mid 1800

130
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
That's cuz it kind of was

131
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
Emagine 1848

132
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
We find gold in Calif

133
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
A bunch of guys

134
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
Is Russia West looking to get rich

135
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
And they make up the sister

136
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,215
To make sure that no one gets killed over another person

137
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
What are these gold miners

138
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,311
Becomes a lawyer a senator

139
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
He goes to Washington

140
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
Once he gets there

141
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Formalize

142
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
The system he saw it West

143
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
He writes the law

144
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
The mining Act of 80

145
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
1872

146
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,855
And it's important to remember that back when the miners found gold

147
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
California

148
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
Wasn't even a US state

149
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
In the mid 1800 the US

150
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
With all about

151
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Westward

152
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:00,095
Expansion and the government wanted to make it as easy and as cheap as possible

153
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
4 people

154
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
To go out west

155
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Find gold

156
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
And settle down

157
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
In the slot it was part of that at

158
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,591
The thing is I came into a public forest and steak this claim for cheap

159
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
But it's not just amateur Prospectors that are doing it

160
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
There are billion-dollar Corporation

161
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
Also getting the same deal

162
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
It's a rip-off

163
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,879
The rip-off of the taxpayer

164
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
Tom Udall senator from New Mexico

165
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
Not a fan of the money Act

166
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Of 1872

167
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Just think about it

168
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
The public

169
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
Owns this land

170
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,423
This is a resource sitting on public land

171
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,031
Udall is part of a group of lawmakers who are working to reform this law

172
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
They want to change this old system

173
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
In the loafers

174
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,919
But what they're really looking to change

175
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,967
Is the way the federal government gets

176
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,783
Paid for mining that happens on federal lands

177
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,111
They want the mining companies to pay these things called

178
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Royalties

179
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Royalties

180
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
Lots of companies take lots of

181
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
Valuable things out of the ground

182
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,071
Oil for 1 natural gas call

183
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,887
And when they make money off those things

184
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
Maybe some of that money back to the governor

185
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
That's what royalties

186
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,775
Udo says in most places in the world

187
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
Mining companies

188
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
Do payroll

189
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
But in America mining companies

190
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,711
Don't pay royalties to the federal government

191
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,527
And we don't even know how much they're taking out

192
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
In 2011 I asked the

193
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
The GAO

194
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
Numbers on how much

195
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
The taxpayers are being short changed

196
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
They couldn't say

197
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Not only

198
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,351
Do the Hardrock mining companies not pay they don't disclose

199
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
And under current law they don't

200
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Have to

201
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
We don't know how much they extract

202
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,567
We don't know where the minerals are sold

203
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
And we don't know

204
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
The overall value

205
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
There was one report

206
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,759
In 2014 a house committee

207
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,831
Added up what they could find from publicly traded mines

208
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,135
Any figured that in one year

209
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,207
Companies who take in at least five billion dollars

210
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
Worth of gold silver copper

211
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
All these other minerals

212
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
Ida public lands

213
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,399
Last year you. Sponsored a bill to reform the 8th

214
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
1872 mining law

215
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,775
It would increase in fees and introduce a 2 to 5% Realty

216
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,103
Which could raise at least $100 a year

217
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
But it hasn't gone far

218
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,711
We always knew I mean and I knew

219
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
The beginning when

220
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
I got into

221
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
The house and then came into the Senate

222
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
When you put in a bill

223
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
On 1872 Monument

224
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
You were going to have

225
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
Huge opposition

226
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
From the mining in

227
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
You always had that

228
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Big block of West

229
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Western senators

230
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
Who just said no we're not doing

231
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,215
And and they were really acting on behalf

232
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
Of the mining

233
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
Western Center

234
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,783
I feel like Tom Udall is trying not to name names

235
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Pachulia

236
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
You know he's talking to

237
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,647
I think I know one of the guys he's talking

238
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Thinking about

239
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
Harry Reid

240
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,255
He was the most powerful man in the Senate

241
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
Senate Majority Leader

242
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
From Nevada

243
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
He stepped down last year

244
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
I made a request to talk to read about mining

245
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
And I thought it would be formal

246
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
A lot of policy

247
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
Betalk

248
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
It was not what I was expecting

249
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
First off

250
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,223
He invited me to his house so we're going through the gate

251
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:34,623
Hi Tennessee Senator Harry Reid

252
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:41,023
Harry Reid lives in this gated community near Las Vegas outside there's a pond

253
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,327
One full of ducks flying in and out

254
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,983
Security detail took me to the door

255
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:56,383
Meet you thanks for having me read shows me around his house his father was a gold mine

256
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,943
He tells me he has a bunch of his old stuff

257
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:05,343
He pulls what looks like a headlamp off of bookshelf

258
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,927
Create the flame using water and carbide no aux

259
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,719
Oxygen useful in a mine

260
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:17,375
Are you smell outside it's garbage in there

261
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,447
His house is like a museum of mine

262
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,287
There are these photos on the wall of his hometown

263
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,847
It's an old mining town called Searchlight

264
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,431
When he was little he used to go down into the mines with his dad

265
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,759
What do I would say keeping company

266
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:38,623
Because he worked it was a illegal but he worked alone in the mines but nobody ever came

267
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
Or not often

268
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
I can remember

269
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
The boy in Searchlight

270
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
Deborah Lane on a couch on

271
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,655
I do mother would pick rocks out of his back that would have their my dad had

272
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
Silicosis from

273
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
Courts in

274
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,335
Peroxy working and he talked every night

275
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
I just thought all kids dad's car

276
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
He shows me this rock in a glass

277
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
Frame hang on the wall

278
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,575
That is a very high grade or it look like a rock

279
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
I wouldn't have noticed it anywhere else

280
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,183
But this one his dad gave it to

281
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,767
Hi and he founded it to Blossom mine

282
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:23,167
And was in town connect nuggets anywhere that's pretty much anybody with me

283
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:29,567
My father committed suicide Australian man and he gave me this

284
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:35,967
The week before he killed himself if Harry Reid's house was a mining Museum the stories in

285
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
They were not happy

286
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Happy stories

287
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
If

288
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,439
I heard those stories would make me think that you wouldn't like my name you know

289
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
Well I have like mining

290
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,631
I wish I could give you a love story that your mind but I can't do that

291
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
My name is Harsh

292
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
And many times cruel

293
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
Add my own carbide lamp

294
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,823
Hold my dinner and watch them drill holes in

295
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Rock

296
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,431
Do all the horribly difficult hard things you have to do

297
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Hansel

298
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
I have warm feelings about

299
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
My memories of my

300
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
My dad

301
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
In the early 80s

302
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
Harry Reid came to washing

303
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,231
10 and he was from Nevada this mining state

304
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
He has this

305
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
Skip connection of Mining and

306
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
Obviously

307
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,863
Mining super important for Nevada

308
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,191
She realized if he didn't defend the mining law

309
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
It was going to change

310
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,031
And it was going to hurt the mining it

311
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
So we went to the mining companies

312
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
And he told them they needed to get organized

313
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,223
I have no presence in Washington Missouri

314
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
I met them

315
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
Reno Nevada all the

316
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
Isis

317
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
And I said you better

318
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Search

319
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,791
Binghamton what's going on the Washington you're going to wind up losing everything

320
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
I told him

321
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
Going to start getting your hands

322
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,423
Coming to wash my meetings with some of these senators

323
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,239
Which Senators would you tell them meet with

324
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,775
All the ones

325
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
I want on my side

326
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,919
Every once in awhile people would look around and ask the same question were asked

327
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
Driving Stakes into something

328
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
That sounds like a way to Vanquish a vampire

329
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
This isn't the 18th

330
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
Hundreds we have

331
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Computers

332
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
We're 50 servings

333
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
Why is this law

334
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
Still on the books we need to

335
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Updated

336
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Prince of royalty

337
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,631
And Harry Reid would be there saying you can't just tweak this thing

338
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
It would be unfair to mining cup

339
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,239
You Senators you don't understand mining

340
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
It has to be comprehensive reform

341
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
Comprehensive reform

342
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Issaquah

343
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
Classic Washington

344
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Stalling move

345
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
Time and time again

346
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
Reform would come up

347
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
And it would go nowhere

348
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:53,695
Everyone know nothing would happen the matter really I was there to do I couldn't change the law

349
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
Kasai green

350
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
I wouldn't agree

351
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,703
Why you smiling

352
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,055
And it wouldn't because you wouldn't let it well if you like them

353
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Okay but Harry Reid

354
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Is

355
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
John now

356
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
He's retired

357
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,735
So you don't want some other lawmakers there at it again

358
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,319
They're actually trying to push a Reform Bill through right now

359
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Harry Reid

360
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,647
He knew he was going to retire someday

361
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,463
And this mining Lobby he helped organize

362
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
Because of it

363
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,791
This Reform Bill doesn't really have a chance

364
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,375
In the meantime the mining Law Of 1872

365
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
It's still on the

366
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
West you want mining

367
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,007
Because you wanted to figure out the answer

368
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
A question

369
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
Right you want to figure out

370
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
Why the mining law

371
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Is the same as it was

372
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
Just after the Civil War

373
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
And I think you found the answer

374
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,295
I think it's partly because of this old narrative

375
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,879
When we think about the mining law who was designed for

376
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,183
We think of people like Harry Reid's.

377
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,487
Guy with his son and his

378
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
Carbide lamp

379
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,559
Are we think of me and Josh

380
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
In the gold pan

381
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
Steak

382
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,911
Imagining the wrong character

383
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,239
The real characters in the story today

384
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
They're big mining

385
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Companies

386
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,639
Yes mining is still about being rugged entrepreneurial

387
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
You have to go out and dig

388
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
Put the money at stake

389
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
It's not about the little guys

390
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
Not anymore

391
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:32,511
After the break

392
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
We tried to get

393
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
Out of the gold

394
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007

Hello

403
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
Did you hear me

404
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
Hey Josh

405
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Yeah this is him

406
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,839
A few weeks after I stake my claim I got on the phone with Josh

407
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,399
The guy who helped me find gold in California

408
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
And I had to admit

409
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,775
When we were in California you know we found the gold

410
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
I was so excited

411
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,359
I got Gold Fever

412
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,687
But I think I got a little

413
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,015
I mean

414
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:30,111
It doesn't really make a lot of sense you know I live in New York and

415
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,927
I have a job I can't I can't go

416
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,255
I can't go back to California and Prospect on that land

417
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
Yeah you're really trying to dump

418
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Disclaim

419
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,423
Yeah I tried to get him to buy it then and there

420
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
He wasn't up for it but he said he would ask around

421
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
What I can do is talk to my partner

422
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Maybe we can

423
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,407
Find someone in the group that stressed

424
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Put up the money

425
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
To do that

426
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
I can work

427
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:04,415
