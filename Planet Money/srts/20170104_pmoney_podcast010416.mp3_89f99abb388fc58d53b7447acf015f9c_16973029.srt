1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,584
Hey it's Robert here I'm going to read you a very

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:04,864
Very exciting

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,656
I never I should say that

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:09,984
Has gotten a lot of people excited the number is as of

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,264
158

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
PM it is

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,824
19000

8
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,104
900

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
25 point

10
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
1

11
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688
0

12
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,016
Which seems like a really boring number until you realize that it is

13
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
Just just

14
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,808
Just this

15
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,600
Close to 20000

16
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:32,256
I'm referring of course to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and it's got everyone super excited

17
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
Thousand

18
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
On Wall Street

19
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,752
3 top about a little over 50 points there and we're getting very close to a major Milestone 220 South

20
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,776
Thousand mark

21
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,336
Did the Dow Jones Industrial Average

22
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,872
Was up 91 points

23
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,408
At 19900

24
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
74

25
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
This is NP

26
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:56,320
NPR NPR does it to we get so excited by all those zeros

27
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,624
The Dow Jones Industrial Average

28
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,928
Traditional measure of the

29
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,232
The stock market back in mid-December starting

30
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
High people say

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,072
This is it 2016 the year

32
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352
But you're ended

33
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,960
Get over it couldn't pull off 20,000 before the year-end but my guest

34
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616
Called it back on October 5th that we would see 20,000 before the inauguration that's January 20th

35
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,664
Will it happen will it happen

36
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
Who cares

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,504
This is the thing about the doubt it doesn't

38
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
Matter

39
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,320
If you're a longtime listener to Planet Money

41
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,648
Hate the Dow Jones Industrial Average

42

And interplanet money in the how did you hear about a sec

79
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:16,096
Let's just start with a quick introduction what is this thing called the Dow Jones Industrial

80
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
Soaps this at Big complicated

81
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
Stock market thousands of America

82
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,752
Can companies or if you want to get really Global you know

83
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Tens of thousands

84
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
The companies all over the world

85
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,152
And people want to know how did that stock market do however

86
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
Investors looking at all those thousands

87
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
Soak the approach Dow Jones

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,528
Houses they just picked

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,088
30 large American companies

90
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,136
They take the share price of

91
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Each of those

92
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Adam up

93
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,744
And they divided them by a number

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,048
It's kind of arbitrary number that they made up called

95
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
The Dow divisor

96
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
And that is the Dow Jones

97
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
Industrial

98
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,960
And which companies are in that average

99
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,800
That's one of the first problems people have when they talk about what's wrong with the Dow because

100
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:02,944
Choice of a company's kind of seems arbitrary like they're all big but they're not the biggest companies in America

101
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,016
A lot of them like General Electric and Procter & Gamble

102
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,088
They kind of just seem like they're on there because I've been around forever

103
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,952
Stodgy it's a stodgy index Italy a company's don't to change

104
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
Frequently at all

105
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,583
This is John Chauvin he's director of the Stanford Institute for economic policy

106
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
You might notice

107
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
Wechat

108
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
Google

109
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,703
What are the door company

110
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
It's not on there

111
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,543
They're Facebook's not on their lot of companies to get a lot of attention

112
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,847
It's only got 30 companies

113
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
And by and large

114
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
These are old

115
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Companies

116
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
So I say the Dow is

117
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Is really

118
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
Is it the worst of it.

119
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,111
If I want to know how the American Stock Market is doing

120
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
I use the S&P

121
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
500

122
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
5000 cups

123
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
Most people who

124
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
Care about the staff use they have

125
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,631
Surprisingly 505000 respectively

126
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
Stocks in their indexes

127
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
A lot more than just

128
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
30 arbitrarily

129
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Chosen One

130
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,615
And they give you a much better sense of how the stock market overall is

131
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,687
Yeah it's not just the number of companies a

132
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
It's different

133
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,807
Between the Dow and he's other indexes also the way the Dow does its math

134
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
Is different the way they calculate

135
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,903
The industrial average is different than the way the other index

136
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,815
Kayla why are you being so polite it's not different the way the Dow does it is idiotic it is ridiculous nobody

137
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,143
Play nobody nobody thinks it's a good way to do it the way they have to be

138
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543
500000

139
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
Explain people how they do it and then

140
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,639
All right so let's just have a company

141
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,943
Caitlin and Kyle Collett very creative I know

142
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
I'm going to say there's a hundred shares

143
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
I'll sell them for a dollar

144
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,879
Okay and I'll be Adam Incorporated and Adam Incorporated

145
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,183
Chooses like all corporations get the juicy

146
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
Each Corporation

147
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,791
Sachuest how many stocks how many shares it's going to divide itself into 2

148
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
The Selden Market

149
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351
So I've decided I'm only going to have

150
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
Who shares I'm going to sell them each for $50

151
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,263
No even though Adam and I are selling our shares for very different prices

152
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
We were roughly the same size

153
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,383
This is what we call market capitalization or market cap

154
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,711
When you multiply the number of shares a company has X

155
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
Price of those shares

156
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
So I have a hundred shares at $1 each

157
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
I have a market cap of 100

158
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
And I only have two shares but there

159
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,439
$50 each so I also have a market cap

160
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
Of 100

161
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
Okay so we're the same size

162
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,327
Now let's say both our companies go up

163
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
10%

164
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
Yeah we have a really good month

165
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
They both got 10%

166
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,983
Your stock since it's divided into

167
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
100 small stocks 10%

168
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,615
Would a dime to each of those dollar shares

169
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,455
But mine because I only have two shares each worth $50

170
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,759
A 10% increase means each of those

171
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
Are now worth 50

172
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,855
The $5 I've had a $5 increase

173
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
MI share price

174
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,975
Even though both our companies are now still worth the same they're both worth

175
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,511
$110

176
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,095
Yeah we're both the same size we both gone up by 10%

177
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
But

178
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
The Dow

179
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,983
What the Dow really cares about is it cares about your $5

180
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
As opposed to my

181
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
Dime your $5

182
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
Totally overpowers my die

183
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,175
Because the Dow focuses on the share price

184
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,503
In fact if you had a good day you went up 10%

185
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,807
And I had a bad day I went down 10%

186
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,879
The net result would be the same the market was neutral

187
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,487
But the Dow would value it as a $4.90 loss

188
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,071
Just because I happen to have fewer shares than you

189
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
My stock price is

190
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
Way more influence

191
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,239
Now Adam I know the fact that the Dow does its mass this way

192
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
It drives you nuts

193
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,615
And of course you are not the only one John Chauvin from Stanford field

194
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
The same way

195
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,199
In fact he said doing the math this way

196
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
Is such a dumb

197
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
It could actually be

198
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Dangerous

199
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,343
Marissa's let's say that IBM

200
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
Did fantastic

201
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
And the other

202
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,463
But most acted poorly

203
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
The dower get

204
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,327
Confuse cuz it over weights I be having it might say the market

205
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
It's doing okay

206
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
Where in actually bostock's

207
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,703
Play poorly I just happens the one that they

208
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Overweight

209
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
Is doing well

210
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
So it's just kind of

211
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
It's honestly it's kind of a

212
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Mistake at the

213
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Way it was calc

214
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
Do you want to ask why do they do it

215
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Stupid way

216
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
What 1892 there were no cook

217
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
Computers

218
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
They did the simplest thing possible which is

219
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,391
Take the numbers and add them up

220
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
It's so this was

221
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
Very very simple thing

222
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
We could do rapidly even

223
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Before computers

224
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
And they've never change

225
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
Siri telling me the Dow is calculated

226
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
This way simply because

227
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
Back in the day when they started

228
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
The math with lahti

229
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
I think that's

230
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:48,895
Crazy like we have they do it like they do because they've always done it that way I'll be at

231
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,991
We all know people like that. That's why do they do this I've always done it that way

232
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
That's how the

233
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,855
It makes me think the Dalles sort of like a Luddite right that you don't want to respond to

234
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
New changes the new technology we have amazing

235
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Calculators Inc

236
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
Computer algorithms now that

237
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,303
Can complicate these really precise mathematical formula

238
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
We're sticking with this way

239
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,935
I don't disagree that you just said

240
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
I think that's right

241
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
Following the Dow

242
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
Is an activity

243
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
For Market amateur

244
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
Nobody who really is

245
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
Haymarket professional

246
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Taipei bachata

247
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,551
The Dow that want to say Caitlin there's a reason why the Dow

248
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Asos.

249
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
It's actually a simple business

250
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,695
The Dow Jones Industrial Average do they like the fact obviously they

251
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,791
The Dow is mentioned all the time they make money off the fact that they have the

252
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
Benchmark index

253
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:45,727
And they want to keep that going but the Dow Jones Industrial Average has one advantage only one over all the other one

254
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
More accurate as we've discussed it

255
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
Doesn't have a more clever algorithm

256
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
All it's got going for us

257
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
Is it really really

258
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
That we all know it

259
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:59,039
Until they never would want to change it to make it more modern because

260
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
That would destroy the one market Advantage it has

261
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
It's really

262
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
Really old

263
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,975
I like the Colonial Williamsburg of Wall Street

264
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,767
Did you say that

265
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,839
And the Dow is aware of the chrises

266
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,655
They know that people say this about them that people criticized

267
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
The way they do their math

268
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
And on their website they respond to it they've got this

269
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,823
5 questions about the Dow that you always wanted to ask

270
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
Number three addresses is very issue

271
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,199
Is a couple paragraphs long for the last two lines basically

272
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,551
Said all it says quote with little to gain except maybe a reduction of criticism

273
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,879
We have no reason to reweight the Dow to market capitalization

274
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
And there would be a lot to lose

275
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,463
All the history that is in pricewaiter

276
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:45,631
I love that they're basically fessing up like the only thing we gain is all you people who know we're full of it would stop saying we're full of

277
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
That's all

278
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,055
Why the Dow get so much attention why we're so much more Focus

279
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
It's on it then you know the S&P

280
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
500 or other indices

281
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
They say it's history

282
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Plain and simple

283
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
Keeshond Shogun again

284
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:07,391
The only thing going for the towel is it's a hundred twenty years old has a very long history people to follow it for you

285
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
Years until there's interest

286
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
Where it is now,

287
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
Dare to wear

288
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Wasn't I

289
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
T29 or whatever

290
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,095
It's been it's been here for all of our lifetime

291
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
In all of our parents lifetime

292
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
Maybe even our grandpa

293
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,751
Almost every other major stock index out there

294
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
Doesn't do the math

295
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,383
They don't focus on just the price of the stock as much as the Dow does

296
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,455
To try to figure out if I move in a stock price matters or not

297
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,551
They look at the whole size of the company of the market capitalization

298
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
The number of shares out there

299
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
* the price of those shares

300
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:44,767
So a lot of people say the one thing the Dow is really supposed to do to tell us what's going on in the stock market

301
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
It sucks is that

302
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,863
Chauvin says right now yeah

303
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,447
Things look good and things are doing pretty well in the stock market

304
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,543
But overall the Dow has a lot of flies it only has 30 stock

305
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,663
They don't represent all the major companies in America and they do their math in this crazy way

306
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
But you know who gives the doubt

307
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Power

308
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:08,575
It is not Dow Jones you know they'd provide the index yes but the people who give this index

309
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
It's way more power than it deserves Is Us

310
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
It is the media

311
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
Why was it is not planning

312
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,511
You've never heard us get all excited about the Dow Jones Industrial Average

313
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:22,911
But I will take NPR and I've talked to senior leadership here and I've made my case so far I haven't once but NPR

314
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:27,007
Reports the Dow Jones industrial average every hour during trading hours

315
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
And we

316
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,847
Lead news with it when it breaks a record

317
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,687
So do the newspapers it's not just cable news freaking out about it it's

318
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
Responsible sober

319
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Media Outlet

320
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
Play give it all of this

321
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Coverage

322
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
This is so puzzling.

323
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
Because I don't think you can talk to

324
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
Any Market professional or any academic Economist would say yes I think the average American consume

325
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
We we should know what the Dow Jones is doing

326
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,911
Every hour of the day and every day

327
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
Of the work week

328
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,263
In fact I talked to one guy who was particularly critical

329
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
Obsessive way

330
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
How covers the media

331
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
I asked him how often

332
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,455
Not everyday and I'm I'm one of the people responsible

333
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
That's John Crespo

334
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,831
And we were surprised to find out he was such an eloquent critic

335
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,367
People obsessing about the Dow

336
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:20,511
Because when we first talked to him for the story he was the editor and executive director of the Dow Jones indices

337
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
It was his job to track it

338
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,143
But he told us then that he didn't pay attention to it every day

339
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,519
And he said when you look back at Charles doubt the man who founded the Dow Jones Industrial Average in

340
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
1996

341
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,335
As far as he could tell

342
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,407
How's the Dow didn't bother to comment on it more than once a month

343
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
What happened how did

344
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
We develop this 24-hour fit

345
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
Fixation on the

346
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Wellcraft boats

347
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
It started like virtually all economic chain

348
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
With a panic

349
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,207
Panic of 1907

350
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:56,607
When I talked to press both be told me that the Panic of 1907 felt an awful lot like the Panic of 2007 and 2000

351
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,679
Can 8 there's this sudden severe recession Banks

352
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
For collapsing

353
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,311
Nobody can make sense of the economy everybody is desperate for some

354
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
Handy metrics

355
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Palace

356
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
Clearly in an insta

357
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Are we

358
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:15,039
Worse off today are we better off are we worse off this our than we were an hour ago

359
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
So they looked around and

360
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
They found

361
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
The Dow Jones Industrial Average

362
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,695
Took on a life of its own

363
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,767
Newspapers started referring to IT service

364
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Easy

365
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
Way of

366
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,351
Talking about how the overall economy is

367
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
And then it really took off during the Great

368
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Depression because

369
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:37,567
Obviously in the Great Depression people really wanted to know is this thing going to continue forever is this thing about

370
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
The end

371
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,407
General statistics that kind of Statistics we use now

372
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:45,247
The unemployment rate at Central were still very immature they were not very reliable so

373
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
The media have

374
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
This handy thing the Dow

375
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,135
It might satisfy that same need how's this

376
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
Economy doing

377
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
The thing is

378
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
What was true in 1907

379
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
What was true in 1937

380
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,375
What was true 2007 and what is true today

381
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,447
Is not only the Dow Jones Industrial Average

382
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
A lousy way to know how to

383
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
The stock market is doing

384
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
Even the best measure

385
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
S&P 500

386
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:15,967
The Wilshire 5000 whatever the best measure of the stock market is not necessarily going to help you understand

387
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
How the overall a

388
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
Economy

389
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Doing

390
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:26,207
Yeah I mean it doesn't tell us about you know the things we care about about GDP the growth of the overall economy about housing

391
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
About jobs

392
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
John Sandford says

393
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
The stock market

394
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,911
Turn always match up with what's going on in our real economy

395
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,959
The Dow and and

396
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Stock market

397
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
The General

398
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
10

399
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
Stu

400
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,127
Do better the economy grow faster than the economy

401
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
I think it's

402
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
Correlated

403
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
With the economy

404
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Far from perfect

405
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,391
Reasonable gauge of how corporations are doing but after all we're interested to have workers

406
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
You're doing as well

407
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
And it doesn't

408
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
Gates that

409
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,791
It wouldn't be my number one gauge

410
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
App for the Econo

411
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
There's been

412
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:10,495
Plenty of times where the stock market in the Dow have done very well exactly when there's massive layoffs and low

413
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Lots of unemployment

414
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:18,175
There have been lots of times where the Dow Jones goes up and wealth increases among the people who own stocks which

415
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,503
Which is disproportionately the 1% or the top 10%

416
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:27,647
You know the bottom 50% of the country by income has virtually no stocks at all

417
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,695
And so very often when you're

418
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,535
Celebrating the Dow Jones going up what you're celebrating is something that

419
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
Might be problematic

420
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
Layoffs

421
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
More income inequality

422
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:44,287
It might not necessarily be that way either it's just the Dow is just such a lousy measure of everything it doesn't real

423
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,079
Tell you anything

424
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,639
About how the economy is doing for the

425
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
Wechat Planet Money we look at

426
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,783
A lot of indicators but how the economy is doing we look up courses

427
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
Employment rate

428
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Look at overall G

429
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
GDP growth we look

430
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
Look at income and Welfare

431
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Inequality

432
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,231
I'm pretty sure that never in a meeting or just

433
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Stand around the hallway we

434
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,815
Have ever discussed the Dow

435
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
Other than to talk about

436
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
How much we

437
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
As always work eager to hear what you think about Today show I would love to see a full-throated defensive

438
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
The Dow

439
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Or

440
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,015
Join us in hating on it at Planet Money at NPR. Org
