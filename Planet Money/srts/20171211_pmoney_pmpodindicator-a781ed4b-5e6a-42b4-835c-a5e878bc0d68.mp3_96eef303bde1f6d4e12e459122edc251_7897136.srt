00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,096
Hey everybody Stacey Vanek Smith here

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:06,656
And we plant money has a big announce

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,448
We are launching a new podcast

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:15,360
I'm hosting it along with Cardiff Garcia hey Carter Stacy and you just come to us from the financial times and the

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,384
FTL

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,432
That's right in our new podcast

7
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,456
Called the indica

8
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,736
This is Planet Money

9
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,504
Take on the news

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,040
It's going to be several times a week

11
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:26,624
About 5 minutes long and mostly about work business and the account

12
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:33,280
If you're a longtime listener you will recognize the indicator as part of the early days of Planet Money and now it has its own show

13
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,816
And here's a recent episode

14
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,888
Why your paycheck hasn't gotten any bigger

15
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,704
Even though the economy has been doing pretty well

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,728
Great Wave mystery

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,776
The Great Wave mystery how to listen

18
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,312
If you like it will help you

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,016
The job market was a bleak

20
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,040
Place 9 years

21
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,880
Rick Ellenberg saw this firsthand he has an employment office

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
In Asheville

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,464
Been through the tough times

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,024
When we lost a lot of manufacturing

25
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,560
They were probably

26
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,120
10 people for every job that was

27
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,912
This may be available at that point

28
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,448
Time today he says

29
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,984
At least one thing is

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,288
Is different now we see just the office

31
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,592
10 jobs for every

32
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,128
One applicant out

33
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,152
Is that right

34
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:25,248
It's it's just really really been white-hot a long time in our job market

35
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,272
But not everything

36
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:31,904
Things change for instance back when times were bad says Rick most jobs he had tended to pay around $9

37
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
And now

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,976
Cavity tables have turned

39
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
What are the jobs pay

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
Around

41
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
$9 an hour

42
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
This isn't only happening

43
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
In Asheville right

44
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
This is happening all over the

45
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
The country

46
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,728
Companies that hire lot more

47
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
People but for some reason

48
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,288
They are paying them

49
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
They aren't competing

50
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
For all those workers

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
So what we're seeing is it wages or only gradually

52
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Grindingly

53
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
Grudgingly

54
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
Rising

55
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,064
That is very poetic Cardiff thank you

56
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
On today's indicator in economic mystery with unemployment so low why are wages growing

57
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
So slowly

58
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,104

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
2.5

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
According to numbers from the federal government released this morning

69
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,728
Average hourly earnings for American workers Rose

70
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
2.5% over the

71
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
The past year

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
Once you take inflation into account

73
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,640
Are we just have barely risen at all

74
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,712
Yeah and this is a mystery not just for Rick Nashville

75
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
By the way it's

76
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,040
Something has been debated really heatedly

77
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,368
Buy Economist everywhere because there's no clear single answer

78
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,208
But they have dug to the data and then come up with a few possible ideas

79
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
Clear they haven't solved the mystery

80
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
Siri just yet

81
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
But they suggested a few

82
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
Possibilities

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
Is your explanation

84
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Competing with each eye

85
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
With no clear winner yet

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,032
Socure are three possibilities for why wages have been rising so slowly

87
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
The workers themselves

88
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Changed

89
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
What about the people who are looking for jobs with a different than they were five years ago or they younger or older different set of skills

90
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,320
What we're saying basically is that a much younger

91
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
Job the talent coming to us

92
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,672
American workers are getting

93
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,024
Baby Boomers are retiring and Millennials are now the largest group in the world

94
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:50,144
Enforce on average a 25 year old is just going to make less money than a 55

95
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,472
Yeah young people that get their crappy starter jobs.

96
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
Pay that much money

97
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
Older people retire from the

98
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
A higher wage jobs

99
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,640
And Gilberto averages therefore just held back a bit

100
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
Write this is just math

101
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
It's not really

102
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:09,856
So this could explain part of the reason why wages have been rising so slowly but even if you would just for age

103
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
We just just

104
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
Aren't moving up the way that they should be

105
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
There is something else

106
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,768
And that brings it to Theory number two

107
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
It brought tears by Michael Munger

108
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
The other reason is robot

109
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,775
The other reason is software and that's that's a hard thing to get around me robots are cool robots or something you can do

110
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,847
Look at software is so boring reason number two

111
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Robots

112
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
And

113
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,223
Software apparently and I like robots

114
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
And also check

115
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,855
As we know robots have been taking jobs

116
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
The factory workers

117
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,023
But what manga says is now robots and software are starting to move into the white-collar territory as well

118
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,607
So for instance every small business around the country used to have

119
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Ebookee

120
00:04:54,143 --> 00:05:00,287
And now watch the knot that is not the case that job is gone and that person has been replaced by

121
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Software

122
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
Quick

123
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,127
Read if you think about it is robots

124
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
Software

125
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,479
Technology and Automation in every other category than Mike mother wants it

126
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,039
Include as they all take over more jobs

127
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Economy hostel

128
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
We just

129
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,623
The people lost their jobs have to find

130
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,391
New job

131
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,183
And some of the jobs end up taking

132
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
Just don't pay asthma

133
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,535
Meanwhile the people who already have jobs

134
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,863
I'm more nervous about asking for a raise because they worry that Valby

135
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
And by the way this weed mystery

136
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,983
Happening at a moment when company profits are really

137
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
Hi says this is a problem

138
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,847
Because one of the core arguments in favor of

139
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Capitalism

140
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
Is there something

141
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
Apparently Fair

142
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
At the core of it

143
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,967
When the system is working

144
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
Everybody benefits in some way

145
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Play the rising tide

146
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,367
And if that's not happening says Munger

147
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
That is a big problem

148
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
It means that you can't you can't

149
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:54,303
With a straight face make that argument about Equity it means that

150
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
There's

151
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
The benefits of

152
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
Economic performance are not equally shared

153
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,495
Okay so that's their number 2 robots

154
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Robots

155
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
And a few other things

156
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,871
And that brings us to Theory numbers 3/4 why wages

157
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
I've been growing so slowly and Stacy I have to

158
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Baconfest

159
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
This one's my favorite

160
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
All right what is it

161
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
There's still a lot of

162
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
People on the

163
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
The sidelines

164
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
So yes the official unemployment rate has absolutely

165
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Plummeted in the last

166
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,463
Down to 4.1%

167
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
But that number also leaves out a lot of

168
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
People specifically

169
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,607
It leaves out one group of people who want a job

170
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
And can't get one button

171
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
This is important they also have an act

172
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
Tivoli look for one

173
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,799
In the last month so maybe they've been dealing with a family emergency or they've been

174
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,639
Taking care of your kids or maybe they just didn't see a job in the last 4 weeks if they wanted to

175
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,735
Yep and it also leaves out people who work part-time but would rather have

176
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Full-time

177
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,855
None of these people are officially counted as unemployed just because of how the government

178
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Categorize

179
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
Right after the financial crisis

180
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
In the recession

181
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
There were a lot of them

182
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
What is more jobs are created

183
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,071
Employees of hired more of them in meanwhile

184
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
The part-timers

185
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
I've been getting more

186
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
But until now

187
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
Force haven't had to offer them a lot more money

188
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,751

193
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
To where it was

194
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
