1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,072
If you years ago Argentina was in the city

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,864
Situation that might sound a little bit

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,168
The country had just elected

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,752
Charismatic populist president who said she was going to fix

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:11,776
The Argentina

6
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,080
Her name was Cristina Kirchner

7
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
She said

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,896
Argentina isn't making fee

9
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,176
We need to make

10
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,712
And so she had this idea

11
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:23,296
She's going to bring manufacturing from Asia and Mexico

12
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,064
To Argentina

13
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,112
Indian population

14
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,160
Tegan must be confessed

15
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,280
Looking dresses

16
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,120
Crusher started pressuring companies to make things in Argentina

17
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,960
Huge taxes on things that were manufactured overseas

18
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,264
Axes like 30 + 40%

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,128
And for some other things including certain kinds of electronics a Kirchner went even further

20
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,176
Are there she said you cannot import these

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,736
At all if you want to sell them in Argentina

22
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,760
You have to make them

23
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,528
In Argentine

24
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,088
Hugo bonifacci nice August 1st

25
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
Sorry

26
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,160
Sorry for my English

27
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:00,928
Stacy

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,976
Know your English sounds great

29
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,280
Is not true

30
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,632
Hugo was a systems engineer at a Manufacturing Company in a remote part of Art

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,192
It was it was a pretty small operation about

32
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
60 employee

33
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
And then right around 2010

34
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Give or take

35
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,848
The president of Argentina makes this law that says

36
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,896
All these things have to be made in Argentina

37
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,200
And suddenly Hugo's world is like

38
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,224
Wheatley trans

39
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,320
Overnight these giant shipping containers full of parts

40
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,880
And Machinery fall this new Manufacturing

41
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Start showing up

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
Outside his office

43
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,720
We don't come water house

44
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
To do Astoria

45
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,328
So all the parts would arrive and you didn't have anywhere to put them

46
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
Yes Yes Y'all right right

47
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,984
Some people are in your house you have a space

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,776
So did he put

49
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,336
Machinery in his house he said no he was

50
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,664
Never actually came close he said it came

51
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,736
A lot of those containers full of equipment had

52
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Cell phone

53
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
Heart smartphone

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,160
Because one of those things that Kirchner said you cannot import it all has to be made in Argentina was

55
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Cell phones

56
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,256
Some companies like apple in the iPhone for example

57
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,400
Would not play ball meaning you just Apple doesn't sell iPhones in an iPhone in Argentina

58
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
Okay but other company said okay

59
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,776
We will give it a try including the company that made

60
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Blackberries

61
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:25,664
Honestly I didn't even know BlackBerry still existed in Chicago

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
He's dead

63
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,712
People still use MySpace anymore

64
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,040
But this was back in 2011 and was a hot

65
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
Phone is the most

66
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
Popular phone in art

67
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,208
Celebrities and politicians were all carrying blackberries around

68
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,744
He was kind of like the It phone

69
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
Xi'an Cantina

70
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,632
Everybody was crazy for Blackberry

71
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Blackberry was on

72
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
Icon

73
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
At the time of blackberries were assembled in Mexico in

74
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
I'm hungry what are the parts were made

75
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,616
But Argentina was a really important market for

76
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
It's a lot of phones there

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,504
Increase your cell phone ban was costing them more than a hundred million dollars a year

78
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,088
So Blackberry agreed to try and make phones in Argentina

79
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
Partnered up with Hugo's company

80
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,696
And some leave this company in this little town

81
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
Was responsible for making

82
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
All of the blackberries for all of Argent

83
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
Millions of

84
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Production

85
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
Explode

105
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,383
The Blackbird story is really part of a much much bigger story about

106
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
President Cristina

107
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
And how she

108
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:39,039
Came into office with this plan to really control the entire Argentina con

109
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,343
Turn all the dials on the account

110
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
She wanted

111
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
Exports to change an Imports to change and she started making all these rules like there was one that said like okay if your company and you

112
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,815
Import stuff you also have to ask

113
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,119
Sports writers like we got to export stuff

114
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,703
She went up with these ridiculous things like there was actually a portion

115
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
NRG

116
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
Your personality got import Porsche

117
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,127
So what this guy did was like he's like well my family has a Vineyard so I guess

118
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,991
I'll get into the wine business and he starts shipping wine overseas just so he can import Porsche

119
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
Mitsubishi Galant

120
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,855
Peanuts and Subaru started exporting tons and tons of

121
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Chicken

122
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,391
Future

123
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,231
No one Christian would tell companies you have to make stuff in Argentine

124
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
You didn't always stop there

125
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
She would sometimes get very

126
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Specific

127
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,191
In case of blackberry should a very particular part of Argentina in mind

128
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,751
West Nickel and blackberries South America up

129
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
Operations

130
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,103
The law was that you had to manufacture it down to the very southern tip of Art

131
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Tierra Del Sol

132
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,319
Just makes you want to set up shop there as manufacturing hub

133
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Fire

134
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,719
Do you know if we go is an island in the south of Archer

135
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
It is actually wear boots

136
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
4 in

137
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,863
It is manufacturing hub

138
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,983
Is one of the most remote places on Earth and it has a really

139
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Harsh environment

140
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,567
It's cloudy all the time. The wind is always ripping through

141
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
It is hard to get to

142
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,919
The roads are terrible there are many fights in or out

143
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
Argentines call it

144
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
The end

145
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Of the Earth

146
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
There's some colorful language I don't use it

147
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,879
Fairview out if it did that that just talked about how far away

148
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,975
Scared of regulars from the rest of the world is really in the middle of nowhere

149
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,327
It would be like if Apple suddenly had to make iPhones on a little island off the

150
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
Alaska

151
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
What was Nicole says there was a logic

152
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
Wasn't an economic logic it was

153
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
Political life

154
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
That was one of the

155
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,311
Population basis that was really supportive of

156
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner

157
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
Help her get elected in so she was

158
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
If you wanted to pay back those constituents and

159
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,271
Provide jobs for them and then says she is really forcing this issue

160
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
I totally went up

161
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,623
Setting up shop in Tierra del Fuego and working with Hugo's company

162
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,951
Animal Hugo has spent his entire career working in fact

163
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
Uses blackberry's operations were just

164
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
On another love

165
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
The factory said was like a work

166
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
Are there was a

167
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,679
Queen room with all these very sophisticated monitors that would like

168
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
Keep track of tiny part of

169
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Dust

170
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,567
There was state-of-the-art Machinery there was really high security

171
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
Ben 10 all the stuff getting it all set up took

172
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Like a year

173
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,687
And even once they had the factory they were missing

174
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
Another key

175
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
Sing another key element

176
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
People

177
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,319
They needed like 2000 worker

178
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
Come in and make all these phone

179
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
They start having to work

180
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
True people from halfway across the country

181
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,231
Free to come move to this town to work in the fact

182
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
Hugo says that was not easy

183
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,375
You know they are the weather conditions here are very very hard

184
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,935
Okay for the people

185
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
I know she's dead

186
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Salary

187
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:44,127
Yo so in order to get people to come to Tierra del Fuego to fill all these jobs they had to offer

188
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Really high salary

189
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
Very high salary yes

190
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527
Three times with that job would

191
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Pay in another part of

192
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
Not to mention really great pensions

193
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,023
They make all these changes they recruit all these workers and within a year Hugo says the manufacturing companies working for

194
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,839
Goes from 60 workers to more than 2000

195
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
And

196
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,679
2 years after Argentina cell phone ban

197
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,495
First Argentine Blackberry rolls off the line

198
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,287
Eagles still remembers the MoMA

199
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,103
Yes yes you are everybody

200
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:20,479
Walking the line CD first really everybody was crowded around to see it

201
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
Yes everybody

202
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,087
This was a moment of Triumph for president

203
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,391
She had created thousands of jobs

204
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,207
Good high-end manufacturer

205
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,559
They're creating this product that everybody loved and it's super high-tech

206
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,887
So the moment this comes off the line like all of the politician

207
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
Come out to see it

208
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Singapore

00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
Diputado Sunday

210
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
Many many politics A-OK

211
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,383
We want to see the Blackberry want to

212
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,687
Take a picture when they open at 8 on Sunday

You got this picture

216
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
Do you send a campaign Politico

217
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Campaign

218
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,647
Including the president herself

219
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,255
Cristina Kirchner made a big announcement about the first Argentine BlackBerry

220
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
People with crazy

221
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,583
In the news clip we found for speech therapy

222
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
For 4 minutes

223
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143

Crusher starts Deliverance really

229
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
Passion Spa

230
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
About how Argentina is going to be

231
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
A great Center for manufacturing

232
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,527
About bringing jobs in from overseas

233
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,343
And then there's this amazing MoMA

234
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
Krishna holds the record for the crowd to see

235
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
Does book do you know what this is

236
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
This is the

237
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
First Argentine BlackBerry

238
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,327
Made in Tierra del Fuego

239
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Meetup

240
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
7 Cal pistol

241
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
BlackBerry

242
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
This is an incredibly

243
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Siding mold

244
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,199
First Hugo and for all of his thousands of coworker

245
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Focusrite they have

246
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:01,087
They have done this miraculous thing in Tierra del Fuego to have made this state-of-the-art

247
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,647
He wasn't to get a little carried away at one point

248
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:08,511
He was giving a press to her and you so proud of this phone that he told one of the reporters if you can find

249
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
Any difference

250
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,631
When this phone that we made in Argentina and a Blackberry made anywhere else

251
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
I will give you this phone is

252
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
I still got my boss

253
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,519
Say Google I see you

254
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,127
Luckily no one was able to find it

255
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,199
Blackberry Argentina was doing

256
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
Great and you know it wasn't just black

257
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,063
Rewrite these new rules that the president put in place

258
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
Grove okay

259
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,647
Kinds of manufacturing to Tierra del Fuego

260
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,999
Laptops flat screen TVs microwaves air conditioners

261
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,327
Everything you can think of was being manufactured in Tierra del Fuego

262
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,471
The populations growing stores are opening money is flowing in you know people are driving around in Range Rovers

263
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:55,359
And the rest of Argentina was doing pretty well too in fact the New York Times And The Guardian published editorials about

264
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
Great job Krishna was doing

265
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,711
When Helen called it the turnaround Tango

266
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
Terrible headlines

267
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Spell

268
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
Every time it's got to be the tango

269
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
The point.

270
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
Jacob is it Christmas plans like

271
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,327
Strong-arming companies to start producing things in this remote part of Argentina

272
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
It was working

273
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
My Spidey senses

274
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,447
Just tingling I feel like it's not going to

275
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Keep working

276
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
There were a couple

277
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,567
What problems so first of all this setting up to the long-term

278
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
And so by the time the first Blackberry rolled off

279
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
The line

280
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
The model was 2 years old

281
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,735
In the world of cell phones you know it's like

282
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Totally out

283
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
And in addition to that it was

284
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Expensive

285
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:42,207
In fact the Blackberry Argentina was twice as expensive as newer Blackberry models in the US

286
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:47,071
So now president person who set up this you know manufacturing Miracle has a new problem

287
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,655
She's made companies manufacture phones in Argent

288
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,751
But you cannot make people in Argentina buy those phones

289
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,871
And this created a very interesting business opportunity for some enterprising argentines

290
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,527
I talked to one guy who smuggled blackberries and Argentina would hide them in pairs of shoes in his suitcase or stuff them into his

291
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
Socks before he walked through large intestine

292
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,647
Well you know you have

293
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
Soccer socks

294
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,767
Baseball socks now those that are quite tight over the knee socks

295
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,095
Yeah so you just like kind of put them if they be like against your leg

296
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
Outlook how many can you carry in your sock

297
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
How many you think you can carry in your sock

298
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,359
Why I've never tried but like I don't know what

299
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
4 in each stock is that too much

300
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
You could probably do 4

301
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
Feel like you have 8 phones in your socks

302
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
I don't trust this guy one day

303
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,999
You saw a little business going Jacob he would buy blackberries for

304
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
For $200 a piece in the US

305
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,839
And you would sell them on a website in art

306
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
For $400

307
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
And that was still cheaper than the arch

308
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
BlackBerry

309
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
Was also a better phone

310
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Cheaper and better

311
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,823
How many phones overall

312
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Did you sell juice

313
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
Collie

314
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Morning

315
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
50

316
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
Prophet

317
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
$10,000

318
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,903
You can't afford to not smuggle phone

319
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
And that surprisingly with

320
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,535
Enterprising argentines walking through customs with their socks with a phone

321
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,351
Sales of the original Argentine BlackBerry

322
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
Started to drop

323
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,423
Why would you get a worse phone for more money

324
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,031
And West Nickel but I work for Blackberry said the Tierra del Fuego manufacturing plant

325
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
Started making less

326
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Unless I can

327
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,919
They just came to a point where the business case was unjustified

328
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
We just couldn't afford to do it

329
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:45,087
Less than 2 years after Cristina Kirchner hellbat first Argentine BlackBerry

330
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Up to the cheering crowd

331
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
The last

332
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
Argentine Blackberry roll.

333
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,511
Hugo bonneval Cheney remembers Atwell

334
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
How did you feel when Blackberry left

335
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
Wilson OTC for us

336
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
Kamal Khan

337
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
How old am I

338
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,055
So it left a bad taste in your mouth

339
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,615
Yes yes that's why you stop automatic

340
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Bitter

341
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
Bitter taste

342
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,015
Crushers government had invested 23 million dollars

343
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
In the Black Parade

344
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,855
Not to mention $6,000 per worker

345
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Per month

346
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
That was all up in smoke

347
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,487
And Hugo watch this company go from mm workers

348
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Down to 600

349
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,095
Last year he got called into the bosses office

350
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
And was told

351
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
Your job is

352
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,727
What's Valley exchange date

353
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
My feeling because

354
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Call Sierra

355
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,127
In this company is not going to work if they say

356
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Yeah

357
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
Betty botter

358
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
Birthday the people

359
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
Is very angry everyday

360
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,647
The people is very worried every day you are thinking about who will be there next

361
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
This is happening at factories all over Argent

362
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,791
Sales are going down people are getting laid off

363
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,607
And more broadly the Argentine economy is

364
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Starting to fall

365
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,935
All of kirchner's economic controls

366
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,471
Unraveled kind of olive

367
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
It got really bad

368
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,591
Inflation hit 40% 40% in a year

369
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,407
Yeah and Prices rose for everything

370
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
Food prices more than doubled

371
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,527
And a lot of companies that have been strong-armed into setting up shop

372
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,319
In Argentina started pulling out

373
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,159
Them to get a sense of where the story about Argentina Falls infertile

374
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,695
Greater economic contacts

375
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
We talked to Eduardo Levy yet

376
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
He's an economist in Argentina

377
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
He says the biggest problem with kirchner's

378
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
With protectionism in general

379
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
Is it while the government was spending money

380
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
Energy propping up Argent

381
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
Manufacturing

382
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
Wasn't investing that money in areas

383
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Where Argentina

384
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Could compete

385
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
On a global scale

386
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:48,223
Movie kind of like if Mozart has been all this time and money on ice

387
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,807
Do Yeti says this set the whole country back

388
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,879
So we're losing time we're losing

389
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Badly needed time

390
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:03,583
Sooner or later we'll need to leave the protection but by the time we do that we have lost 10 years in which we could have

391
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,143
We would have a chance

392
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:12,031
And you know there are sectors where Argentina is a competitive exporter where they make

393
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
Stuff the rest of the world once you know

394
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Beef

395
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
And wine

396
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,175
Biofuels these are all strong industry

397
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
So

398
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,527
This is like problem a right they've been

399
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
Putting all their money in the wrong Indus

400
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
And then you have problem be

401
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
Now you have created all these

402
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Is jobs

403
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,231
That are economically not sustainable

404
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,559
So put some point you know that protectionism is going to go away

405
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,375
And all of these people who got these new jobs are going to be

406
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Exact

407
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,751
An Argentina elected a new president who ran on this platform of wanting to get rid of a lot of

408
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,055
Open up trade with the rest

409
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
The world

410
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
But if he

411
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
He does that

412
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,223
Places like Tierra del Fuego plays with the whole economy has been built around these protectionist policies

413
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Could collapse

414
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,855
Hugo bonify Cheney did manage to get a new job about a month after

415
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
He was laid off

416
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,439
From his old one but he says he's been luckier than most

417
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,487
And he's really worried about a lot of his friend

418
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,559
In Tierra del Fuego there have been huge strikes

419
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,863
And some workers pensions haven't been paid

420
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
In months

421
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
Manufactured

422
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
Things stuff

423
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
Still really expensive

424
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
In Argentina

425
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
A basic car cost

426
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
$50,000

427
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,663
A middle-of-the-road phone cost more than $1,000

428
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,479
And in Argentina you still

429
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
Can I buy a knife
