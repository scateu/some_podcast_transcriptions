1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,048
Just a quick warning

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,096
Today's show has some adult

3
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:04,864
Themes

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,960
Last week I was in central New York

5
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,240
In the town of Oneida

6
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,544
It's really beautiful up there is

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,104
Blue Mountains and rolling fields

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
Farm houses

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,456
Exploring this place called the mansion house

10
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:23,552
It's this massive Brick House on a hill with a blue slate roof

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,600
It was built in 1862

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,904
Back then back in the 1800

13
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,952
The mansion house with a communist

14
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,256
Hundreds of people live there together

15
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,072
Many of their descendants actually grew up in this

16
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:35,840
House

17
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,656
Kelly Noyes Rose was showing me around the base

18
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,448
Look at the tunnel

19
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,984
Still drippy where it used

20
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,288
We're she and all the other kids used

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
Play it was our

22
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
Playhouse

23
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
This house

24
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,640
Really

25
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,944
Tons and tons of kids

26
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,248
It was sort of free and open it was

27
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,552
It was our family's house right

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,648
And then I went to the library where I met Nola DeSimone

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,464
She's also a descendant of the communist

30
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,256
She actually still lives here

31
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,048
She was visiting with all noise

32
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
They're both 82

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
We are two days apart in age

34
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,192
And how are you related

35
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728
We are first cousins

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,056
Back when they were growing up their parents worked for

37
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,080
The company

38
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,128
The company was Oneida Limited

39
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
The flatworm

40
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,200
Knives and spoons and forks

41
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,504
Oneida had a very big Factory up

42
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
Did you get Oneida silver when you got married

43
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,856
What pattern

44
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,952
Raining beauty that was very playing and what the little crown

45
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,744
And how about you did you guys use Oneida

46
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,096
Did we run out of town probably if you did

47
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
Their parents owned the Oneida company

48
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
Honest Kids

49
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,008
You guys had a very idyllic All American Life

50
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
But the Oneida

51
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,848
Communes that came before the company

52
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,408
That hoodie very colorful history

53
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
But wasn't discussed

54
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
No I don't think

55
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
But

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,856
I agree with you wholeheartedly wasn't discussed

57
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Also

58
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,928
The people who had practiced that

59
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
We're gone

60
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
The practice was

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
Spouse swapping

62
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
Pre-loved

63
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
The Oneida kahmune had

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Some sex.

65
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,704
The Oneida company was a place where they took all that sex stuff

66
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
And put it away

67
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
In a silverware drawer

68
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,920
Hello and welcome to Planet Money

69
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
And I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

70
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,016
Today on the show The Story of Oneida

71
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:36,672
It's an iconic All-American brand and this story has got it all the charismatic founder artisanal mastery

72
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,744
Marketing genius and free love

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,144
I'm at a time when America's brand of go It Alone profit or bust capitalism is not work

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
Working for everyone it's a reminder that our country's economic history is not all Robert

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,152
Barons and Puritan people have found all kinds of ways to drive here

76
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
Let's call this one

77
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
Communal capitalist

78
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:17,120

More information is available at aecf. Org

82
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,456
In the 1840s there is a lot happening

83
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,784
It's the Industrial Revolution we are mass-producing stuff

84
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Cities

85
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,624
Working in factories it's also the time of the great awake

86
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,928
The Second Great Awakening

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,488
This is the time of religious

88
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
Zeal

89
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,560
People are starting to interpret

90
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,864
Christianity in all of these different ways

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,472
This is when the Mormons and the Adventist pop-up and the Shakers see big growth

92
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,288
And all over the Northeast these groups are getting together

93
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
They're leaving civilization

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,896
They're setting up in the woods and they're creating communist

95
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
They would make shoes or they

96
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Lakewood make chair

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,784
They would do things that people did in the Middle Ages unit

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
They would make brooms that

99
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Is very common

100
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,416
That's a doctor Tony wonderly pizan Oneida historian

101
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:17,280
And in the 1840s there are dozens of these types of communes in and around upstate

102
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,143
The Oneida Community started by a guy named John Humphrey Noyes

103
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,727
John is from a normal upper-middle-class family in Vermont

104
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,263
He's a handsome guy

105
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,103
In pictures he looks a lot like Neil Patrick Harris mph mph

106
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
And John has

107
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
Intense

108
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Charisma

109
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
With the kind of Charisma you write home about

110
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
In fact

111
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,063
More than a few young ladies did write home about it

112
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,671
Ellen Wayland Smith is a great great great grand niece of John

113
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
And she says

114
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
Here's what one woman said about

115
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,607
She said when you were in a room with him the whole room lit up and he made you want to do whatever he told you to do

116
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
John belongs to a group called The

117
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,727
Any idea behind being a perfectionist is it

118
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
You strive to make yourself

119
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
Free of sin

120
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
And desire

121
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
Are you work on your

122
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,919
So they started communism Oneida

123
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,967
But they need to find a way to make a live

124
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,295
And it first through thinking maybe Orchards

125
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,623
But the weather Upstate is very fickle and the Orchards keep dying

126
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
MN

127
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,207
Someone in the Communist tips John offices

128
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,767
There's this guy that just joined Sewell New

129
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
A legendary

130
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,119
I figured much like Davy Crockett or Daniel Boone

131
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,935
Sewell is a wildly talented artist

132
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
He makes animal traps

133
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,031
And Tony says Sewell was just like

134
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
The man

135
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,639
He's the fastest guy who's the best rapper the best shot

136
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
Sewell

137
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,759
A person like Sewell is part of what's going to make Oneida so special

138
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
The way I imagined it

139
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,599
The other communes Upstate are getting

140
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
The anxious

141
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
People in the depression

142
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,767
They're getting like if the broom makers ideally I would be a roommate

143
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,583
Baker Noel

144
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,423
John Humphrey Noyes is getting CEO.

145
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Let me think about it

146
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
Perfectionism

147
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,799
Literally means you think it is possible to be

148
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
Perfect here on Earth

149
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
So he's attracting

150
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
Talented

151
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Optimus

152
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
Catholic Soul who is a really

153
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Talented

154
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
Trap maker

155
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
He makes animal trap

156
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
By hand

157
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,647
And the timing is really good because right now forever is in the height of fashion

158
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
And everybody wants

159
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
Cops

160
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
Some collars made out of

161
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,743
Mink and ermine

162
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
And noise has these other

163
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
Talented optimistic

164
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,679
Can do followers who happened to be East machine

165
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,495
They figure out a way to mechanize production

166
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
Action of Sewells traps

167
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,311
And within a couple years

168
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
The Communist cranking out

169
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,407
200000 animal traps

170
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
These are people who

171
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:48,575
Get mass production and the roofing on the Industrial Revolution it is manufacturing but

172
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855
With a religious under

173
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:56,255
John Lewis and his followers start putting their prowess to work in other areas as well they have a bunch of side Hustle

174
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
Including

175
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
Flat where they start making flatware

176
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,143
This group just seems to have a knack

177
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:07,007
And all the things that come into the common all of the money is shared nobody owns n

178
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311
They call it Bible communist

179
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,407
And it's not like Marxist communism it literally just means communist

180
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Ism

181
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
In fact

182
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,503
They are capitalists very successful cap

183
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,623
Ellen says that meshes just fine with John's perfectionist bully

184
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
He saw it

185
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,975
Capitalism was going to be a way of uniting

186
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,279
Humans into one sort of global

187
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
Market

188
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
And that this can only bring good

189
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Infidelity bring good

190
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,775
By 1862 these people have enough money to build the 93,000 square foot mansion

191
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,615
And then 250 or so of them move in together

192
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,919
It's idyllic of men and women in

193
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Winfield's

194
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
Berries in a factory making

195
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Animal traps

196
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,855
And they only have to work a few hours a day because things are going so well they can

197
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
Can afford to hire

198
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
People in town

199
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,695
The Hangout in the Mansion library and they

200
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
They read and they put on

201
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,279
Please women take off their corsets

202
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
They cut their hair short and they start wearing

203
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,631
Pants but they are not just sharing money

204
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,215
That's the other unusual part of John's perfectionist

205
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
Society

206
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
They're sharing

207
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Spouses

208
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,591
Which is part of their perfectionism to

209
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,895
Rethink ownership and selfishness

210
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
Make people unhappy

211
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
Sockshare

212
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
John is made ground rules

213
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,039
To keep things from getting out of control

214
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
First of all

215
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
It's not called

216
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Free love

217
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
It's called

218
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Complex

219
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Marriage

220
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
You're selling

221
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:35,327
Well the rules were that all men in the community were married to all women so in other words all women and men

222
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,143
And were accessible to one another sexually and Siri

223
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,703
If a man wanted to

224
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
They called him interviews

225
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,055
Interviews interviews that was our youth Commision for

226
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Epic Sax

227
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:52,479
As a reporter

228
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
Okay so here's how it works

229
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
A man would approach a woman

230
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,671
Not the woman he wanted to interview

231
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
You better go between

232
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Net2 hurt hey

233
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
I want an interview

234
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Stacy

235
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
Can you see if she'd be up for it

236
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
And then Stacy you would get

237
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
Say yes

238
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Organelle

239
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,055
Did it work both ways I think it would have been unusual for a woman to proposition a man

240
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Damn

241
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Oh yeah

242
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
I know right

243
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,247
The Perfection is are also against what they call

244
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
Sticky love that is

245
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Selfish love

246
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
The kind of love where you get

247
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Attached to

248
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
You are never allowed to spend the night

249
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:37,279
With anyone you have had these interviews that were literally start our sessions in a room

250
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,351
Yeah you're not allowed to spend the night because that would

251
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:46,239
Nope nope well you know I get into your not sure if you have a way around it

252
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
But

253
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,615
Technically you were not you know supposed to be cohabitating with

254
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
This person you're sleeping with because that would

255
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,503
That was conducive to a kind of intimacy that would not work in the community

256
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:04,927
And if you fell in love with someone if you were like you know what John Miller is going to dude for me I don't want to see you

257
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
Severely chastised

258
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,559
Punishment took the form of mutual

259
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Criticism

260
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,911
You stand up in front of a panel of people and they would just

261
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
Tell you about yourself

262
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,543
And the criticisms could be literally anything from you know he laughs too loud

263
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,591
His stories are boring

264
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
When women get criticized for being pigeon-toed

265
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
She should try to walk with her feet

266
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
He turned out

267
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,319
So it was our way from the sublime to the ridiculous you know

268
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
To the Patty

269
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
Search me the sounds

270
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:41,279
Terrible but apparently some members of the community really liked it that even would volunteer to go in front of these panels and have people

271
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
Honestly about their

272
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Flaws

273
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,423
And for 30 years this community gets by and thrive

274
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
But then something starts

275
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
To shift

276
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
There are things going on in Oneida that are wrong

277
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,639
30 stories about John Humphrey Noyes sleeping with underage

278
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:02,015
It is very disturbing to people inside the Communist and word starts to get out

279
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,343
The same time the country is becoming more religiously cancer

280
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:10,207
The government is starting to ask a lot of questions about some of the newer religions that have cropped up

281
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Across the country

282
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:16,095
Tony wonderly says the oneidas get wins that the government is Prosecuting Mormons out

283
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,447
West and they always said when the government goes after the Mormons then we got to watch our tails

284
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
They'll be after us next

285
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,567
In 1879 John gets a tip if the authorities are coming

286
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
And he bolts to Canada

287
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
And when he leaves there are these

288
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Really big question

289
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
Do we stay here

290
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:37,599
Do we go somewhere else do we keep doing things the way we're doing or do we change

291
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,439
And so in 1880 there's a big kahmune meeting over what

292
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,999
200 people vote and

293
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
And they vote

294
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,071
To fold the Oneida

295
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
Communists are no longer going to be spouse

296
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Swapping

297
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:56,031
But even though they're not in bed together anymore they're still in business together

298
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
And it's 8

299
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
Thriving business

300
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
And they all on it

301
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,919
So they form a joint stock

302
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
Oneida Company Limited

303
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
Owned by the 200 adult commune

304
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,343
Companies worth about 14 million dollars in

305
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
In today's dollars

306
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,415
And the stock is divvied up according to how long

307
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,743
I've been with the Communists and how much Capital they put in when they arrive

308
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,815
So now these people have to change their lifestyle

309
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,655
Some of them get married and move out in for nuclear families

310
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,775
Anybody now owns their own stuff and fertilize them it really freaks them out

311
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,591
So they went through a period of time where they would take

312
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,663
Careful notice of lending one another hammer

313
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
Opinion or a nail

314
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
While they are adjusting to all of this

315
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,575
Newest who still up in Canada dies

316
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
How old are you

317
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
And then dissention set in

318
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
And a lot of the people running the company at that

319
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
That point

320
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,023
Became Advocates of spiritualism

321
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
You claim that they were in contact with

322
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
With noise

323
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,631
And noisy and decisions

324
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,703
Meaning they were talking to his ghost

325
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,823
These old guys are running a multimillion-dollar company

326
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,383
And they are getting management tips from

327
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
It's a problem

328
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,247
And meanwhile all around them the times are changing

329
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
Again we've entered the Gilded Age

330
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
Which is a time of

331
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,135
Unprecedented business competition and marketing

332
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,695
And at this moment Oneida probably

333
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Should have failed

334
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Any

335
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
What if fail

336
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Except

337
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,583
The John Humphrey Noyes had a son

338
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
Who is a very extraordinary person

339
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,471
Most of us are about as smart as we have to be

340
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
To get through life

341
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,079
And very occasionally we we meet someone who is

342
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,175
Really intelligent and when when that happens is unmistakable the

343
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,247
What person is bigger than life and Pierpont was that way

344
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,575
Pierpont noise didn't care about free love or

345
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,599
Perfectionism

346
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,647
His religion was business

347
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:52,511
He started out as a low-level flatware salesman in New York but he didn't stay there for long

348
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
The Oneida New that time to change

349
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,607
They were losing money

350
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,911
Around the year 1900

351
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,983
Pierpont comes home from New York backup to Oneida

352
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
And he and a bunch of

353
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
People from the younger generation

354
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
They take over the

355
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,199
Now Oneida is still making a bunch of different things

356
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
And Pierpont decides it

357
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
It's time to focus

358
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,111
Anything he wants to focus on is silver plated flat

359
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
Where he thinks it's the

360
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
At this time the US middle class

361
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,255
Is really growing and there all these young people who are coming in

362
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,839
Money and they have new homes and they need flatware

363
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,423
And at this time only really rich people can afford

364
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Sterling

365
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
And everybody else uses

366
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Steel

367
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,103
A new class people all want those beautiful silver Utah

368
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
Canceled but they can't really afford them

369
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
Poop your pants

370
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,527
Figures out a way to make utensils that look like sterling silver and even

371
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
Buick sterling silver

372
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Acosta

373
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Wayless

374
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,903
Pierpont takes regular metal flatware

375
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,743
And instead of dipping it in a silver bath for a second or two

376
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
He takes it and he dunks it in for

377
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
A couple seconds more

378
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,911
Does it really cost that much extra but when you pull it out

379
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,239
It looks and feels much more like the real thing

380
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
And then his idea was to

381
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
Actron these

382
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
Elaborate

383
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Curlicue pattern

384
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
And give them insane

385
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
Flowery names like

386
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Avalon

387
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Fun and coronation

388
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
End

389
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
Getting back to his salesman roots

390
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
He started knocking the competition

391
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,231
There were these old established silverware from dominated the market

392
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
The Pierpont was like a magician

393
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,583
He take his spoon and the other guy spoon

394
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:37,727
You would flashes in the customer's face he would take it you take it competition I demand you say you see this

395
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:44,127
You see this is nothing but a bunch of sausage from Tool makers

396
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,431
Heavier triple plated in silver

397
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
But people loved it

398
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Anybody

399
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,063
At the same time. Punch rippled down on a

400
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,647
He hired famous artists and in the days when most ads

401
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Just Big Blocks

402
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,975
Text Oneida comes out with all these ads

403
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
Drink the first

404
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
Pin-up girls

405
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,119
It looks like they were intelligent and having fun and wanted

406
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,959
Nothing more than to have fun with one another and to have Oneida silver

407
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
That's like what we all want

408
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
Right we all have fun and

409
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
Use utensil

410
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,127
I saw a bunch of these ads by the way it's like

411
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,199
Some hip looking young woman out on the town and then

412
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
Right below where there's

413
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,551
Just like a spoon hanging out hanging out

414
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,111
And by the mid-twenties this upstart Oneida comp

415
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,927
It was doing so well but it was buying up other silverware

416
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,023
Yes Oneida is a runaway American capitalists

417
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Success

418
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,119
But there were some things from the old communist Pierpont

419
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Kept alive

420
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
He had a motto

421
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
Nobody rich

422
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
Nobody poor

423
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
So when it came to their workers

424
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
Oneida did things

425
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
Their way

426
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,871
Pierpont called it industrial social

427
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
Oneida built its worker

428
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
Town with parks

429
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,247
Ballfield electricity water sewage

430
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
Half the salary of the school t

431
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Teachers there

432
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,599
And executive pay was kept

433
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,951
Very low and when the company was going through hard times Executives to pay cuts

434
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Before the worker

435
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,815
Nuala DeSimone the lady who I met in the mansion house Library

436
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,143
She remembers that Pierpont workers the guys on the line

437
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
Loved him so much

438
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
The one year

439
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,775
The pool their money and they bought him a blue cat

440
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
Cadillac

441
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,431
Twin up in the back remember those

442
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,503
First once and I was a beautiful car

443
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,319
I mean try to imagine in 2017

444
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
The workers of a company buying

445
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
A car for the CEO

446
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
It's unthinkable

447
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
Tony wonderly the historians

448
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
Even back then

449
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
This was extraordinary

450
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
Sf giants onesie

451
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
Are you getting choked up

452
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
What

453
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,751
I think these folks are

454
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,799
Are Inspirations for it I think they

455
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,407
Help to remind us what we should be doing as Americans what is most American

456
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
Business and our better nature

457
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
And are American

458
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,087
By the end of World War II Oneida has become

459
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
A giant it isn't

460
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
Sonic American

461
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,463
Enter pain through the big 100 year anniversary

462
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
Clown balloons

463
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Comedians

464
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Steven crown

465
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
A silver

466
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
We had Tommy Dorsey

467
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,959
Orchestra and that was pretty special have you heard of him

468
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
But the world was changing again

469
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
And this is a very familiar story in

470
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,359
Oneida has to fight to compete

471
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,151
Cheaper Imports that are coming in

472
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
Also take a start to change

473
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,271
Stainless steel becomes really popular up Silver Plate starts go

474
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,295
Going out of fashion

475
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,111
And the Oneida company starts having a lot of info

476
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Jeff noises

477
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,999
Is Pierpont noises grandson he works for Oneida for many years

478
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
Things really changed in the late

479
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,887
Sixties when the company went public when it was listed on the stock X

480
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,727
Because when that happened it wasn't a family

481
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
Anymore

482
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,079
All these Outsiders came in executive salaries Rose

483
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
The industrial socialism

484
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
Petered out

485
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
MGF noises

486
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
United name just

487
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
Wasn't what it had

488
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,039
Depreciated

489
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:07,647
The value of the name of the writer by putting it in Walmart and stuff my father

490
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
Really dislike Walmart

491
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
You didn't like

492
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
What the hell is that guy's name

493
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,047
Walton yeah well he knew Miss

494
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Scott Walton

495
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,423
Yeah cuz it was obviously they wanted an item in Walmart

496
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
And your dad did

497
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
No

498
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
Because it depreciated the name

499
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
After the break

500
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127

Shareholders

509

Services

517
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,711
Flip over a fork in a restaurant

518
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
You might see Oneida

519
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
And of course they sell it at 1

520
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
Any Oneida family still

521
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
Chicken around up there

522
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,903
And they're really proud of this

523
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,023
BC what Oneida did as an experiment in responsible

524
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
Capitalism

525
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
They made money

526
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,887
But they also took care of each other

527
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
End

528
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
