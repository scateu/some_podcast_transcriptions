And instead of closing this Memorial Day we

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,264
May 24th and 25th

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,336
The UPS Store is doing another thing altogether

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Opening

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
The UPS Store

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,176
Everything for small business

9
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,712
And of course shipping

10
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:24,576
Welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith and Robert Smith so

11
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,648
I don't know if you've heard but

12
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,464
Planet Money is a big deal

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,232
In the oil business

14
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,328
Last week we bought a hundred barrels of crude oil

15
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,400
Which works out to a little more than 4000 gallons of

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,680
Kansas wheat

17
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:45,824
Although the guy we bought it from ask for the price for Oklahoma sweet go back to episodes

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,848
If you want to hear

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,896
The most awkward negotiation in the

20
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,480
History of oil uar oil is stranded in a tank

21
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,504
In South Central Kansas

22
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,832
Because it rained and the people coming to pick up our oil

23
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,368
Could not make it on the money

24
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,416
But finally a shiny

25
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,184
Tanker truck

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,488
Holes into this muddy Road

27
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
Through a cornfield

28
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
And this guy

29
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,584
Scott Zimmerman

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,888
What do you do

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,936
How are you not covered in oil

32
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,520
You look clean the I don't see any oil on your you've been loading oil over

33
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
Well

34
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
You learn

35
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
When you first start out

36
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,152
When you go home you

37
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,200
Where moral home than U-Haul

38
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,528
And then over the years you learn how to stay clean

39
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
Part of it is

40
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,392
Rag management daubing up little bits of oil

41
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
Lot of rags

42
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,720
Scotch is the very first step

43
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,584
A long process of turning our crude oil hundred barrels of it fresh out of the ground

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
In the gasoline for your car

45
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,680
I always opened up the tank and we're going to

46
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
Open up Arlo blinds

47
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
Scott Putters around the truck

48
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:52,128
Well that what looks like a giant

49
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
Vacuum cleaner tube hooks it up to the tank

50
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
And we're going to kick our pump in an inch

51
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:09,536
Stop pulls out the oil refineries about 2 hours North

52
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,328
And so Scott could

53
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
Theoretically just drive

54
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,912
Right there and start processing Royal but

55
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
He doesn't do the

56
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
He heads in a different

57
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Scott is driving to a play

58
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,616
Because the key to the oil business is to drive as little as poss

59
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,408
Type everything you can

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
It's slower

61
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
But it is much

62
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
Pipeline leaks

63
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
Sure but

64
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,344
Oil Trucks and rail cars getting more deadly EX

65
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,184
So we meet Scott at a place that isn't even on the map

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,744
Call Dasher station on the Jayhawk

67
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,048
And it is so real looking

68
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,096
Enormous gleaming White Tanks

69
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
Long shiny pipes going off in every direction

70
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,704
One of these pipes is going to carry our oil

71
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,032
Route to the CHS refinery in McPherson

72
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
The test

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,640
Scott tells us before you put Planet Money oil in the pipeline

74
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
He has to do a quality check

75
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,736
Because it's going to mix with all the other you know

76
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Professional oil

77
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,832
Okay now we're going to get this sample right here

78
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,512
Skott porcelain little sample of Planet Money oil into a test tube

79
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,840
Any opens up this metal box attached to the side of his

80
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,912
And inside of it is something that looks like a rice cooker

81
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,728
Scott is traveling with his own Center

82
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,800
And then I put it in here and spend it out for 5 min

83
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
And what are you looking for

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
Beatrice boss

85
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
Settlement

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
And what is that dirt in Guk

87
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
Well

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,576
Just stepping oil layout

89
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,160
But it let you know whether they was good enough to buy

90
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
You got a really good VS sensor

91
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,000
There you go

92
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,560
Scott reaches in the box and flips switch

93
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
Diff oil does not pass this test then played it

94
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,056
Bunny is stuck in Kansas with 100 barrels of crappy crude

95
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
Hennessy what we got here

96
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
I am so nervous me too

97
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
See we're talkin about

98
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Probably

99
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
710 tractor

100
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
So is that good or bad

101
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,720
Oh it is

102
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
So Caleb

103
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,887
Okay so he's not blown away by our oil it's not

104
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
A+ oil

105
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
But hey

106
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
It's good enough to get us in the pipeline

107
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,263
What's it mixes with the good stuff in Owatonna

108
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
Okay Robert

109
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:34,431
Should we say anything before the oil goes into the

110
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
Vitamin E oil

111
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,551
And now Stacy

112
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
We wait

113
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,159
It is 45 miles from here to McPherson Kansas

114
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
It's going to take

115
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
All night fart well together

116
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,279
The pipeline moves very slowly only about

117
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,583
3 miles an hour you could walk faster

118
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
Turn the oil but

119
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,911
Does me we have some time to kill now so

120
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
While we're waiting

121
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,239
Hear on the radio on the podcast

122
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,103
Stacy you and Alex goldmark are going to tell us a story a legend real

123
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
About

124
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,175
The man who changed it will business forever

125
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,223
You probably never heard his name

126
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,015
But you have definitely heard of

127
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
The thing that he accidentally invented

128
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Fracking

129
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
As we know it today

130
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,279

139
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,239
This whole process the planet money has been going through of buying or

140
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,055
If there's one thing we learned on this journey

141
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,615
It is that there are a lot of steps

142
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,735
And no one knows that better than the man behind the plan are senior producer Alex

143
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
Goldmark hey Alex Stacy more steps

144
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
Along the way then I can even possibly count

145
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
I wasn't worth it

146
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
What the whole process

147
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
All along the way

148
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
Has been fundamentally changed

149
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
By one man

150
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
My full name is Nicholas steinsberger

151
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,215
I'm 52 now so 1995 would have been 31

152
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:39,871
So the oil industry is legendary for these kind of aggressive swashbuckling Tycoon Thai

153
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,527
At least in the movies there's Daniel Day-Lewis From There Will Be Blood

154
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
Milkshake there's Jer Ewing from Dallas

155
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
Nick steinsberger is not

156
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
One of those people

157
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
Nick is an engineer

158
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
Quiet guy with a big smile

159
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
Turns red really easily

160
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
His car is super tight

161
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
It still has a new car smell

162
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,935
What Nick did that change the oil business forever

163
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,519
Is invented something called slick water fracking that's basically

164
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Fracking

165
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
As we know it

166
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,663
And he showed me the spot where it all happened which is pretty much out in the middle of

167
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
So where we are between towns called of Justin and Ponder Texas which of the two small little towns in

168
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:27,487
And north of the Fort Worth area my think I'll ponder National Bank was robbed by Bonnie and Clyde back in the

169
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,327
30s I think so

170
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,655
And where we're sitting I guess

171
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Where

172
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,311
Fracking was born so where the where the modern slickwater job was

173
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Done success

174
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,639
By You By Me

175
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
Yes

176
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
Fracking is a charge

177
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
Has all of these

178
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
He's really emotional

179
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
Is there a visions of Environmental

180
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,903
Destruction earthquakes in Oklahoma stories of flammable tap water

181
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
And

182
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
There's this whole other side of

183
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,559
There's the big economic boom whole cities rising up out of the Prairie out of nowhere

184
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,863
Tens of thousands of high-paying jobs

185
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
An oil independent

186
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
It's for the US

187
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,519
All of this drama started out in the most boring possible way

188
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
Quiet engineer

189
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
Trying to save his job

190
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,383
I'm the least glamorous and

191
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
The oil business

192
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
It was 1995

193
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,783
Nick steinsberger was working for a company called Mitchell energy

194
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,367
He was 31 and he'd just gotten a big promotion

195
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
He was put in charge

196
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,719
200 oil and natural gas wells in Center

197
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
It was an area called the

198
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
The Barnett shale

199
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,351
Name for the shale rock where the gas and oil to paws

200
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,911
Were you in a suit

201
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:43,007
I think we had started to go to casual Fridays but we are still wearing

202
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
Coat and tie almost everyday

203
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Nikwax

204
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,407
This big conference room with about 10 other men

205
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,759
And he's feeling pretty good he's the youngest guy there by a lot

206
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,879
But then one of the executive starts talking about the area that Nick has just been put in charge

207
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
The Barnett shale

208
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
And the executive says

209
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
We gotta get out of it

210
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
The Barnett was failing it was not an economic Venture and we probably we're not going to be doing it much longer

211
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
So a couple of months after you got promoted here they were like we think we're probably going to shut this down

212
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,615
Little depressed

213
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:26,015
I was thinking maybe my job isn't so Security will you thought you were going to get fired

214
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,831
The wells Nick was in charge of we're losing money

215
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,135
Getting natural gas out of the shale rock

216
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
It's way too expensive

217
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
Shell rock is basically like a dried

218
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Sponge

219
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,047
He should have made out of some of the hardest rock on Earth

220
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,119
And all of those little pockets are filled with oil and natural gas

221
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,215
To get the gas Nick was drilling down a couple of miles

222
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
International Rock

223
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
And then blasting it

224
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Part with this white

225
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,639
Gel consistency of a

226
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,455
Mike Snyder like jello I'm sorry

227
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
The gel shatters the little pockets in the spine

228
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
And let this

229
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
Tiny amount of oil and gas

230
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Flow out

231
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
It's like

232
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,439
Trying to get a french fry That's Falling in between the car seats

233
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,767
Could get it but it's a lot of effort

234
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
Small reward

235
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,399
It's very colorful although I have to say If This Were Nick steinsberger scar

236
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,727
There would be no french fries no just the tidiest car in

237
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,591
Nobody wanted to put in that kind of effort on the Barnett shale

238
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,431
Exxon headquarters were just down the road from next well

239
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,015
Right on the Barnett Shale and they weren't doing anything

240
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Think about it

241
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
Gregory Zuckerman is the author of The frackers

242
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,439
You could see that headquarters of Exxon the biggest all gas

243
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
Producer in this

244
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,535
Country is literally not figuratively literally

245
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,935
On top of the Barnett Shale and yet ExxonMobil was drilling anywhere but they're lit

246
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:54,079
Federal backyard they were off sure there were an Africa there an Asia and that was because conventional wisdom at

247
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
The time

248
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
Was don't waste your time

249
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,943
Trying to get gas

250
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
From Shell

251
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
Even in your backyard

252
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
So they knew that the shell was there

253
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,391
Yeah it would do the mystery that the thing was worth

254
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Airtime

255
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
But it was worth Nick steins

256
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,559
He and his wife had a new baby and this is a rough time for the oil in

257
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,887
Layoffs were happening all over the place and Nick.

258
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
If I lose this job

259
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
I might not be able to get another

260
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,031
Silky weave the manager's meeting in Houston

261
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
He goes back to Fort Worth

262
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
And he decides that he is going to find a way

263
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
To save his job

264
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,687
Yunnan over the next

265
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,783
Dazor window at night and I was thinking

266
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
What can't what can I do

267
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:43,487
As an engineer thinks well you can become more efficient and cost-savings

268
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
Right where to trim

269
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
That chair

270
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
It was expensive

271
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,119
Made up of a ton of chemicals

272
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
Half the cost of fracking came from that Chow

273
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
The next idea

274
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,823
Just like a bar might start watering down the cocktails to stretch the liquor further

275
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
Nick started watering down

276
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
That job

277
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,479
He put in a little more water and a little less chemicals

278
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
So I'll keep on reducing the

279
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,111
Most amount of jail and Michael chemicals were pumping

280
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
Bye

281
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,951
Just making small squeaks every week or two

282
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,255
Ethnic added more water to the gel

283
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
He noticed something we

284
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,839
The wells with the water down gel

285
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
We're producing just as much Nacho

286
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,423
Gas as the wells with

287
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
Full strength gel

288
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
So

289
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Pushing the envelope

290
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
Adding a little more water

291
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
A little more water

292
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
A little more water

293
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
To do the actual Drilling

294
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,455
Nick contracts out to these big

295
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,503
Companies like Halliburton and Schlumberger

296
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
They're not fans of

297
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
Does watering down

298
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
Because

299
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
They sell

300
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,927
The gel and everytime Nick Waters it down

301
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
These companies sell

302
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,071
And so to make up for the money that they're losing from this water down gel

303
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:56,447
Nick says the company started charging him all kinds of new fees one Charger horsepower fee for the truck center

304
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,031
Equipment for putting on sights another company charge 89

305
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Yelling face

306
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
Charging more

307
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
4 using less of their product

308
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
And then one day on one of the drill sites

309
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,735
These guys say now you've done it

310
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
You hit the ceiling

311
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
Too much water in

312
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
And now the gel

313
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
It's not yelling

314
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:20,255
And it got to be so I was head reduced in by so much that they were telling me that the product they were pumping down holes

315
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,423
Just a thick watery substance it just doesn't gel it's just

316
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,543
Sugar Waterfront so I didn't pump the jello I pump the non gel jello

317
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,359
Why did you decide to Pump It Anyway

318
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
Usher

319
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
I was mad at him

320
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
But

321
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,135
Yeah we're already on that we were already so close to their already

322
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,463
Set iso estrus pump it and see what happens basically

323
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:55,071
This was definitely kind of a Swagger E oil man

324
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
I drink your milkshake moment

325
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
Watching a real job is no joke

326
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,007
Drilling a well cost almost a million dollars

327
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
And nobody

328
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
Not even Nick

329
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,151
Thought the well would work without at least a little gel to crack the Rockabye

330
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Here's the war

331
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
Conventional wisdom was that pumping too much water

332
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Into the Barnett shale

333
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
Would make the clay down there

334
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
Swell up and become a big

335
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Sliminess

336
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
Blocking all of those pockets of

337
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
Oil and gas and then nothing

338
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Would come out at all

339
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
Anixter there

340
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
Super mad

341
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
And starting to get

342
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,959
He watched the drill team pump the super watered down non gel gel

343
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
And it was like the standoff

344
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,847
Joe Mixon guys are standing there getting ready for their big

345
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
Told You So moment

346
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
Nick is standing there

347
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,479
Braced for the big i-told-you-so moment

348
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
But

349
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
It never came

350
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,087
Even with the overwater jello

351
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,647
That will produce the same amount of gas

352
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
As the gel Wells

353
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
In fact

354
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
It produced a little bit more

355
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,047
Nick had no idea why the

356
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
But standing there

357
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
He had this yurikamome

358
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
What if we just use water

359
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,239
That would cut costs by a

360
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:12,639
Fifth Third we can add just a little bleach to kill the bacteria a little soap to make the water flow more easily down the pipes

361
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
And if we did that

362
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:19,295
The Barnett Shale Wells would be profitable no question and he could keep his job

363
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
He picked a well to test his theory on

364
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
So about 20 years ago today you were driving up

365
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:37,471
As we are right now to this well to see if you are idea had works

366
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,871
The well itself looks so underwhelming I know that it goes a couple of Miles underground but all

367
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:50,271
I can see it's just this little tangle of pipes sitting on a 20 by 10 gravel plot

368
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
Surrounded by a chain-link fence with a metal sign wire to it

369
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:03,071
The name of the sign says the s h Griffin number for you're still the Mitchell energy sign on it

370
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:09,471
That was their number for named after the family that sold

371
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:15,871
Total and it was June but kind of chilly and overcast and Nicorette Before Dawn put on jeans and

372
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
Can a hard hat and work boots

373
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
Gotham coffee

374
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
And arrived at the well

375
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,855
This whole area we're sitting on the three acres Ruben full of people and equipment and and sand water

376
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Weather for

377
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,951
To do this job at that point you remember that day

378
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,999
What was it like there would have been

379
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,071
About 10 Frac pumps

380
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,423
Very big truck giant drilled thousands of feet long

381
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,751
Went down into sh Griffin number 4 and into the show

382
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:48,127
800000 gallons of Nick soapy water when he was calling slickwater were blasted into

383
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,783
And what did you see the pressure was going up and up and up and up and we're excited to the pressure valve

384
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,319
I was like the modern version of

385
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
Usher

386
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
I guess so

387
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
Nick is a reserved guy

388
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
But he told me

389
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
This was one of the biggest

390
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
Moments of his life

391
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
The gas started

392
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Flow

393
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
And Flow

394
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,935
And flow tightly enclosed in tubes of course

395
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Without any gel

396
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,031
The water had smashed the shell and created a gusher

397
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,591
NYX well-produced double what other way

398
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
Hydraulic fracturing

399
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
Fracking as we know it

400
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Was in business

401
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Right here

402
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
The world changed

403
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
I didn't know it realized the time but yes

404
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
No one could have realized

405
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
Set the time what a game

406
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
Fracking with water

407
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
Was way cheaper

408
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
It also produced

409
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
Way more natural gas

410
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,655
And they try the same technique on oil

411
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
Same result

412
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,287
20 years later the US is the largest producer of oil and natural gas

413
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
In the world

414
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Because of rat

415
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,639
Nick's boss at Mitchell energy

416
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
Became a billionaire

417
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Nick

418
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Did not

419
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
In fact

420
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,807
He didn't even get a bonus seems unfair that

421
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,855
It's your invention

422
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,439
They were better businessman than Westbrook

423
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
Are the young engineer and

424
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,095
Had no idea about the business World about

425
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,935
I was in a very small a microcosm of that industry

426
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,007
I'm also quite as pretty quiet and

427
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,799
And Reserve so

428
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
You know a lot of people are

429
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
Bill industry has a lot of

430
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
Interesting characters in the end

431
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,015
And a lot of people are very outgoing very aggressive

432
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,599
In the meantime Nick was watching the world change

433
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
Because of his invention

434
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,695
When it started out his career in the early 90s

435
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,023
Everyone was talking about how the world was running out of oil

436
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,583
How the price was going to go up and up and up and

437
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
All of the problems that was going to cost

438
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
Nick's invention

439
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,983
Meant that there were enormous reserves of oil and gas

440
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,543
Right here beneath our feet that could be cheaply

441
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,615
Gregory Zuckerman the author of The frackers

442
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175
Says it's almost impossible to overestimate

443
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
How much fracking

444
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,063
The consensus that we were running out of oil and gas this country

445
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
And we were going to be dependent

446
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,695
On nation that we really didn't want to depend on

447
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
For the future

448
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,303
And to think that it's a short number of years

449
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,119
We not only have this Surplus

450
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
Glut rashly

451
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
Exporting

452
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:24,543
Oil and gas from this country it's remarkable opens up all kinds of

453
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
Opportunities for us

454
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,663
Gregory says the whole Global power structure change

455
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,503
Saudi Arabia you're suddenly bringing in half as much money as you

456
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:40,159
You're Venezuela Rush up your whole economy is falling apart because oil prices are lower and the US is not

457
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
I find oil like a

458
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Get used to

459
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,511
If you're in the US you got lots of jobs

460
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,095
Gas is cheaper and if you're an environmentalist this is really bad

461
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,655
Just starting with the issues of drilling in

462
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,311
Fracking has been linked to earthquakes in Oklahoma flammable tap water in Kentucky Nick says he's her.

463
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
All of these things people

464
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,919
Really hate tracking

465
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
I think

466
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,991
That's

467
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:11,391
Very disturbing to me I'm I am an environmentalist I'm a Boy Scout I love camping hiking I love

468
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
Living environment

469
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,231
And I'm not and I've been on thousands of Frank jobs

470
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,791
Frankie Muniz is a

471
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839
Is misunderstood

472
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
No fracking with a k i

473
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
I just that bothers me because

474
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:28,031
Fracture stimulation does not have a K in that word but they put a K in it because it's

475
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
Quantified is also dirty word that way

476
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,919
Nick says the problems with Frac sites are overblown

477
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,967
And that fracking has really improved over the

478
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,807
But individual drill sites are not the real Environmental

479
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
Problem the real problem

480
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
Is what fracking

481
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,647
Has done to the price of

482
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
If you're an environmentalist

483
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231
You want oil to be

484
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,047
To push us into alternative fuels

485
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
When gas is cheap

486
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,679
Will drive more people buy more SUVs there's no economic incentive

487
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:00,287
To change fracking took us from a world where we thought it was just going to be more and more expensive

488
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,847
To get that last little bit of oil out of the ground

489
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,407
But now it is opened up so many

490
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
New oil field

491
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:11,807
That the Alternatives solar and wind they just don't make as much economic sense anymore

492
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Nix's

493
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
He doesn't look at it that way

494
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
Of all the potential issues or issues with it I think it creates so many benefits for our country both

495
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
Economically

496
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
The monitor jobs remote

497
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:31,008
Economic Revenue we've we've established here and

498
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,056
The security for our own country

499
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,104
Nick says he's proud to have invented

500
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,408
Is even made peace with the fact that

501
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
But he did not get rich

502
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
His invention

503
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,272
He's got his own consulting firm now

504
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,064
And a big family five kids

505
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,928
Nikki told me that if you could go back in time he would have been a little more aggressive

506
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
He would have quit Mitchell energy starting his own company

507
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,816
And grab some of the glory and money for himself

508
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,656
But as we were about to leave the oilfield Nick did something that

509
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
Totally surprised

510
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,264
He told me he really wanted to steal the sign

511
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
A metal sign

512
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,824
It was wired to the chain-link fence

513
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,640
The one that marks his first hydraulically fracked well

514
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:15,040
Sh Griffin number 4

515
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,344
I don't have any Flyers

516
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,672
Nick tells me he wants to put the sign in his living room

517
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:27,328
He tells me it's important to his soul and suddenly it's important to my

518
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:33,728
The Knick what's the time in Pennsylvania

519
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:39,360
In the end we could not get the sign off the fence

520
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:45,760
We had to leave it there

521
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
To say see the

522
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,672
Planet Money oil that you and Robert bought in a field and

523
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
That was not

524
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,816
But like every other well in this country in all the oil in America now

525
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
It was a fact

526
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
Goodbye next time

527
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:06,240
Because when fracking went big-time the amount of available oil in the US

528
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
More than double

529
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,824
Selling oil got a lot more competitive

530
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
And the price

531
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,688
That was good for us when we were buying LOL but we also have

532
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
How to sell

533
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
It'll eventually make its way to roof

534
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,856
Over the next couple episodes it'll get turned into Fuel and other products

535
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,928
But the refinery will not buy Direct

536
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
So say to you and Rob

537
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
Robert Smith called up

538
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
Else

539
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
My name is

540
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,376
Joshua way I'm with Ascent Midstream Partners

541
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,424
I'm a crude oil purchaser

542
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:40,800
So are you a middle man we always hear about the middleman my technically do

543
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,128
Take ownership of it but it's only for a fraction of a sec

544
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
Millisecond

545
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,712
Can you make a profit

546
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,504
Biotin oil for milliseconds

547
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
You can

548
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,600
Josh agreed to buy our hundred barrels of oil

549
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,416
And we were hoping to make a little profit off of

550
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
Or at least break even

551
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
So

552
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
So

553
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,560
We should probably talk

554
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
Price

555
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,168
So the price that we were looking to do for this Barrel is

556
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,728
31

557
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,776
$31.20 a barrel

558
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Okay

559
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
That feels low

560
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
We paid Jason Bruns

561
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
The guy who drill their oil

562
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
We paid him $40 a barrel

563
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Okay

564
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,512
We were starting to get the feeling that this was not

565
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
Going to go well

566
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,888
Just told us he could not give us $40 a barrel or even anything close to

567
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,448
And part of the problem was timing

568
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
Because in this market oil is bought and sold

569
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
Using a month

570
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,104
And we bought our oil it was July

571
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
29th

572
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,432
And we were using the price for July when we bought our oil from

573
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,760
But you might remember that huge storm

574
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
Blue and Kansas

575
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
And the roads got so muddy

576
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
Oil truck could not get in

577
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136
We could not sell our

578
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
And by the time the roads right out

579
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
It was August

580
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,000
And the price for oil

581
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
With much lower

582
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
So when you were trying to sell our oil to Josh

583
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,400
We were looking at a much different

584
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
So I'm going to boil this down

585
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,032
It looks like we lost $820

586
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,408
It sounds like it'll

587
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,688
So you're telling me

588
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
Jason Bruns

589
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,832
Oilman and preacher Pastor on the weekends

590
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,392
Made out like a bandit off

591
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,744
I wouldn't say he made out like a bandit

592
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
He got a good deal

593
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
We also bought him lunch

594
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,656
Now depending on how much that lunch was he got a really good deal

595
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,704
A really good deal for August

596
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
Does anyway according

597
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Josh

598
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,288
Are you saying if

599
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
It had not rain

600
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,456
And we could have gotten that oil out in July instead of August

601
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Then

602
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
We would have made it better on this

603
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,392
And that's what happens a lot of times in this industry

604
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:10,816
Robert I think we've no business in the oil business is what I think we're a little bit curved

605
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
Well

606
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,984
Also that

607
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
So

608
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:25,408
We lost $800 on our oil deal but but

609
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:31,808
Are oil is in the system next time I'll send it money we follow our oil to the refinery and see what becomes of our hundred Barrel

610
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:37,696
He's got questions about our oil or want to tell us how we could have done a better deal negotiating for it send us an email
