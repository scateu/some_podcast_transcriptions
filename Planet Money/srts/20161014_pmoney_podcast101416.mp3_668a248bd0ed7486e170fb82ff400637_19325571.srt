Michael Lewis explores the corrosion of fairness in America

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,544
And what it has done to our society mostly

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,568
Without our noticing

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,640
Listen to against the rules wherever you get your pot

7
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:23,808
Amy cop lives in Indiana and owns a white 2004 Subaru Impreza

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,088
It is not

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,112
A really nice car

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,464
It's really banged up it's almost always dirty

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,816
Even my three-year-old daughter sometimes

12
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,864
I prefer to pretend that

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,144
The other car is at

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,192
Herpes school at her car

15
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,496
What Amy really love

16
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
This car

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,312
This is the car that she drove

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,616
Through a snowstorm in Indianapolis

19
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,408
To bring her newborn daughter home from the house

20
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
Hospital

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,016
I just kept looking in the rearview mirror my wife was sitting back there

22
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,552
Baby

23
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,856
It was a really happy scene in the back

24
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,624
Seed by the

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,440
Yeah I was just full of Terror

26
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,512
The funny thing about this not-so-nice but beloved

27
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,328
Is the Amy ended up in kind of a bidding war over

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,144
About five years ago her friend Erica was selling this

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
Amy and her wife

30
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,472
I've wanted it and so did another couple

31
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
A guy in a woman

32
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,336
And anything said that couple was offering about $100

33
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
More

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,128
But Amy's friend

35
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,152
Took the hit

36
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688
She sold the Subaru to Amy

37
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,736
She just had one requirement

38
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,832
You cannot peel the Human Rights Campaign sticker off of the back window

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,416
And if you don't understand exactly what I'm saying let me let Amy

40
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,464
She sold it to us

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,256
Because you wanted to

42
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,072
Go to lick another lesbian

43
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,400
Erica wanted for Subaru to go to another lesbian couple

44
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:46,240
Part of the reason he's laughing here is that this has become kind of a stereo

45
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,776
The lesbian women love

46
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
The car even has a name

47
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,896
Erica always call it the lesburu

48
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
This is not an exit

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,992
Subaru spent more than a decade

50
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
Carefully targeting lesbian consumers

51
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,464
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Noel King and I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

That just about every other company with

54
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
Was ignoring

55
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
And how that may have helped

56
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Save the company

In the early 90s Uber was in trouble

Fielded been slumping for about 7 years

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,528
Super was competing against Giants

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
Toyota and Nissan and it was loose

74
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,648
Tim Bennett work in sales distribution for Subaru

75
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,208
Back then and him the problem was pretty clear

76
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
Subaru with having an identity

77
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,304
These were not

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
Sexy cars

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,424
Boxy reliable wagons with a certain kind of fish

80
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,240
It's granola let's 10000 Maniacs it's

81
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
Scrunchie it's hippie

82
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
It said

83
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,896
Professor in a tweed jacket 10000 maniacs

84
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
They are a great Banner creepy

85
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
But but

86
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,808
Companies want to sell to mass markets and not just

87
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
Hippies and professor

88
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,416
Subaru hired a cool Ad Agency

89
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
The ones that had come up with the just

90
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
Do it slogan for Nike

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,816
But even they could not make Subarus hip

92
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
The ad campaign went nowhere

93
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
Morale at Subaru

94
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Raises

95
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,544
And bonuses went out the window and Tim cecile's people started making all these really dark jokes

96
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
Books about how is C

97
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,592
Things got any worse

98
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,408
They were just going to have to start sending new Subarus directly to

99
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
To the scrap yard

100
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,504
If not on the winning team you're on a losing team and nobody wants to be in a loser

101
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
And if that would have felt like at this time

102
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,416
But the company realized one type of Subaru was actually selling pretty well

103
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:17,536
These are cars with all-wheel drive the kind of cars that are popular in places with bad weather

104
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
Super said

105
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
Alright let's start there with

106
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
The bright spot

107
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,679
Let's meet the people who are buying these cars

108
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
The Ransom Focus Group

109
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
And they identified four categories of

110
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
The people who are buying

111
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,639
The first category they called the rugged individualist basically the

112
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
Outdoorsy types

113
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
So those are the people kayakers mountain biker scares

114
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
There were technical professional

115
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
Technical professionals

116
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
Engineers

117
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
I'm educators

118
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
Teachers

119
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
Teachers

120
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,511
Healthcare professionals

121
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
Have to get to the ER all kinds of weather.

122
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,631
Show me some random assortment of

123
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Professions here

124
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
But within those

125
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
There was a Common Thread

126
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Women

127
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
A lot of Subaru owners

128
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Women

129
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
In a lot of cases

130
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,383
They were women who identified themselves as

131
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Head of house

132
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,735
Tim Mahoney was running marketing for Subaru at

133
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
The time and one day he was watching

134
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
A focus group in

135
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
San Francisco behind it

136
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Two-way mirror

137
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
One of the guys

138
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,487
Who actually work for our research company who happened actually be gay

139
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,535
He says yeah all my friends

140
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
Turn on supers are lesbians

141
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,423
It was like one of those moments where everything came into Focus

142
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:33,311
Tim Mahoney realize he may have just discovered a fifth group who love Subarus

143
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Lesbian

144
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
Subaru have to figure out too thin

145
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Number one

146
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,735
Is this true or is it just anecdotal

147
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,551
Is actually a significant consumer group

148
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
For Subaru

149
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
Even if it was

150
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,623
How are they going to mark

151
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
Kathy's Kars

152
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
Super got in touch with Mariah now

153
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,535
So the tiny Ad Agency based in Manhattan

154
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,119
With specialized in marketing to Gay and Lesbian consumers

155
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
John Nash was the creative director

156
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
What was the first campaign you worked on

157
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Waze download

158
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,847
Dial a match 1-800 Mattress

159
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,431
Names John and his business partner Ryan we're both openly gay

160
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:16,831
And they would go to these big companies and they would pitch them they would say look gay and lesbian consumers are a big

161
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,647
Deal they have money and we know how to talk to

162
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Tire us

163
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
To design new ads

164
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
So with dial Mattress

165
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
Did these Billboards and beautiful

166
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
Photography of a guy like like

167
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,679
It was all very already a guy laying on his stomach but you can see you know he had to

168
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,007
Close but he had to she pulled down

169
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
Who you sleep with

170
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
Yeah here it is

171
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
Who you sleep with is your business how you sleep

172
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Thesaurus

173
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
Dial matricide

174
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
It was a tough sell

175
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,015
This was the early 90s it was during the AIDS crisis

176
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,599
And a lot of companies would not talk directly to gay and lesbian

177
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
Consumers

178
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,183
Because they were afraid of alienating heterosexual

179
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
Is that John says

180
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,767
A lot of the companies that did

181
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,607
Advertise to gays and lesbians what he calls the sin Industries

182
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
It's like booze and cigarettes

183
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,959
And then out of the blue comes as call from Subaru

184
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,031
Sing hey we think lesbians might be one of our most

185
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
Markets and we need to confirm

186
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,639
So John and his colleagues went out to Northampton Mass

187
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
Subaru's research said

188
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
A lot of its cars were being sold

189
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,343
And they gathered a little group of local Subaru owners together into a room with one of those two-way mirrors

190
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,231
So we get up there where in the door in the observation room which always has like M&Ms and crackers is a very Danger

191
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
Nearest place to date especially if you are on

192
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
Any kind of a diet so there's

193
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
All that

194
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
Candy and then the women start coming in

195
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
But only when

196
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
Yeah that's amazing

197
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
Both groups were 100% fee

198
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,055
100% there were no men

199
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,151
John watches the women from the other side of the mirror while a researcher asks

200
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
What do you use your car for

201
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
I want to move my dog from here to here

202
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,135
I like throwing my stuff in the back and going camping and there's a tone and and there's a tone to how they were answer

203
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,695
That was different than a woman saying

204
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,511
I like to go to TJ Maxx and get my hair done

205
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Wow

206
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
Okay parently

207
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:08,191
Two kinds of women in the world I know I know I know I know and John said as a human being

208
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,543
He hates this kind of stereotyping but as an ad guy

209
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,591
This is sort of what you do

210
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,383
You break people up into categories

211
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
You say broadly here's what they're like

212
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
And then you try to sell stuff to him

213
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,831
So this is exactly what he's doing he's looking at these women and he says to himself

214
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
I think they are part of a specific group

215
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
And like these are lesbians or talk

216
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
Be there lesbian

217
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,487
Okay not just that

218
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,279
These women seem to

219
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
Do love their Subaru

220
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,399
So John and the Ad Agency drive down to Cherry Hill New Jersey

221
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
Where Subaru is headquartered

222
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
2 pitch

223
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,751
The company this was not

224
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
A small

225
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
I think a lot of us forget

226
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
But the early 90s were not

227
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
Particularly

228
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,943
Progressive time right

229
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
This is the era of don't ask don't tell

230
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:59,647
In just a couple years Bill Clinton was going to sign the Defense of Marriage Act which would effectively say same-sex Partners cannot be

231
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Considered spouses

232
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,023
And even inside Subaru being openly gay was not easy

233
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,399
Tim Bennett the guy who saw Subaru having an identity crisis he later worked on this campaign

234
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
Tim is gay

235
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,239
And he never came out at Super because

236
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
He saw what

237
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
What could happen if

238
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
There was a out

239
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,175
Gentleman who was gay in the Mailroom they were people in the office that didn't want him to deliver mail

240
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
To their deaths because they're afraid they're going to get a hit

241
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
So this is the environment

242
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,575
I know a lot of people thinking of the campaign notes

243
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
What happened

244
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
So here comes Mariah and Nash

245
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,719
Into this conference room with about 20 Subaru bigwigs

246
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
John and the team start a PowerPoint presentation

247
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Here is we are

248
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
Here is what we were doing in Northampton

249
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
And then

250
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
And then it was time for the bombshell basically in and that's it I think that was like 6 or 7 panels into this PowerPoint

251
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
Thing you know you've

252
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
You click the button up Pops this thing you know the

253
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,199
Target consumer in Northampton is a lesbian

254
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
John is braced for resist

255
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
We have to remember his agency

256
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
He had been going to

257
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Years with

258
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,903
Number statistics data sing look

259
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,999
Gay and lesbian consumers are very important you need to start marketing today

260
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
Look at the numbers

261
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,583
And companies have been looking at this and saying

262
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
You're very interesting but

263
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
No thanks

264
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
And now here he is pitching to a car

265
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,519
Which is like the definition of mainstream

266
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
Annie's telling him

267
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
You got to Market your car so lesbian

268
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:28,991
In the middle of the pitch John keeps sneaking these glances at the president of the company trying to figure out what he say

269
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
He just kind of dogs

270
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,623
Sydney Sydney crosses his arms and you know you always learn in business that when pee

271
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
People cross their arms

272
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
They're closing themselves off

273
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,791
Do you or something crazy like that like we at that's where you always have to be careful cocktail party.

274
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
Pressure arm

275
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,399
Other people around the table are also looking at the president of Subaru wondering

276
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
Do what

277
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Going to say

278
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,751
But he doesn't do or say anything

279
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
He just keeps watching

280
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:57,663
Pitch so they finish the presentation and then I don't need to invent a group to speak to

281
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,223
It looks like you found a group of people we can already talk

282
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
He said so this looks like a good thing

283
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
He didn't forget

284
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,343
Not only did he not freak out

285
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
She hired

286
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,927
Remember this is a car company

287
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
This is what every Ad Agency

288
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:17,119
And now this tiny little ad firm has been hired to create ads for Gay and Lesbian consumers

289
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
4 super

290
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
Now of course they had to get down to designing

291
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
The actual ads

292
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,055
Johnson's this proved to be a little bit

293
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,407
Remember they were breaking new ground here and so John had to find ads

294
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,503
It would fit both of the image that Subaru had been cultivating for years and years

295
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
And

296
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
With this new group of consumers

297
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Find a Target

298
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,903
That's right in fact John showed me the first print ad

299
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
That he did in 1995

300
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,767
Until what it is is there's a Subaru up at the top

301
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
Bright and there's

302
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,607
Two women down at the bottom and the headline is

303
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
It loves camping

304
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
Dogs and long-term commitment

305
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Too bad

306
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
It's only a car

307
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,847
Good right it's good good and then down at the bottom there's a pig

308
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Picture of two women

309
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,919
When the ad first went to be executives

310
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
The two women were together

311
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,527
The executive see this and they tell John listen listen

312
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,343
Separate them please put some copy in between them

313
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,135
Can opposite corners of

314
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
Looking at each other

315
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
Looking looking over the tech

316
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
What can I do with a text at

317
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Each other

318
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
Miss Johnson's the kind of settled into a

319
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,959
Were they would use references that were obvious to Gay and Lesbian consumers

320
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
But not really to anybody yet

321
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,055
And at the time there was

322
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
Xena Warrior Princess

323
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
Was the show that was airing like on

324
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,223
The WB Network or something and the lesbians love

325
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
Lucy Lawless

326
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
And everybody loves Dean

327
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,647
So one of the license place is going to be Xena lover Xena lvr

328
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
One of them was ptownie

329
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
P dash townie

330
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
Provincetown another one was a camp

331
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
Out

332
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
It was so settled the message was there

333
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,959
But you would have to look at the license plate on the car

334
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
In the picture in the print

335
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
To get it

336
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
John was in San Francisco when the ACT

337
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
Campaign launched she was at a bus

338
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,431
Stop any bus pulled up to the stop with his add on it

339
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,503
Immediately looked everybody standing there at punch old ladies look at

340
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
The car is done to a saying

341
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,599
Two gay guys and believe me I knew they were gay gaydar

342
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
Finely tuned

343
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,207
They both look at each other and just kind of smile like they got it

344
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Yeah they got it

345
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,303
In about 2 years after this campaign started

346
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,351
Subaru sales started growing

347
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
The niche marketing was working

348
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:31,007
From those groups that Subaru had identified the outdoorsy types of nurses and engineers

349
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
Subaru head marketing to Olive

350
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
Edit sales were going up

351
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
And then

352
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,479
In 2000 Subaru made a bold move aimed right at lesbian consumers

353
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
Martina

354
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
Navratilova

355
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,599
Subaru hired the retired tennis star who is

356
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,927
One of the most high-profile lesbians in the world at that

357
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
To do this

358
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
Big at camp

359
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:57,887
How do I know about the foreman I know about control

360
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,727
Who do I know everything

361
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,823
She nose everything

362
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,151
Pam derderian was responsible for this campaign

363
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
She runs a marketing firm called 15 minutes ink and she introduced Martina Navratilova to the people at Subaru

364
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
In the 90s

365
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
And she says

366
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
This was the moment

367
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,951
When Subarus Niche marketing campaign be

368
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
Became not-so-nice

369
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,303
She was on mainstream television commercials

370
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
Promoting the car

371
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
She was in

372
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
Print ads promoting the car

373
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,191
She was an outdoor

374
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
Billboard advert

375
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Advertising promoting

376
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
The cars

377
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
She was in Maine

378
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Stream

379
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Advertise

380
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
Not that there wasn't some push

381
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
Super good always faced resistance from some of its

382
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
Steelers who had problems

383
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Sprint ads

384
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,087
But when ads started to hit TV the campaign got a lot more

385
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
This wasn't just

386
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
Xena on a license

387
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
These were really high-profile ads

388
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,743
John Nash said they were angry letters

389
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
Gears of a boycott

390
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,095
It's anxiety-inducing only because you don't want to lose money

391
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Your favorite client

392
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
Over something if

393
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
Completely out of

394
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,007
If the business marched away was going to be because someone

395
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
Wrote a letter in crayon

396
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,871
I'm saying you know how dare you sell cars to be

397
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
These dirty gay p

398
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
Subaru didn't March away

399
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
They kept up the camp

400
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,063
A year after they hired Martina Navratilova they had their best

401
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Sales year

402
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,927
Eminem 2004 there was this big opportunity for

403
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Product

404
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Placement

405
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,255
There was a show on Showtime called

406
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
The L Word

407
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,375
And Pam derderian helped create a storyline on The L Word

408
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
Where lesbian tennis player

409
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
Got an endorsement deal with soup

410
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,335
Subaru

411
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:47,967
So a Subaru supposed to get her some kind of charity event to support the Arts

412
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
Public School

413
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,295
How hot is that

414
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
Pam derderian says

415
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Olive

416
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
Was a really big deal

417
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
All of this was a watershed

418
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
I kept using the term nice

419
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,815
Marketing and she kept shutting me down and saying

420
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,631
Subaru went so far beyond nice mark

421
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
We're more comfortable

422
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
Who would ever think that an ABS

423
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:14,335
AC program Modern Family two weeks ago would have a 9 or 8 year old trans

424
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Gendered character

425
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
On this is not niche

426
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Any longer

427
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
This is just being out

428
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
And proud

429
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
And owning who you

430
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,575
You are and living in a diverse

431
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
Inclusive

432
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Society

433
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
By about

434
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
2006

435
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,743
Subaru had grown into a very steady

436
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Success

437
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,815
It wasn't Toyota wasn't Ford

438
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,631
But it's numbers were going up and when the recession hits

439
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Super Wings

440
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
The only car company in the US

441
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
Not to lose Market

442
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,287
But in spite of the success Subaru

443
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Seems to kind of

444
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Change direction

445
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
I mean if you look at their ads now there's

446
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,687
New Martina Navratilova know Xena

447
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
Instead most of the ads

448
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,063
Speech Europe heterosexual an outdoorsy couples on their way to hike

449
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
And things like that

450
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,927
And the moment when our societies become so much more inclusive

451
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
It's strange

452
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
Why did Subaru back off

453
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,863
Yeah I was really curious about this so I called Subaru and I asked a spokesman

454
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:14,751
Any City troop we don't directly Target gay and lesbian consumers anymore our ad campaigns.

455
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
These days focus on Ark

456
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Customers Hobby

457
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
Decent interest

458
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
Lake mountain biking and kayaking

459
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
Pamper Darien has a theory about

460
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,479
She says since the 90s when this started

461
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,551
So many more people are just living out

462
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,647
And what was Niche is now just much more mainstream

463
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
Sony's marketing is

464
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
Kind of passe

465
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,047
Brightwok Niche marketing became a victim of its own success

466
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
Of course that raises the

467
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
The question

468
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
Do ad campaign

469
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Actually

470
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Influence the

471
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
Or do they just

472
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Reflective culture

473
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:50,847
Yeah I kept asking myself that question and the answer is I honestly don't know

474
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,479
I put that question to Amy the woman from the beginning of the show who owns a Subaru and loves the Subaru

475
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,783
She said honestly she does not know

476
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,319
But then she told me this

477
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Amy Wendt

478
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
To college in small-town

479
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
In a place that

480
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Was not especially friends

481
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
She did not have an easy time

482
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
And then after school she moved to Washington D

483
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,655
And one day she's in Dupont Circle and she's

484
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
Cease this Superbad

485
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,263
And I remember seeing this ad on the bus stop that said

486
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
It's not a choice it's the way were born

487
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,103
And it made me smile

488
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,919
It made her smile because it was talking to her

489
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,199
It's not a choice

490
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
It's the way we roll

491
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,783
She knew exactly what that ad was saying

492
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
And not everyone would have known

493
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Exactly what that ad was

494
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
It was an inside joke

495
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
