Just a heads up there is

18
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,472
One bad word in this episode

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,520
But it comes up a lot

20
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,824
It's the f word and as you'll hear

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,104
We just can't avoid it

22
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,384
And actually there's

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
A couple other bad words in here

24
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,016
Jen Lewis was a doodler

25
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,088
Never been the class clown I was really quiet in school

26
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,112
This is the most of it

27
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,696
She has the type of humor that sneaks up on you

28
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,232
Would you say that your

29
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,768
A comedian

30
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,584
No I guess

31
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,400
I would call myself like an internet

32
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
Humorous

33
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:16,544
But I have imposter syndrome so I've never said that turn before until right now she gets paid

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,616
To make funny things on the internet for companies like net

35
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
Netflix Embassy

36
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,968
One of Jen's first viral hits came in 2015

37
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,296
Kanye West and Kim Kardashian were at the Grammys

38
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,832
There's a picture of them kissing

39
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,136
And Jen decides to have a little fun with

40
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:36,768
I photoshopped Kanye's head on to Kim's body replace Kim's hands of Kanye's hands

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,608
Just like Kanye's hands on Kanye's face on

42
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,912
Yeah Kanye's hand on Kanye's butt

43
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
Kanye's hands on

44
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,984
Kanye shoulder

45
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,568
And a warm embrace and 11

46
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
Loving

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
It's Kanye

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Kissing

49
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,480
Kanye and it looks extremely realistic

50
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Jen

51
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,624
Put into a picture with the world in 2015 already had an inkling about

52
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
That no one loves Kanye West

53
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,208
More than Kanye West

54
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:10,560
She posted it on Twitter and the next day the picture was everywhere

55
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
All over the internet

56
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,912
It ended up spray painted on a giant wall and Australia

57
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:20,288
Eventually Kanye West even comes out with this song which seems like it could be describing Jen's picture

58
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,872
We still love Kanye and I love you like Kanye

59
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,200
Loves Kanye I maybe had part of it

60
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Except

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,296
Wenjun tweeted her picture out the day after the Grammys

62
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
She only got 221 likes

63
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,416
Her picture went viral because this

64
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,720
Hugely popular Instagram account

65
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
Shared her picture on his page

66
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,816
You might have heard of this account it's called

67
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
F word

68
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
Jerry like

And it has millions of followers

72
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,360
Fun Jerry share Jen's picture the day after she made it and he wrote that Kanye kissing Kanye looked

73
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
Absolutely

74
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Terrifying

75
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
And he's supposed

76
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:03,040
Got a hundred and forty thousand like Switchback then mint it went viral

77
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
So like inflation turn

78
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
Yeah

79
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Pretty good

80
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,560
I know this viral picture could have been a giant advertisement

81
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,096
For Jen and her career

82
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
But

83
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,936
No one knows she made this did they credit you

84
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
No

85
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,312
It sucks because then you know

86
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,432
People don't know that it came from you and that was my that was my joke that was my idea

87
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
Jen says she asked

88
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,040
Both Jerry to creditor but that no one responded

89
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Empty bothered her at first

90
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,672
But she got over it until Jen found out that f

91
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
Jerry

92
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,048
Could make as much as $30,000 for posting a single add-on his

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,168
I don't care if someone just posting my jokes because they think they're funny and they want their followers to see

94
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
But if they put a price tag on those eyes

95
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:58,336
I think you should be paying them what felt annoying to Jen in 2015

96
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Now felt

97
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896

98
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664

Other people have been stealing them

104
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,119
The internet has made taking jokes easier and more lucrative than ever before

105
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,263

Meg Wright covers comedy for the entertainment website vulture

00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791

Gems of the internet started crumbling like

174
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:04,447
Okay these brands are reaching out to F Jerry because he's popular

175
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
But

176
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
He's only popular because he's been sharing

177
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
Our funny things

178
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,943
And in the comedy world that kind of thing on attributed that could be considered a joke.

179
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,527
And then Comedy Central started advertising on F Jerry

180
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
And that's one that goes like

181
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,367
Comedy Central should know better

182
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
They are the home for comedians

183
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,767

Without their permission or

186
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,423
Four years without crediting it just didn't feel like

187
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
Comedycentral should

188
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
Align themselves

189
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:44,895
With a place like that Meg decided it was time to unite all the aggrieved people like Jen

190
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
And start

191
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
In Internet

192
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,271
War every follower is

193
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
Let's say a dollar

194
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
Could we

195
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:57,439
Take $10,000 from them could we take $100,000 from them

196
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
Is on a mission

197
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,279
To take add money away from the alleged joke thieves

198
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
And give it back

199
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
To the comedians

200
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Or something like that

201
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
We're watching all this wandering

202
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,703
Can you really

203
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,239
Own a joke

204
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
Suikoden expert

205
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
When do you think

206
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
The first active

207
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,895
Joke thievery was committed

208
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
In the Neolithic era

209
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:26,111
Chris Brigman wrote the paper on joke theft he's an intellectual property lawyer and professor at NYU

210
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,183
But he's a cool IP lawyer he also studies

211
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
Is fashion and

212
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,791
P*** my mom was completely confused by my career

213
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
Let's put it that

214
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
Mom don't come in here doing work

215
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Anyway

216
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,775
Chris says if we want to answer whether you can own a joke and what stealing a joke even means

217
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,591
We have to understand how comedy itself

218
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Is changed over time

219
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,735
We're taking this way back

220
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
2 Vaudeville

221
00:08:54,783 --> 00:09:00,927
Slap sticky variety shows from the 1800s they are magicians elephants acrobats and a funny is

222
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
HMC that you've

223
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:07,071
Could consider a comedian you wouldn't recognize thermostat as a stand-up comedian

224
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
Is there an MC there they're different

225
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,727
Vaudeville collapsed after World War II because of more exciting things like movies and radio

226
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,543
Does funny ish MCS add to go off on their own

227
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
Went solo

228
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,895
By the 1950s this is

229
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:27,295
You're growing into kind of the first wave of what we would recognize now a stand-up comedians the post Vaudeville

230
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
One liner

231
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Chokeslam

232
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Joke

233
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
They tell joke

234
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
After joke

235
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,327
After joke

236
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
Going to be here tonight even at this salary

237
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
Not really

238
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:48,287
Sophisticated jokes no one is putting a whole lot of effort into them so no one really cared if you.

239
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,151
Took them it isn't until the 1960s that comedian start caring more about the tech

240
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
Putting more work

241
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
Into each joke

242
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
Comedians at more of a Persona now

243
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,575
Writing in a way that is meant for only them to pull off

244
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
Take Mitch Hedberg

245
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
Please

246
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
I don't have a girlfriend

247
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,255
I just know a girl who would get really mad if she heard me say that

248
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,375
Stand-up comedy explodes in the eighties and nineties

249
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,471
Comedians like Dave Chappelle and Katt Williams now have sets that are

250
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
Longer more intricate

251
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
Sesame Street teaches kids

252
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
How to judge people

253
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
Black Hawk Down your name Oscar

254
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
I treat this guy like s***

255
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
The entire show

256
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:33,599
Play Josh I'm writing this fake Oscar you are so mean

257
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
Yeah

258
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
You're a grouch

259
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,959
You got jokes that

260
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
There's more investment in

261
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,799
And therefore there's a felt need for sump

262
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
Protection of them

263
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
Right so they can't just be stolen and used

264
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:02,527
White people are friendly you can call that motherfukers up at 3 in the morning with the wrong number and they won't even be mad at you

265
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,831
Hello

266
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,391
No I'm sorry no Shaquita here

267
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:13,791
Phone number did you dial

268
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,631
Will try it if it doesn't work call me back

269
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,727
Now jokes are intellectual property

270
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
But intellectual property laws

271
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
Don't

272
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
Really protect jokes that well there are a lot

273
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
A barriers

274
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,735
It cost $35 to register a joke with the copyright office

275
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,039
But you can't copyright a joke that's too short

276
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,343
And you can't copyright ideas

277
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,415
Copyright only protects the specific wording of it

278
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
And because of that all it takes to steal one

279
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
Is to slightly rewrite the joke

280
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,839
And all of these rules are here

281
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
In a weird way

282
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
To keep the jokes

283
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,239
Flowing so that comedians don't get sued for saying something like

284
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
Don't you hate it when

285
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:02,175
You get sued for using a phrase that should be in the public domain and then we the economy consumers lose out now

286
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
No one wants to risk

287
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Making jokes

288
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
And on top of all of that

289
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,599
It's really expensive to defend a joke with copyright

290
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
It's federal law

291
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
Fancy lawyers

292
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Foremost comedians

293
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
It's just not worth

294
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:20,095
Chris says no stand up comedian has ever filed a copyright lawsuit

295
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,887
Against another stand-up can

296
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,191
You actually looked for

297
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
We look

298
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
We found none

299
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Secret things

300
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,591
If comedians aren't using IP law

301
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,407
There must be something else keeping joke. In check

302
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:39,807
Duchess deep in the mystery like what are they doing are they just standing there tolerating jokes after is there something else operating

303
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
I'm here that we haven't yet understood

304
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
So Crystal

305
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
Old Holland comedian

306
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
And he finds out that

307
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,535
The comedy world has created this whole informal system

308
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
Extinction

309
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
That has kept joke theft

310
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
At a tolerable level

311
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
And

312
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
We could have Chris

313
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
VIP lyrics

314
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
Explain the system of sanctions but

315
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,079
Why would we do that when we could have a real life

316
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
Stand up comedian do it

317
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
Planet Money listeners

318
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
Jim mendrinos

319
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
There's an old fashioned on the air sign

320
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
That is the most awesome thing I've ever

321
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,855
Ever seen a molecular does it's not real

322
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
We're not on the air

323
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,255
Jim's been doing stand-up for 35 years

324
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,351
He says the most bare-knuckle way that comedians prevent joke theft

325
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Is

326
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
With violin

327
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,495
This is actually a real thing showing that Christy IP

328
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,055
P lawyer found in his big report

329
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,359
You know break some joke Thief

330
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
Car

331
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
Removed his bumper with a crowbar

332
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,551
And I'm there like every time I hear you do one of my jokes I'm going to break something on your

333
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
So yeah

334
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
You protect what's yours

335
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183
Also comedians created

336
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,487
An early warning system to combat

337
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,327
When there is somebody was no joke thief in the room

338
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,167
I'll write a note on the napkin send the waitress up with a drink for the comic

339
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,983
So that they don't do something that's precious to the

340
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,543
It's all about your reputation

341
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
I mean the whole reason why

342
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,455
You know to send up a note to another comic when somebody walks in the room is from reputation

343
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:16,319
Back in 2002 Jim mendrinos was at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York City

344
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
Another comedian a friend of his

345
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
What is in the middle of the set

346
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
And Jim starts writing

347
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
The note

348
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
And he's talking the waitress comes up

349
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:29,375
Hands of the drink that Robin Williams is in the back watching

350
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
No oh yeah

351
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
Absolutely

352
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,055
I don't think I'm talking to you love the dead but Robin Williams had a tremendous

353
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,871
Reputation for being a joke Thief

354
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,687
Stolid borrowed a joke

355
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,991
The stove store

356
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,295
What something accidentally tok do you know

357
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,367
Is the genie I have attachment issues

358
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,695
The comedian walked off the stage right after he got Jim's note

359
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
Said Thank you and goodnight

360
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,071
Robin Williams did talk about his reputation for being a joke Thief

361
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,399
He said he just kind of soaked up funny things inadvertently

362
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,727
And Jim says Robin Williams actually copied from him

363
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,799
Oh yeah and he's a brilliant mind and you know what

364
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,359
I hate to put it this way but

365
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Did the job better than I am

366
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
Which is the frustrating part of it

367
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,015
Robin Williams also figured out a way to

368
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
To smooth things over

369
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:24,159
And then when I called him out on it. He just had his manager cut me a check

370
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
ELC

371
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Kind of light bulbs

372
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,303
Never said starve stealing it is sorry for the inconvenience

373
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,351
How much was the check for

374
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
Which back then was a

375
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
Lots of money

376
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
Remember what the joke was that

377
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
Keystone

Yeah I didn't know that was there was a few 8-balls ago

382
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
That's not good at speed really

383
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,599
Jim says reputation is the currency of the comedy world

384
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
If you get the reputation of being a joke thief the comedy world gets together and imposes a good old-fashioned

385
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
Public

386
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Shaming

387
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,375
Comedians refuse to do shows with you Comedy Club stop booking you

388
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,727
So when internet humorous realize that it's hard to lock up their jokes

389
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
What IP law

390
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:15,359
They turn to the sanctions created by their comedic for fathers and mothers

391
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,175

F words

400
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,511
If no one is going to police them

401
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
And they're allowed to

402
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
Constantly

403
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
Steal other people's work and profit from it

404
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935

I don't have a

481
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,087
You don't have a title I guess I could say you know

00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Featheriffic Jerry

483
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,951
And then what does the founder effect Jerry do

484
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Various things

485
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:51,167
Like like with Elliot dabeli is the kind of person who just says he does

486
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
Various things

487
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
Spray living

488
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
Period doesn't elaborate

489
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
He's kind of quiet

490
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Looks nervous and

491
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
Seems like you just kind of

492
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
Stumbled into this whole thing

493
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,015
I started seeing what I was 20 years old not knowing what the heck I was doing

494
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,831
Draymond think twice about like

495
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
You know

496
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,439
Posting content on the internet and I was just

497
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
Came from a very innocent place

498
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,023
But at a certain point

499
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,815
You know I did notice that

500
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,447
If it 10 shalie could be become something Elliott has actually built his following into many

501
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,311
He created a company that does video ads social media documentaries

502
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,127
You may have heard about the ill-fated fyre Festival

503
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
They help promote it

504
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
The bring in millions of dollars

505
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
Elliott also launched

506
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,343
Board game based on popular memes and he's the part-owner of the tequila come

507
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,183
Anne Elliot does not consider sharing other people's memes

508
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
He says

509
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:50,303
He's a curator and there are a lot of curators on the internet

510
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
Also he did

511
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
Start crediting some people a couple years

512
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,031
But after the FF Jerry campaign Brands like comedycentral and Bumble pulled their ads

513
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,847
And 300000 people unfollowed after

514
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,455
I walk down the street and I feel like people are looking at me like I'm up

515
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,271
Yeah go to a soft fraudster

516
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,599
Thai person with reality I know I'm not at all

517
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
And just like that hole

518
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,464
Misconception of who I am as a person from all this is

519
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
What sucks the most to me

520
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
Me personally

521
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
My reputation

522
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
Did this make you sad

523
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
You don't know

524
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,896
Oh you look sad

525
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Oh yeah

526
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,528
Actually did think

527
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
Truly upset about this campaign

528
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,904
And to maybe take his side for just a moment

529
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,208
When Elliot started doing all of this

530
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,792
The rules around crediting we're kind of unclear

531
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,864
But it is hard to be too sympathetic

532
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,912
Elliott has done some

533
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,728
Edgy things with other people's content like

534
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,288
For a while Elliott was using other

535
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,848
People's funny posts about their drunken nights

536
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,896
To advertise his

537
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
Tequila like

538
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,480
Screenshotting some other person's funny post

539
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,296
And then slipping his brand into the caption

540
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,112
Without even asking them if they liked his tequila

541
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,744
So I mean you could call it an dad and the sense but I did I don't see that as an ad but I

542
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,536
I see how baby that's gray and weave

543
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,096
You know where stop

544
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,144
You are not no longer doing that so

545
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,496
Are you genuinely like you didn't think that it was an ad

546
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,312
I don't consider that an ad now

547
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,152
Elliot says he has been evolving with social media now

548
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,992
Because of the whole everyone unfollow freak Jerry campaign

549
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,808
He's asking people for permission to post their material

550
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,880
But Meg Wright who started the whole campaign

551
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,208
And a bunch of other internet humorous and funny people

552
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
Say that's still not enough

553
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,792
But to the people who stay

554
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,840
Well why not paper

555
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
People for your car

556
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,192
Like your share at your crediting them you're asking for consent now

557
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,496
But why not just like writing a check

558
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:13,920
It's a media I guess it's you could call it a media company I mean you guys pay me for this interview no

559
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Not allowed to

560
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
So is it

561
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
Should we say

562
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,600
That like paying people for a content is not something that you are currently

563
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,648
Planning or I mean

564
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
You kind of just give like a

565
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
I don't really know how to characterize what you said

566
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
I mean it's not no

567
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
That's for sure

568
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,656
Like like we keep saying this is like an ever-evolving thing

569
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,448
For now we have

570
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
Consent policy policy in place

571
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,312
Next week it might be you no payment

572
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
Who knows

573
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,664
Elliot is considering paying people

574
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,968
Which is a big deal to go on the record

575
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,784
Because it would mean changing his whole business

576
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
And if they did do it

577
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,112
What would that mean how would that look

578
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,440
They go back and pay everyone since 2011

579
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
Does he only pay the new meemers

580
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,792
And totally forget about all the gens that got him there

581
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,840
And wouldn't even be enough for the internet

582
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,656
What is the fair price for a good meme

583
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,960
And we should point out that a lot of Brands and

584
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,776
Count and people do what Elliot does

585
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
News sites

586
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
Aggregate funny

587
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:20,992
Facebook Tumblr Instagram it selfies are all platforms that are profiting off of our free

588
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,296
Voluntarily uploaded pictures

589
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:28,160
This fight is ultimately about something much bigger than F Jerry and Elliot to ballet

590
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,464
It's about who on the internet

591
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,792
Profits from all the funny pretty gross weird

592
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,864
Interesting things we upload everyday

593
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,168
Maybe everyone should be paid

594
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,960
For everything we post

595
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
