This episode originally aired in 2014

13
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,320
I went to the gym the other morning a planet

14
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
Fitness

15
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,136
And if you've never been to a Planet Fitness

16
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,184
It's one of the cheapest gyms around

17
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,976
It's like $10 a month

18
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,024
While I was there by said the sky

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,816
He was sitting in a massage chair

20
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,352
Fitness has massage chairs

21
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
Jaquan voice

22
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,192
He and his friend had just finished working out

23
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,240
He told me they were working on their arms

24
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,032
How often do guys come

25
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,824
5 days a week.

26
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
Yeah

27
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,408
That's Monday to Friday cuz I work in a city

28
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,944
Flock of Seagulls

29
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,760
But to be honest while I was looking at him

30
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,856
Wasn't totally convinced that Jaquan actually comes to the gym 5 days a week

31
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,136
So I asked him

32
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,976
Do you mind if we run your card and see how I feel you've actually been

33
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,280
Really how long how long do you need

34
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,072
I don't want to take away your massage time

35
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,704
Couple minutes later I caught you one actually trying to sneak out of the gym

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,984
Or we could run his car

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,032
But I saw him out of the corner of my eye

38
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,640
Hey do you mind if we do you mind if we check your card

39
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,224
We went up to the front desk and the receptionist checked his membership card

40
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
When he swipes when he comes in

41
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,368
She picked a few different weeks and checked how often Jaquan actually goes to the gym

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,672
Turns out he's pretty consistent

43
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
The moment of truth

44
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,584
Play in a week

45
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,376
2 days a week

46
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,216
The receptionist tells me this rude awakening happens all the time

47
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,544
Do some people think they work out more than they do oh yeah

48
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616
Pandora.com using massage chair

49
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:58,272
Rather than workout

50
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,600
The result of the self-deception is obvious

51
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,416
This Planet Fitness here in Manhattan one of them

52
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952

Smack in the middle of High Gym season

54
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,304
And this gym is pretty much empty

55
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,656
The members of this gym may think they're working out a lot but they're not

56
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,472
And frankly this is the way gems like it

57
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
Customers who pay

58
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,544

79
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,264
Brewers are using Microsoft AI to help them reinvent the way they make beer

80
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,360
AI enables them to analyze raw ingredients for unique flavor

81
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,176
So they can develop better beers faster

Once it gets wiped out that's it

86
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
We will have nothing

In our language to pass to our children and the people trying to save it

88
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072

Let's be honest here

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,128
Most people don't use their gym membership

95
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Ivan Ben

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
And like 3 weeks

97
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,760
That's not that bad I haven't been in 6 months

98
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,064
And you know why Caitlin

99
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
It's this

100
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
All right everybody know we're going to go and do some push-ups

101
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,696
So the park

102
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,744
Feet slightly apart from each other

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
And

104
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Down

105
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,447
Well I'm not alone here in Planet Fitness they tell me that half of their members never set foot inside of this gym

106
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
Half of their members

107
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,287
The whole gym system is built around his fat

108
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,103
How many people can work out in the gym at 1

109
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:37,503
I'm going to take a few hundred to be completely honest this is Chris antique she manages the Planet Fitness on the upper west side

110
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,575
The gym can hold 300 people

111
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
How many members does it have

112
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
Set 6000

113
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
Wow slider members

114
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:50,559
What would happen if they all came oh my goodness you have a very crowded gym

115
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,631
Thank goodness they all don't show up at one time

116
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:58,751
Because if every member came tomorrow they would need 20 times the space

117
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,079
The treadmills would be drenched in sweat the barbells would be broken

118
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Bread lines

119
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Elliptical trainer

120
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,431
And it would cost a fortune

121
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
People actually came to the gym

122
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,551
Planet Fitness would have to charge a lot more than $10 a month

123
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
Gyms need their members not to come

124
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
Lock the doors

125
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,695
I can't tell people not to show up

126
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
So they have to rely on

127
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Consumer psychology

128
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,839
To get you excited enough that you sign up for a gym membership

129
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
That's so exciting

130
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
So you'll get up an hour early to do some crunches

131
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447

Hold back down

138

First gym track

139
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
Attract the right kind of

140
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Kind of customer

141
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
He thinks he's going to workout

142
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
But who

143
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
Customers

144
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Like this guy

145
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,439
I personally like the gym that I can get a shake

146
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,535
Goodbye in Italian

Rudy Fabiano is in his early 50s

148
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
He lives in New Jersey

149
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,935
Especially buff

150
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
He doesn't belong to

151
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Which m

152
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
Which is weird

153
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
Because he designs gym

154
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
For a living

155
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,871
We are Architects that specialize in fitness center design

156
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,735
Rudy says architecture and design can basically allow gyms to attract

157
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
The kind of customer they want

158
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,391
When he started 25 years ago the kind of customers Jim's wanted were bodybuild

159
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,207
Gyms were designed around sweat

160
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
No spaces were big Warehouse

161
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791
Houses filled with equipment

162
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
New member to baggy pants

163
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
Everybody had and

164
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
A lot of clanging

165
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
And not a lot of it

166
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
Experience

167
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,055
Beyond the experience of just lifting weights

168
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103

169
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127

170
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Memberships work Spencer

171
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
What gyms looked less like sweat Factory

172
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
What if they looked more like a fancy restaurant

173
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Our hotel lobby

174
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
Maybe you could attract someone else

175
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
A more casual exercise

176
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,487
Either the first he says the gym owners

177
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Didn't get it

178
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
I used to have these discussions with

179
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
What the gym owner has died

180
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,167
And the arguing will be with G I'm so proud of all this

181
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Equipment

182
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
I want to show it off

183
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
So I'm going to put all my

184
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,055
You know 80 pieces of cardio

185
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
Right in front when you come in

186
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
You're impressed

187
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
Am i r u b I'm not in

188
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
I'm scared

189
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,855
Cuz I clicked on a Monday night and there's people sweating around me in the noise of all those treadmills and

190
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
The experiences

191
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Is not

192
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
What we're trying to sell

193
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
To show me the experience

194
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,607
Is trying to sell Rudy took me to a gym he just finished designing in Manhattan

195
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,935
Okay Frank we're going to need something a little more mellow for this card

196
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
Alright listeners now we're going to jump into some like lifts

197
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
So this time you want to fit together

198
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
Heritage sites

199
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
To bring them down one

200
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
2

201
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,967
3D ground backup

202
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
So I was saying

203
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
Rudy took me to his newest gym

204
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
VFX

205
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
In Chelsea

206
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,951
We stand outside and it sort of looks like it could be a cocktail lounge

207
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,767
What we're looking at Clear doors and

208
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
Right across from us

209
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
Is the b f x logo

210
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,399
It's a laser cut in wood

211
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
Can see people sitting in the lounge down

212
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Stairs

213
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
Not sure what they're doing

214
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:16,383
Right and then you walk in and it looks feels like a store doesn't feel like your traditional Health Club you really don't see

215
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Any equipment

216
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,111
You know you're here obviously the music

217
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
In the van in is

218
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
You'll start seeing some more component

219
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
And of course here is the welcome desk

220
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,351
It's white marble and as a member of the out of shape public

221
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Remind me of something

222
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,799
It looks like a like a bar almost is like the same dimensions as a box

223
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,407
We like bars and this place is designed to make you feel comfortable

224
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
You feel like you could hang out

225
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,759
This kind of design it gets you in the door

226
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,367
Suddenly you're imagining yourself sitting in those chairs chatting with a friend and before you know it

227
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,415
The shelling out money for yearly membership

228
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
Or some classes

229
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,535
Jason Caitlin going to start with some subject let's go one

230
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
2

231
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
4

232
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,423
Here is another subtle signal at VFX

233
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,055
Those intense weightlifter types the ones who come everyday and sweat everywhere and cost place

234
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
This is like this a lot of money

235
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
They want to see the weight room

236
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
Heavy equipment

237
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
And in most casual gym that's hidden

238
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
The gym part of bfx

239
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
Turns out that's down a set of stairs

240
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,647
Rua Lounge behind a wall

241
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,487
And as we approach it I can start to feel myself get a little

242
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
Nervous and intimidated

243
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,303
Rudy says that's

244
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,399
Pretty common most people because there's equipment in front of you that you may not know what to do it

245
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,959
And the barbell sister big

246
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
Yeah it just looks like stuff I could never do

247
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
Why I don't do those big barbells.

248
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
I mean

249
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,431
It seems like you're trying to make a gym that doesn't look like a gym

250
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
Is that right

251
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
That's correct

252
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,039
Rudy has designed over 500 gems

253
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
That don't look like gyms

254
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
All over the world

255
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,391
So what did the track did the Wright cut

256
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Customer

257
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,207
The non sweaty bodybuilder type

258
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,279
It doesn't really matter if your customer never gets on the treadmill

259
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,327
It doesn't matter if they never use the gym

260
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
But you have to keep

261
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
The money flowing

262
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
And you know how this

263
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
Dreaded annual conf

264
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,055
Joining a gym is an interesting form of

265
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,127
What behavioral Economist called pre-commitment

266
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,967
Kevin bolts Texas Center for Health incentives and behavioral economics at Wharton

267
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
He says normally we hate

268
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,575
Lock us into doing things for certain period of time

269
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Cell phone contracts

270
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
Gym memberships

271
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
Hulk says those are different

272
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
We actually want to be locked

273
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
They're picturing

274
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
The new me

275
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,631
Who's actually going to go to the gym 3 times a week can

276
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:50,751
Become a physical fitness machine we like the idea of locking ourselves then we think

277
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
Now that I'm paying money for a

278
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,591
A year I will make myself go

279
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
And then we do

280
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
And then we don't

281
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,967
And even if we think about cancelling our membership

282
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,295
Some of those contracts are notoriously difficult to get out of

283
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,135
This business model works so well that low price gems are growing like

284
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
Crazy

285
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207
Turned out the selling stuff that nobody uses

286
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Is a great

287
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
But there's one problem

288
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
Annual contract end

289
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,935
I want people realize they haven't been using the thing they've been paying for they haven't been going to the gym

290
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
They tend to drop out

291
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,591
After the break how gyms are scheming to get you to renew your annual membership

292
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,199

Who plays of games everybody I hope your Eisenberg host of NPR's ask me another are you looking for

301
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
The answer to Life's funny or questions

302
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:58,591
Zamboni that is correct every week we blend comedy + a

303
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:03,967
Special celebrity interview

304
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,039
Rolls listen and tell your friends

305
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:13,439
Most gyms lose about half their customers every year and so they have to rely on one final trick

306
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
They have to make sure you got something valuable

307
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
Because let's be honest

308
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
Guitar apps

309
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,375
Jim's do all kinds of things

310
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Things to make themselves seem value

311
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:27,007
Remember the massage chairs equanimous using Planet Fitness has rows of them

312
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,799
Along with an Aqua Massage bed

313
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,871
A lot of gems have mixers and other social events

314
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,919
Planet Fitness also has pizza nights

315
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
And free Bagels want some

316
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,503
And those are the gyms busiest time

317
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Are you guys coming from the bagel

318
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
Breakfast at Planet Fitness

319
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
Oh yeah

320
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Is that what you guys came

321
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:49,279
This is like the most miserable day

322
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
But

323
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
You still try to actually exercise

324
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
Definite keeper babe

325
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Maybe next month

326
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:03,359
The Builder weird to eat a bagel right after you absolutely feel very weird that you just exercised and I or carbo-loading

327
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
Salmonella Bagel volume all time

328
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,551
The idea is that these folks will look back fondly on their Europe bagels and pizza and renew that annual contract

329
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Once again

330
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,135
Or I got to work out those bagels at Brandon place now

331
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,439
Come on guys pick up the pace

332
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,071
Now all of this can seem like you're being manipulated because of course you are

333
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,655
But remember every person who signs up and doesn't go to the gym

334
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,471
Is basically subsidizing your gym membership

335
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
Making it cheaper for everyone

336
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,567
If you have willpower and everyone else doesn't

337
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
You could actually work out for a week

338
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
Ridiculously low price

339
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
And think about the alternative

340
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Gyms were really about

341
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,295
Fit if they really wanted you to show up and pay for it

342
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
And all gyms would look like

343
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
It's not that nice in here there's nowhere to sit there's no mirrors in here

344
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,815
It's a really kind of barebone

345
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
Space

346
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
This is precision athlete

347
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,679
A tiny gym on the upper west side of Manhattan

348
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,007
An EVO is one of the owners and she is super fit

349
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,055
She has amazing leg muscle

350
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
From doing all these squats

351
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
Though says she has about a hundred

352
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
And 50 members here

353
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
And they all come

354
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
In fact

355
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
If you don't come

356
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
Or if you're not hardcore enough you will get

357
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,087
Kicked out of this Jam

358
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Do you ever like

359
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
Reject people

360
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Yeah

361
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,767
Yeah common thing that you'll hear is I'm too busy I have this and that

362
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Like

363
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
Vladimir Putin works out everyday

364
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,655
I would argue that he's pretty busy

365
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,959
Are you busier than he is

366
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
No

367
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
You are not

368
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
This is the kind of place where everyone knows

369
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
Exactly how often they show up

370
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,919
Andrew Atia poop has been coming to Precision for a few

371
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,711
How often do you come

372
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
I come 6 days a week

373
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Wow

374
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Yeah

375
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,111
I totally believed him the whole time we're talking

376
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,671
He keeps looking away to stare longingly

377
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
At the exercise bike if he's coming to you

378
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
There's no mirrors

379
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,327
There's no disco music playing right now

380
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,887
There is no like slogans there's

381
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
This is

382
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
Really sincere place

383
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Sincerity means

384
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Neutrik

385
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
No annual membership

386
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
No massage chairs

387
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,919
Insincerity also means your membership isn't being subsidized by all the

388
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
Placards that don't show up

389
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,063
And so we can finally see what a gym that everyone uses would actually cost

390
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Precision athlete

391
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,391
Starts at 500 bucks a month

392
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:34,655
CC here it is 2019 safety of today and we checked in with an EVO from Precision athlete

393
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,775
She left that small exclusive gym in 2016 and she's an independent personal trainer now

394
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:45,919
In the nearly five years since we talked and he says that that kind of intensive gym model has really taken off

395
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,991
And even the big gym chains have gotten on board

396
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,807
Now all the big gyms have an internal gym

397
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,647
Elevation cross-stitch of proliferation of Orangetheory

398
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,231
Sitting room townhouse everything you can think of so I think

399
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
At this point

400
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,119
You know everybody has a few Boutique gyms that they belong to

401
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
10 years ago when we first started

402
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
We are kind of the first

403
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
1 to offer that experience

404
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
Of course we have also seen the rise of

405
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
#fitspo

406
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,687
That is fitness inspiration on Instagram

407
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
At least it's inspiration

408
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,551
If you are inspired by watching people Flex in front of a mirror

409
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,855
But all this together we asked Annie

410
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,415
Does it actually inspire people to go to the gym more

411
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,487
I don't think they're actually still going to go

412
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,071
That is the problem right like where is the app that makes going to the gym less painful

413
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,703
We always love to hear what you think of the show
