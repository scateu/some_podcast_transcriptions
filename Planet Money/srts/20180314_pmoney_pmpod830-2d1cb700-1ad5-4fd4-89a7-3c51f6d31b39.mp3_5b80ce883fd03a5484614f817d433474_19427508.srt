1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,352
You are never supposed to do this and we would normally never do this

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,168
But we're going to start this episode by reading

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,960
Someone's Social Security

4
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,240
This

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,032
Is the most infamous of

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,336
Security number in the world and weirdly

7
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
The most

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,872
Popular

9
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
Social security number

10
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176
Okay here we go

11
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,480
Our apologies in advance 2

12
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,760
Hilda schrader whitcher

13
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,040
Of Lockport

14
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:23,808
York

15
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,112
Is her number

16
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,184
Is 078

17
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,488
05

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,048
1120

19
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,608
I feel terrible feel bad for Voldemort like

20
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,376
Out loud

21
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,656
If it's teenage

22
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:42,496
Your social security number is this unique part of you that you are

23
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,520
Supposed to guard

24
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,288
With your life

25
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,896
Because it is your life somebody can use it to help steal your identity charge a bunch of

26
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,920
Xboxes

27
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:55,040
Is the credit cards in your name to steal your tax refund but that is not the story of how we got Hilda Witcher

28
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,112
Chris number know this story as you may guess from the name Hilda

29
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,392
Happened a while ago

30
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
In the 19th

31
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,208
There was a manufacturer

32
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
Of wallets

33
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,536
I am so sorry to interrupt

34
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,560
We should probably entered

35
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,584
Okay

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,656
This is Carolyn Puckett longtime employee of the social

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,472
Castration and how many years did you work there

38
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,288
I work for social security for 37 years

39
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
Back in the 90

40
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,640
1930s Social Security numbers were these brand new things

41
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
People didn't

42
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,456
Really understand what they were

43
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,224
Or how you

44
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,992
You got one

45
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,784
Beer invented as part of the social

46
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
Security program

47
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
You have taxes taken out of your paycheck

48
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,160
And in the Social Security Administration would keep

49
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,696
Keep track of all that money

50
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
Using your brand new social

51
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
Security number

52
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
So 1938

53
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,584
A wallet manufacturer in law

54
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
Lockport New York decided to promote its product by showing how a social security card with it into the wallet

55
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,312
But instead of putting some random number on a piece of paper

56
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,104
The head of the company used

57
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
A very realistic

58
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,456
Can use the number of his secretary

59
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Hilda

60
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Trader

61
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
07 8

62
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,320
05

63
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
1120

64
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,160
This wallet containing Hilda's number

65
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
Was sold at Woolworths

66
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
Thousands of people

67
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
Who bought the wallet

68
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
And then got very

69
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,632
A lot of people when they got that

70
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,216
Card they started using it as their own number

71
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,544
I started working under that number

72
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
Why

73
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
Well you know they didn't really understand how you got a card they didn't understand the numbering system and so

74
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
People adopted this

75
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,832
As their social security number

76
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,696
This reminds me of if it's like buying a like a picture frame from a store and just going like

77
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
Hey I like

78
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
Beautiful couple that's in the frame

79
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,048
Is this

80
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
On my mantle

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,656
Exactly where it's like getting a frame and being like Oh

82
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
This must be my family

83
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
I should marry

84
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,336
Cool it took the Social Security Administration

85
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
Decades to clean up this

86
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,248
Matter fact the peak year that it was used was 1943

87
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,856
And at that time they were 5755 people

88
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
Still using that

89
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,560
As their own social security number and manufacturer as late as 1977 there were still 12

90
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
People

91
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,632
Using that social security number

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Hill Golf Course

93
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
Got a new social security number

94
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Panda in an interview

95
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288
She was quoted as saying

96
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
I can't understand

97
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
How people

98
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Canby

99
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,968
So stupid

100
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,552
Hello and welcome to Planet Money on Robert Smith I'm Kenny Malone

101
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
And in all seriousness

102
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
Who was Morse

103
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,160
People who thought you got a social

104
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
Security number issued

105
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
Do you throw wallet

106
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
Woolworths

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,096
Or a nation that decided to base your entire personal financial life

108
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
On a 9 digit

109
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,984
Today in the show we're going to answer a question that we've had for a long time

110
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
How did this happen

111
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
How did we fix

112
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,360
This particular system of 9 numbers

113
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Hard to remember

114
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Easy to steal

115
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,064

125
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,783
The social security number was invented at a single meeting

126
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
A gathering of what we have to assume

127
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
Where the greatest numerical mind

128
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Regeneration

129
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
Never be fair we know almost nothing about the

130
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
But we did ask

131
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,583
Did this meeting have a name like with this like the big number confab

132
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,119
1935

133
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
People fly in from around the

134
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
Probably did not fly in from around the country since they were government agencies and they tended to be headquartered

135
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
In Washington DC

136
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
True that is our friend Carolyn pocket again

137
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
Stickler for facts

138
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,015
When Carolyn worked at the Social Security Administration

139
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
And she wrote the story

140
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
How the social

141
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
Social security number wound up

142
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Controlling r

143
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:21,791
Yes and of course that was never the intention when the social security number was invented

144
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,351
Would you like to hear a little bit about the history

145
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
I think we would

146
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
It starts with

147
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:32,543
The signing of the Social Security Act on August 14th 1935

148
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
And this social security measure

149
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,431
Gibbs at least some protection

150
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,503
230 millions of asceticism

151
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,319
Franklin Delano Roosevelt 1935

152
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
Any idea of Social Security was pretty

153
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
We got your back

154
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
All workers would

155
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
Would pay into the system

156
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
And then when you can no longer work

157
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
Some money comes back to you or to your family

158
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,119
Now all they had to do was find a way to track

159
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Every

160
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Single

161
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
Worker in the United

162
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
There were already some social security type systems in Europe so the first thing they did was to contact the

163
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
The experts in Europe

164
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
To see what they suggested

165
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,943
Am I pretty much

166
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,503
Suggested that it just couldn't be done

167
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Europe was like that is at

168
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Terrible idea

169
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,903
You can't track every single person every single year for the West

170
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
Of their lives

171
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,535
Its 1935 we don't have iPhones yet in America was like yeah

172
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
Okay you're up you know what

173
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
Hold my drink

174
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
Everybody sit down

175
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
Please sit down

176
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
We bring to order the big number confab

177
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
Of 1935

178
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:44,735
The following is a re-creation but the story is based on real ideas that were on the table

179
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
Get the character

180
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
All right everybody

181
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
Yelp says it cannot be

182
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Be done

183
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,927
Let's show them how we do things in the United States

184
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
Of America

185
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Of course everyone

186
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,511
What yeah okay

187
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
So how do we tell everyone apart

188
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
Super easy

189
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,423
Let's just use everybody's names Everybody's Got a Name

190
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Technically

191
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
That was true

192
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
What was wrong with your name

193
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,871
Well as you know Robert Smith they're probably a whole lot of Robert Smith

194
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
Matter fact

195
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,223
Back in the 1930s there was

196
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,623
An association of Fred Smith in New York City because there were so many of them they were getting each

197
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,719
Each other's mail and they set up a little Association so they could have

198
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
Change mail and get everybody straight

199
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
Alright I'm across that

200
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
The floor

201
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Fingerprint

202
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:39,775
And everybody's like yeah fingerprints unique everybody's got those but of course that was

203
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,079
Connected in everybody's mind with criminals

204
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
Right

205
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:48,735
Every American worker getting hauled into a government building for fingerprinting would look

206
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Okay fine

207
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Odd numbers

208
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Numbers

209
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
Human license

210
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
Play we'll just do number

211
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
Nine of them

212
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Dashes in there

213
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
3

214
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
Number Dash before numbers

215
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,631
Who could possibly object that they're just numbers

216
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
And of course you know that somebody in the back

217
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
Have the room at this

218
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Stands up

219
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,311
A reading from The Book of Revelation

220
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
Chapter 13

221
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
Verse 18

222
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Here is wisdom

223
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
Let him that hath understanding count

224
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
The number of

225
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
The Beast

226
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,599
For it is the number of a man and his number

227
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,879
Is 600

228
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
Threescore and six

229
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Six six six

230
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
That was knocking

231
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
Not for the first three numbers

232
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,375
Social security has never and never plans to use 6 6

233
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,727
Six steps of the Social Security Administration didn't want to be accused of

234
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
Handing out the market

235
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
The Beast

236
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,591
And in fact being a sign of the end times

237
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
Alright let's wrap up

238
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,711
This confab we all agree not number is no mark of the beast

239
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
First three numbers will be

240
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
Geographic code

241
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
We will later stop doing but let's just do it for now

242
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Meeting adjourned

243
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:03,487
And that is a very dramatic version of how we ended up with

244
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
A social

245
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
The next hurdle

246
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
Was handing those numbers out

247
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,471
Sure they had to figure out what number would go to which person and then help

248
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
People would remember what their number was

249
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,615
At first it was a suggestion to give everyone their number on little metal

250
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
Dog tag

251
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
Looks like they have in the military

252
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
Which would have taken a literal tons

253
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Of metal

254
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,063
So they went with a little thick paper car they were going to send out the

255
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:33,695
And remember this isn't a huge deal you just needed this number to track your earnings and and that's basically it

256
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Like any good

257
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,815
Numerical system you start with number 1 or in this case

258
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
001

259
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
01

260
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
000

261
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,471
At first they wanted to give this lowest number away is

262
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
Like an honor

263
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,127
They offered it to a guy who played a huge role in helping Social Security get setup but he's like no thank you

264
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,175
Some other bigwig turned it down as well

265
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
And so it landed on the pile and was

266
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
Headed out like any other old number

267
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,879
That 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1

268
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,951
Went to a Grace Owens in New Hampshire

269
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,999
We know what her job was she needed the social

270
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Security number for

271
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
I don't really know anything about her

272
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
Other than she got the lowest number

273
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
Sounds like the job

274
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,215
To Intrepid reporters

275
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
Will find it okay

276
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
We started to look into this

277
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
Who was this Grace Owen

278
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,407
Who got the super special really easy to remember Social Security

279
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
She died decades

280
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
To go but

281
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
Hello hi this is Vivian

282
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
We were able to track down Vivian Clark

283
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
I only knew Grace

284
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
After I married

285
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Her nephew

286
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
In 1961

287
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,255
Vivian is I guess you'd call her at

288
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,583
Json lot of Grace Owen didn't remember much about

289
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
Grace smokes like a chimney

290
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,239
Vivian said there is another cousin who could no more

291
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
Hello

292
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
It is

293
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,127
Pamper do and I am the niece of

294
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Grace Dorothy Owen

295
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,223
Pam says her aunt Grace never had kids

296
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
She worked as a secretary

297
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575
Was married once got divorced remarried and became

298
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,855
Grace Owen muzzy

299
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
And Pam remembers that

300
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Yuan from a young age

301
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,255
This lowest number was a big deal she remembers her dad telling her about it

302
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,559
And I also remember my dad telling me

303
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
That she went on the show I've got a

304
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,847
I've got a secret was this show where a panel of celebrities

305
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Tries to

306
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,431
To figure out why you're sort of famous

307
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,015
And this is actually the only tape we could find a Grace Owen muzzy

308
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,087
What's your name where you from

309
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
My name is Grace muzzy

310
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
Concord New Hampshire

311
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,231
I'm as much as a secret with you whisper to me and will

312
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
Show TV

313
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
And that's pretty much all she said she thoroughly

314
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
Stump the panel

315
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:52,447
Oh

316
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,263
Take me to lowest number to complicated don't worry about it

317
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
And the number is 401

318
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
01

319
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
100

320
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
At this moment they are holding up

321
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
A giant

322
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Copy

323
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,039
Of her social security number for a national television audience

324
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
Like it was no big deal

325
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Which it wasn't yet

326
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,415
But if someone was watching this on live television

327
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,999
Is ensure they could like steel gray social security number

328
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,559
But probably the worst thing that they could do

329
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Is use that

330
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,631
At their job and then

331
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Their social

332
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
Security taxes would go into Grace's account

333
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
Which I guess in that case with me and the

334
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Grace would make more money

335
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Social Security

336
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
Thank you very much

337
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,455
A carton of Winston's thanks for being with you

338
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,831
She must have loved those when he does look very happy in the tape I will say

339
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
The answer to some trivia quiz

340
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
The woman with the lowest social security number

341
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
What I saw in the tape was

342
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,023
Foreshadowing of something that was about to

343
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
You don't just get a number and file it away

344
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,399
In some weird way you are your social

345
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,239
Greece was considered by the world an interesting person

346
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
Because she had an interesting

347
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,359
Until we know that eventually this number would take over our lives

348
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,919
How exactly did that happen and when

349
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
Yahoo I mean who's responsible

350
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,831
Will the federal government to some extent

351
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,903
As early as 1943 there was a

352
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
Presidential executive

353
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,767
Order a presidential executive order that says

354
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
Look

355
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,583
If you're a federal agency

356
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
And you need a new records

357
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
Stop do not invent a whole new one

358
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Take a look

359
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,495
At that thing they've got going on over at Social

360
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
Security pretty sweet

361
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
Money just use that

362
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
When did the IRS start using it

363
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
For taxes 1962

364
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,223
Around the same year the social security number becomes the ID number

365
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
For federal employees

366
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,807
Medicare starts using it for enrollment in

367
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
55

368
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,903
Veterans Administration started using it in 1966

369
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
Okay how about the department of

370
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:55,071
Department of Defense started using it in 1969 as the is the military to invitation number

371
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,887
Food stamps 1977 Federal loans 19

372
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
N82 HUD programs

373
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
1980

374
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
And just one after another

375
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
Driver's license

376
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,055
Federal workers compensation marriage license

377
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,383
The social security number becomes so broadly use

378
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
The by default

379
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
It becomes our national identity

380
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,831
At any point did the people who work for the Social Security Administration

381
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
The people who

382
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
Went to all this trouble to invent

383
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,231
This number for legitimate

384
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
Small Focus tree

385
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
Can we tell everyone to just knock it off like

386
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
You're going to ruin this number

387
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:35,519
Will the Social Security Administration does not have the legal authority to restrict the use of the social security number

388
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
Are they still don't

389
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
So there was no way so so so

390
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Security codes

391
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,175
Stop people from using it for what they wanted to

392
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
As all these agencies in

393
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
Businesses started using the number

394
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,063
What was the Tipping Point where it went from

395
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,879
And innocuous number that really didn't mean a ton

396
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
To something that

397
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
Contained your entire identity

398
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,791
I suspect when ones

399
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,887
Credit history was tied in with the social security number

400
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Your credit

401
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,983
We're just basically history of how often you have

402
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,287
Your bills on time whether you are a

403
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
Worthwhile risks

404
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
For someone

405
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,127
To extend credit or to lend you money

406
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
Decades

407
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,503
Credit reporting agencies have been Gathering all this information all this dirt on you

408
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
But all the sudden with a social

409
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Security number

410
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,927
We could tie it all together and bringing so much more information about your life

411
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
That one mistake

412
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Follow you

413
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
For decades

414
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,815
Until your social security number wasn't just tied to

415
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Government benefits

416
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Contributions

417
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
It was tied to

418
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,215
Credit cards to loans to the mistakes you

419
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,263
That's fine

420
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
As long as you know there isn't some

421
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
Conglomerate

422
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
With

423
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
Hundreds thousands millions of these it

424
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
Could you hack one day

425
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Welcome

426
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
To the echo

427
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,295
Equifax automated security freeze

428
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:57,439
The Equifax hack we did a whole episode about the history of credit bureaus and the Equifax hacking

429
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,999
You didn't get a chance to hear it check it out and you will

430
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
Here just how bad

431
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,351
Now to be fair I have personally noticed

432
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
Over the last decade or so

433
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,703
But there are fewer people putting my social security number on

434
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,031
Random forms are on my medical insurance card

435
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
People seem to be a little bit more respectful of the

436
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,407
Yeah in fact States and the federal government have

437
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
Tried to scale back the use but

438
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
The damage is done

439
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
No chapter asking

440
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
If you could go back

441
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
And we designed the cyst

442
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
Is there a better way to do it

443
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
And she said

444
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
No

445
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
Know the social security number

446
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
Is design fine

447
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
For what it was supposed to

448
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,191
But the problem clearly was that the United States sort of needed some

449
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
Kind of national

450
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
But didn't want to do it

451
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,871
Not with the picture and the fingerprint and all of the things you would actually need

452
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,455
Correctly until we find American tradition we have fast

453
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,015
The Pastels the closest thing that we had

454
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
9 digits

455
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,343
The carry the bureaucratic dreams of an entire nation

456
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
Rather than getting upset with Associates

457
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
Carolyn almost seem

458
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
Sort of like wistful about

459
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:09,119
And we do now is you Social Security numbers to children when they're born

460
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
It actually does

461
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
Track you

462
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
From your

463
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,287
First day on the planet

464
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
So your death

465
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:26,527
They say that everyone dies alone and when I'm on my deathbed I don't know if my kids will be there or if my wife

466
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
Still be around

467
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,647
But I do feel hard knowing that I'm going to be laying there with

468
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
My old companion

With no is it is that is this your real number it is my real number

471

I've got a secret I never thought I would share the voice

495
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
Have a great Monday but we did

496
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,279
But there were some negotiations about how much of that audio we

497
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,583
In fact they

498
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
Required us to license a minimum

499
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
Of one minute

500
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,959
What you heard in the story was

501
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Just about

502
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,799
35 seconds but we had to pay for a nanny

503
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,615
