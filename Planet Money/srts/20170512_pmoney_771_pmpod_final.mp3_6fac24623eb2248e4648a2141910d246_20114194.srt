This is the second part in our series on India's cash experiment

15
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,136
Last time we told you the story of the Mist

16
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,160
Serious man

17
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,744
Who came up with the idea of reducing India's dependence

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
Oncap

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
Today

20
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,352
We talked about how that idea played out in real life

21
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,656
India is so addictive

22
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,704
Did the cash the regular people keep

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
Piles of it in their house

24
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,568
Under the sink indoors with people don't use Banks

25
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,104

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
Tasha's house

27
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,920
People save money little stacks

28
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:50,944
A paper

29
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,784
So imagine the chaos when India's prime minister Narendra Modi

30
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,088
Got on TV one night and said

31
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,136
Pretty much all the cash you have

32
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
Is worth

33
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,208
Is called demonetization

34
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
Modi said he was doing this to fight

35
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
Corruption

36
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,608
No around there is black money black money is money that's outside the Texas

37
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,168
Moody said you have 8 weeks

38
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,960
Round up all of your old cash

39
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,264
And trade it in at the bank for these new bills we

40
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,032
Adjustment

41
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,592
As you can imagine in the weeks afterwards they were

42
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
Giant lines

43
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,896
To the bank Spanish

44
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:26,784
But even six months later people were discovering old money in the bookshelf or something and freaking out

45
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,136
When I visited New Delhi you could see people lined up in front of the Central Bank

46
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,440
The deadline to change old money he passed

47
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
Months ago

48
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,024
And each person there had a story about why they had missed

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
The deadline

50
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
Lycra deep-cycle

51
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,424
Pretty pink here today on behalf of his mother she was sick during the money chaos

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,984
I need this official-looking paper from the doctor

53
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,544
And so what is it what is the paper say

54
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,128
Paper said that she was in a coma

55
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,944
She was in a coma so she could not change your money

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,736
14000 rupees

57
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,552
About $210 his mother's like saving

58
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,136
She hid in her house but she didn't tell anyone because

59
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
She was in a coma

60
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,232
According to the day off of work and came to the bank

61
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
His mother's case

62
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,048
But Bank official said

63
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
No dice

64
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
Too late the money is worthless

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
How does it feel to look at that money now

66
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
What is the blank paper

67
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
Hard money

68
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
Am I your mother

69
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,056
How do you feel about all this

70
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Upset

71
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Upset

72
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
Democratization caused all kinds of Chaos

73
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,504
Austin India businesses went bankrupt because nobody had cash to buy anything

74
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,320
People died of heart attacks in the long lines

75
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,112
Some people committed suicide

76
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
When they realize that they didn't have enough

77
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
Time to change out all their money

78
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,744
About half the country doesn't even use bank account

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,792
And the government had not prepared for the

80
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,584
They didn't make enough gnucash

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,632
So parts of India world without money

82
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
And the new caste printed

83
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,240
Didn't fit into the old ATMs

84
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,544
Is public policy goes this was a disaster

85
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
And I expected for deep to be really angry at the government for taking away his mother's life savings and for all the trouble this

86
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
Disguised

87
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
But he wasn't

88
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
What is a good weight

89
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
Really

90
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
Black money

91
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
That has to be replaced

92
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,840
But with the condition that it should not affect the common people

93
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
But it did

94
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
What you still like it

95
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
Even then

96
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Pradeep was not an accept

97
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
Almost everyone I talk to in India told me the same thing

98
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
Yes it's been hard for me

99
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
Yes a lot of

100
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
People were harmed

101
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,688
But the government did the right thing

102
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:36,064
Which is striking I mean six months ago the prime minister of India basically Dropped a Bomb on the economy

103
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,880
Now pull show he's never been more popular

104
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
Somehow this whole thing

105
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,256
It was a hit

106
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,840
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

107
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,704
Prime minister Narendra Modi said this economic shock therapy was necessary

108
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
It was the only way to solve the country's corruption problem and pull India's economy into the 21st century

109
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,944
Six months later we will give democratization a report card

110
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,992
Did it work

111
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:11,136

Licensed in all 50 states nmls consumer access. Org number 3030

122
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
When Prime Minister Modi decided to take away his

123
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
PLS cash

124
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
He said this will make

125
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,351
India better

126
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
The first reason was corruption

127
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,983
Is without cash it is harder to hide money from the tax

128
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
It is also harder to

129
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
To pay a bribe or run a black market

130
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
Criminals love cats

131
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,663
So take the cash away it makes our lives harder

132
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,735
The second reason was the modernization of the Indian economy

133
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
Businesses he said could be more competitive

134
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
Grow faster

135
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
If they use Banks and electronic payments instead of pay

136
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
The third reason was Emoji said regular people would be safer and better off if they were not keeping their life savings in a drawer

137
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,839
Did access to Modern financial help

138
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
Safeway Mochi made cash

139
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,727
India eliminated the large bills put limits on new-build

140
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,799
They basically let everyone figure out how to deal with this new

141
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Society

142
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,663
So I went to India up six months after demonitization at

143
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,759
Happened to check in on these three goals to see how India was coming along

144
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,063
See how demonetization was working

145
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
My first stop

146
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
I went to talk to some farmer

147
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:53,279
Most of the population of India Farms little tiny plots of land there's a tractor that just pulled out

148
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
I drove out to ghaziabad it's a rural area outside of New Delhi and here Farmers work little half

149
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Alright next

150
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
Tomatoes and celery and sugarcane

151
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,615
I found about a dozen Farmers all standing together under a giant figure

152
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
In the middle of all the field

153
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
My name is us a preemie

154
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,527
My age is 93

155
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
93

156
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,391
Sources he and his friends meet here every morning and every

157
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,695
That my friend

158
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,487
Should you discuss

159
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
Everything

160
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
Really

161
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,607
You sit here many evening

162
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
What do you talk about

163
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
About relationship

164
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,287
Sometimes boring.

165
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
Relationships and politics

166
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Things are hard

167
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,199
The farmers don't have much land across they raise barely cover lyrics

168
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
And everything all of the business here

169
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
All done Inc

170
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,415
After Prime Minister Modi said a lot of that cash will be worthless in those first few weeks

171
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:57,023
Farmers had a tough decision to make I mean obviously they had to work that depend to their field

172
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,583
The best way to do something about their life savings

173
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
In case it was about to be rendered worthless

174
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
Virender sodhi one of the farmer

175
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
3%

176
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,567
He and all the pharmacy new had to leave the fields and go get in line

177
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
There was some people who suffered a lot

178
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
Gilbert cues

179
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,271
Since morning 6:05 till 9:10

180
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
There are people animals

181
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,367
So many poor people

182
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,183
And these are people who cannot afford to miss a day's wages

183
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,975
Daniel I'm totally panic

184
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
And nobody had money to buy anything

185
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
Farmers couldn't sell the crops

186
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,607
But small farmers also suffer

187
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
70 trucks

188
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
Soft tomato

189
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
Phone on the road

190
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
My farmers

191
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,799
Because of this monetization

192
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
Mobile

193
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
No buyers

194
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,783
And it's not like farmers can just be patient and wait it out they have to harvest the food when it's ready

195
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
And when there were no buyers they just

196
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
How to destroy their crops

197
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,927
During this time pharmacist sales of produce

198
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Drop in half

199
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,743
I almost feel like the government wanted to

200
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
The punished people

201
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,815
For using cash it was such a pain

202
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
For every one of those first few weeks

203
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,447
It almost seems like they're trying to send a message that the Hey look

204
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,519
Like you would be way better off if you just use thanks

205
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
You just had a credit

206
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:18,175
But after the lions at the banks got shorter all the farmers I talk to just went back to using cash

207
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Michael Henderson

208
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
Gross greens and onions and

209
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Bee stings

210
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
Yeah Bangalore

211
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,623
08 Lance doo doo doo

212
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
You better

213
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
You look away asthma

214
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
Yes it's a little guy

215
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:38,911
And through a translator harinder told me that he is just too old to start trying to pay for things in a new way

216
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,751
SM Naga Naga Somalia

217
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Go to something I understand

218
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
So I would rather deal with cash

219
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
I don't understand these other things

220
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
So I'm happy with you

221
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,015
Twitter said to him credit cards dangerous

222
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,319
Like someone could steal the number and use it

223
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,623
Was exactly sure how they worked and it

224
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
He wants to stick

225
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
So we're going to try and

226
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,303
Grade how Modi has done on his

227
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,399
Answer one of the reasons for demonitization was to improve

228
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
The lot of

229
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,751
Regular people in India to improve the lot of farmers

230
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
I'm going to call this grade and incomplete

231
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Because it's

232
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
Seems like

233
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
Things were very bad

234
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
And then when

235
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
Back to normal mostly

236
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
People still using cash

237
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,599
Write nothing really changed the government has claimed that Millions

238
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
The people open bank account

239
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
In rural areas

240
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,951
From everything that I've seen and read

241
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
Incomplete

242
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Okay next stop

243
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
The suburbs of New Delhi

244
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,655
We're actually not too far from the fields you can actually see a lot of the high-rises from the egg

245
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,239
And when you drive through them it's really striking

246
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,639
Because it's the obvious like nice kind of high-rise buildings and all vacant building

247
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:59,039
Building to see these buildings because they have become like a symbol of corruption

248
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Man in India

249
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
One of the main reasons modk for tomatoes

250
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,903
Station was to fight corruption

251
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
Black money

252
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,511
@booty and his advisers felt like corruption was siphoning off

253
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
The economics

254
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Success

255
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,887
Now there are a lot of ways to hide cash in Indy

256
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
But these apartment buildings

257
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,751
This is where most of the black money in India was store

258
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,823
Real estate courses the big gorilla

259
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,895
Uncle St Lucia is the author of the making

260
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,015
He says in fact high-rises like these are where most of the black money in India

261
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Store

262
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
Something like 25%

263
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Of the countries GDP

264
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
So you want to buy an apartment

265
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,743
And the price is $125,000

266
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,071
Well officially you only pay a hundred thousand

267
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
The extra 25000

268
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
You slip to the owner

269
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
In cash

270
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
He talks about it doesn't get

271
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,567
So is the owner you get $25,000 in untaxed money under

272
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
Table which is great

273
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
And as the buyer you count on being able to

274
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
To do that same thing when you sell your

275
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
But when Moody ruled out his demonetization plan

276
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
The whole system

277
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Kind of shutdown

278
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
I am stuck

279
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,951
If you were sitting with an inventory of cash that becomes exposed

280
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:14,815
And suddenly that black money has disappeared because now you can transact at the house at the high tomorrow

281
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:21,471
You will find that the builders are willing to offer anywhere between 10 to 30 40% discount

282
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,031
That's a lot that's a lot

283
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
Router table

284
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:32,223
Shock for people who are hiding or putting away the black money in some of these please

285
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,831
I'm delicious India's hole real estate market is Frozen

286
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,391
No one is buying or selling anything

287
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
Which sounds really bad

288
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:47,327
I mean it is bad for the economy although from the government's but if you I can see how they might consider this a success

289
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,887
Eunos warning this big pool of

290
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,727
A black money and eventually prices will adjust and things will return

291
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,287
That's normal but without the hole

292
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:02,431
That is true but it is still hard to know whether the actual goal of getting rid of corruption in India has been sick

293
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Successful

294
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:08,063
I need the government was hoping that tax evaders and criminals would be stuck with these huge

295
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
Stacks of cash

296
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
But they wouldn't have time to

297
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
To turn in

298
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,951
Or when they turn them in the bank would suddenly see that they had all the

299
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,535
Cash that they hadn't been taxed on that crime does not

300
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,327
He would learn the crime does not pay

301
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,983
But Bhaskar chakravorti and Economist at Tufts University even after all that drama almost all of

302
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,775
The cash in circulation in India

303
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
Still made its way back

304
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
To the banking system

305
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:37,247
Not all of that was legal cash it just happened to be the case that India has is extremely innovator

306
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
And getting around pinstripe

307
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
Innovative

308
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:47,999
Princeton's I talked to one Banker who told me that he seen a bunch of his colleagues at the bank taking huge amounts of cash from

309
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
Rich clients and

310
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
Changing it into new bills for a little

311
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
There are also stories of Rich families

312
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
Asking their maids and drivers and Cooks

313
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
To stand in line for them and change out there

314
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,055
So give me a grade 2 mod

315
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
Corruption goal

316
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,687
Needs improvement improvement is what I would say

317
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,759
Yeah but still specials right and that's not terrible for

318
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,087
Not that it is a long-term problem

319
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,903
Our next and final stop

320
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Is a market

321
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:22,815
In the city of New Delhi where we will meet people who actually are making the best

322
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,351
Of a capitalist economy

323
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
After this

324
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,727
Support for Planet Money and the following message come from ishares

325
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
Because the best

326
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
Preparation for tomorrow

327
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
Is building for your future today

328
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Ishares by BlackRock

329
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
Inspire to build

330
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,831
For my final stop I wanted to see how things had changed for the urban middle-class

331
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,903
In India remember Modi believe that getting rid of large amounts of

332
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,207
The cash would help India move into the 20

333
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,023
Businesses he said could be more competitive

334
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,583
And grow faster using Banks and electronic

335
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,167
So I went right into the heart of New Delhi to this Market

336
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
To see what people there with

337
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,055
Rowenta bhardwaj is 66 and he owns a pharmacy stall in the park

338
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,895
I'm letting my family shopping in the last 35 years

339
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,711
Do you have a lot of prescriptions I'm seeing all the way

340
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
Electric ceiling

341
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
This Market was in the very middle class

342
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:20,159
It wasn't nice Market but even still almost all of the businesses had only taken cash

343
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,999
Including or whether he was a cash man he didn't like credit cards didn't really understand how

344
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,815
Mobile payments were totally out of the question

345
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
But then demonetization happened and in the weeks afterwards going to ruin his customers still needed their first

346
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
Medicine and cash was no longer an option

347
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,615
Sober Wyndham made himself figure it out

348
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
He started taking credit cards and he even signed up for this mobile payment service called paytm where people could pay for their prescriptions

349
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
On their mobile phone

350
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,599
Has it been good for business to take the cards

351
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
Is it very good for business

352
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,975
Now it's 6 months later about half of her Windows customers

353
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
Pay with paytm or credit card

354
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,815
And he said that you can buy a little bit more than that

355
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,031
Buy credit card

356
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,103
By Paytm by debit card by check

357
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,175
When did that checks his deposits on his phone

358
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
You no longer have to walk to the bank

359
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
With cash deposit

360
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:21,599
Everyday and he loves this he's become such a convert then in fact he has stopped using cash himself

361
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
My bus now

362
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
All credit card

363
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,255
Oh you don't use cash no no no no no no

364
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,071
Most of the stores in the market now take credit cards

365
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
All the stores in the market take mobile payments from this company called paytm everywhere I went in India

366
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Was talking about

367
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,567
Paytm and how big they've gotten since tamada today

368
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:48,479
So I thought I would go check out the company paytm for BTM

369
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,039
Monetization was like the greatest gift ever

370
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,087
Because when the government got rid of most of the

371
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
The cash in the country

372
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
It really offer an alternate

373
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,951
Medora is the CFO of

374
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,791
How do you say Gwen Mooney Mages announcement the company new

375
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,583
This was their moment

376
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,143
Then we should jump into action

377
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,935
So we have front page ads

378
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
In the next day's newspaper

379
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,775
Pigeon wasn't exactly a household name

380
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,615
It's a lot of the ads were just like hey we are here you can pay for stuff with

381
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,479
Other ads with these kind of DIY instructions to businesses and employers

382
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,319
Basically explaining as simply and clearly as possible

383
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,159
How to use the paytm phone app how mobile payments work

384
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,975
One of the eyes that you did was quite proud off

385
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,535
A quarter of that bed.

386
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,863
The merchant who literally cut the character of that ad

387
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
I just put that up

388
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,471
I just put in their name and their mobile number

389
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
That they put on the wall

390
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:49,151
What's their name and their mobile number was on the wall customers could use that information to pay them through the paytm app

391
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:56,831
And businesses were desperate to do this they were all signing up little roadside vegetable stands hardware stores taxis

392
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,159
Even temples started letting people leave offerings with

393
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Paytm

394
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
I know India is a big

395
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Country but

396
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
The growth rate for KTM

397
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
Was seeing

398
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,887
Was pretty amazing half a million people were signing up everyday

399
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,703
120 million Indians now use page

400
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
I believe government this is also good news

401
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,055
Because unlike cash

402
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,871
ATM transactions are trackable they are taxable

403
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:24,479
Between the credit cards and the mobile app seems like this whole unseen part of the economy

404
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
What's up me out in the light

405
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
So if you look specific

406
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,135
Get the part of the Indian economy that was sort of on

407
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
The Verge

408
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Of

409
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,535
Move away from cash anyway if you look at them the people were talking about here

410
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
When I give the grade

411
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Satisfied

412
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
Satisfactory for sure

413
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
And if we talk about the beginning

414
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,959
Moody does deserve

415
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
Some extra credit because

416
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,079
I got to say I've never seen a political official

417
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,383
Who changed the economy overnight

418
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
And

419
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
People still

420
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
Approved

421
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
People still forgave him for what he

422
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
And it wasn't just a question of forgiveness

423
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,623
This milk actually made Modi

424
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
More popular

425
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,463
His approval ratings are now at 69%

426
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,511
Justin credible for a politician

427
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:13,119
And almost everyone I talk to in India supported modi's demonetization plan

428
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,911
Even people who really suffered

429
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
Actually especially

430
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Would really suffered.

431
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,591
And when I asked him why a lot of them told me that they stand in long lines all the

432
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,151
The time and deal with frustrating bureaucracy all the

433
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
All the sudden that they're standing in line

434
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
For a reason

435
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Just work corruption

436
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,295
Spanish Taxi

437
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
All them standing in line and going through all this bureaucracy

438
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
How to patriotic Purp

439
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
You know this explains

440
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
A lot what I was listening to the last episode with

441
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
Which was about Anil bokil

442
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
The architect

443
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
He had

444
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,727
This strange moment with you when he was talking about demonitization

445
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
In almost

446
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Religious

447
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,103
Is it exciting to watch it play out in real life

448
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
If you don't refrigerate

449
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
I want joy

450
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
In excitement

451
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
You call it enlightened

452
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
I'm in line

453
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Your lighting

454
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,487
And now I kind of understand it Enlightenment means

455
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,303
Finding side of a greater meaning and purpose

456
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,351
In even the difficult things in life

457
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
And that's essentially

458
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
What Indians doing right now

459
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
Yes and I've heard this from a lot of

460
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,823
People including her deep-set go to the man whose mother lost her life savings

461
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,383
Because she went into a coma at the wrong moment

462
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,199
He was standing there with his mother's worthless cash and

463
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
His hand

464
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:36,831
You said he was just so fed up and so frustrated with all the corruption in his car

465
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,647
Finally felt like things were changing

466
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
Like booty was fixing

467
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,279
I asked him what he was going to do with all the old bills that had belonged

468
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
With Mom

469
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
Baby arriving today frame

470
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
1080p snow desert 500

471
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
You frame it

472
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
Maybe

473
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,751
But my next next generation

474
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:00,639
Oh so that your family can see what the old

475
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
Just for the sake of showing the p

476
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Like

477
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Here it is

478
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,551
Here is a token of a sacrifice we all made

479
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
For the country

480
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,391
