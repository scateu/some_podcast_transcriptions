1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,304
One of my favorite economy

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,376
Dan ariely tells the story about a locksmith

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,960
When the locksmith was new at his job when he was an apprentice

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:12,288
He took a really long time to open a lock

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,616
And people say I'm working away struggling

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:20,224
Really having a hard time and often they'd end up giving him a tip

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,040
But then when the locksmith got better it is

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:27,648
We got so good at his job you could open pretty much any lock in just a minute or two

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,184
Ben

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,488
His customers started complaining

11
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:36,352
They were like you want $200 for that the stuff you like 30 seconds

12
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:41,984
And you can see why right I mean we tend to think the harder someone works the more they should get

13
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,032
Yeah but it's also kind of ridiculous

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,688
I mean this guy was better at his job when you call a locksmith you want to get into your car or your house as fast as pause

15
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,504
And that was what he was doing

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,320
He was giving customers what they really want it

17
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,624
But they felt cheated

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,648
His bills

19
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,672
Suddenly felt

20
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,440
Unfair

21
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,024
A lot of companies operate under exactly this

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
They were warned people for how much they work

23
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,400
A person who stays late at the office the person

24
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,216
Who comes early they are more likely to get

25
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
Promotion

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,776
But maybe this is wrong

27
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,336
Maybe hard work is irrelevant

28
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,896
Maybe we should matter is what we create

29
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,712
Maybe company should be measuring our output

30
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,016
And not keeping track of our input

31
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,344
What would happen if you ran a company based on that idea

32
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,624
What was that

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,304

Rip Astoria

36

Patty McCord

37
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,752
One woman who has waged war against the idea of rewarding hard work

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
In the workplace

39
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
You may not know her name

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,640
But chances are pretty good she has already affected

41
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,408
Did your life

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,552

Patty McCord is kind of an accidental

53
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Crusader

54
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
Is a kid

55
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
She moved around a lot

56
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
She grew up in West Texas

57
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,792
Florida than Northern California

58
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
After High School

59
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
She got a job in a lumber

60
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,680
Eventually she quit that job put herself through

61
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,264
Watch and landed at a small startup in the late 1990

62
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,312
Start up with sending people

63
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
DVDs through the mail

64
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,640
Movies television shows

65
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
Start up with Netflix

66
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,480
And Patty McCord helped build Netflix

67
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,296
From this tiny startup into what it is today

68
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
If I die

69
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,648
Tomorrow other than my family

70
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,720
This is the thing I'm most proud of in my whole life

71
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
I mean

72
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,816
Which is a bunch of people came

73
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,352
Together we made this

74
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
At Netflix

75
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
Patty was in charge

76
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
Hiring and recruiting

77
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,008
And the company was growing really fast

78
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,384
But in the beginning Patty says the company was actually just this tiny group of people in a

79
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
How did junkie office

80
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
Working from a bunch of cards

81
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
We were poor

82
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
You know I'm the early days of Netflix

83
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
We had to buy DVDs and stamps and envelopes

84
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,560
This was long before it became a giant multi-billion-dollar company

85
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,376
In the early days it almost went bankrupt

86
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,680
And this was a formative event

87
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
Maybe even more than the

88
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
Company successes

89
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,544
Because it led them to rethink

90
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
The whole idea

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
How a workplace should funk

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
This was around 2001

93
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
The tech bubble and burst

94
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
The company was limping along

95
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
Running out of money fast

96
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,624
And Patty who had been in charge of hiring people

97
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
Was now in charge of firing

98
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,488
So we laid off 1/3 of the company

99
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,863
The third night we were only a hundred 20 people or so but still it's one two three one two three

100
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,679
Patty and the company CEO Reed Hastings had to come up

101
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
They got rid of some movie room

102
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
Actually all of them

103
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
Some engineers

104
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,127
And you know how every company has that one guy in the corner and you're like

105
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
What exactly does he do

106
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
That guy

107
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
They fired me

108
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,575
And think I would have lots of people who'd been there since the beginning but

109
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,391
Who maybe weren't completely essential

110
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,951
For people to company this was awful

111
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
It was a terrible

112
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
And then

113
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
Weirdly

114
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
It was kind of

115
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
Great

116
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,887
They came into work and realize the company was just

117
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
Working better

118
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,215
John 10 QT was an engineer there at the

119
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775
The experience I had was

120
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,335
Much greater freedom

121
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,639
Nobody was there

122
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,223
Who didn't have a job that felt critical to Our Success

123
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
Everyone who was left was

124
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,319
Really really good

125
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903
Bill Koontz another Engineers has afterward they could just

126
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
We can get this done

127
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
With a small group

128
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
The people we have

129
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,767
Have no choice

130
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
So now we got double the reason

131
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Do it so

132
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Let's go.

133
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Was that fun

134
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Oh yeah

135
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
The company was still losing money

136
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,823
It was still going to have to raise a lot more cash or die

137
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
But the entire vibeage

138
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
The bureaucratic garbage was

139
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Besides

140
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:44,831
Travel approval to your expense reports fewer meetings they were all doing more accomplishing more work with

141
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
Fewer people

142
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,927
In those days Patty McCord and Reed Hastings Netflix

143
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,975
CEO would carpool to work

144
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,535
We're in the car driving and I'm like

145
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:00,447
Why is this so fun I can't wait to get to work I don't want to go home at 9 I mean

146
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,543
We're working so hard what is it about this and recycle find out

147
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,639
Let's find out let's write it down

148
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:13,759
And at that moment Reed Hastings and Patty McCord decided they wanted to build a big

149
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
Company that would always work

150
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,463
One that had exceptional people a company that rewarded employees not for trying harder showing up

151
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,743
Copper being there from the start

152
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,559
Actually accomplishing great things

153
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,143
They decided to try and change the social contract

154
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
Around work

155
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,727
And bit by bit they wrote down their ID

156
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,311
And eventually it became this legendary slide

157
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,895
Actually still shown to all new employees at Metro

158
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
And it had a huge impact

159
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,527
A few years ago they posted it online and it went viral

160
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,063
12

161
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
Million views

162
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,671
And Sheryl Sandberg the CEO of Facebook called it

163
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,511
The most important document to come out of Silicon Valley

164
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:02,143
Suits TV were showing me these lies and if you've ever wondered what life is like in Silicon Valley or

165
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Why this company

166
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
He's become so successful and grow so fast

167
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Do you slide

168
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
Tell you a lot

169
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
One of the key slides

170
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Reeds Jewelers

171
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
Hard work

172
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Not relevant

173
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:18,015
It says quote we don't measure people by how many hours they work or how much they're in the office

174
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
In other words

175
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
We don't really

176
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
Care how hard you

177
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
How much effort

178
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,439
We only care about

179
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Results

180
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
We care about your health

181
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
Not your input

182
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Netflix

183
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,607
Now offers unlimited vacation

184
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,703
And it pays more than pretty much any other company out here

185
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Silicon Valley

186
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
But to get a job

187
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,847
They're in to keep it you have to accomplish great things

188
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
So here's another slide

189
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
And this one feels a little bit harsher

190
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
It says quote

191
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
We are 18

192
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Not a family

193
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
And we are a pro sports

194
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
Not a kid's Recreation

195
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
In other words

196
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,975
If they don't need you anymore or the business changes

197
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,511
Or things aren't working out

198
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
You will be cut

199
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
Don't expect this to be a job

200
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
App for life don't expect to stick around

201
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
Netflix live by this philosophy

202
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,543
Even in really good times

203
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,871
Like when Netflix started streaming movies and bat

204
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,919
Off the company started growing like

205
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
Crazy people

206
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
Love streaming movies they thought

207
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,807
This is so much better than ordering a movie

208
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
Through the mail

209
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
I can just

210
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
See the movie I want click on it

211
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
Watch it right away

212
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:32,255
Netflix at this point starts growing so fast it was about to break

213
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
The internet I mean really break the internet

214
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:40,447
Streaming online takes a huge amount of data and Netflix just wasn't equipped to deal with it

215
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,263
If suddenly the entire country decided to

216
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
To start streaming

217
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
But it looks like that was about to happen

218
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Soon

219
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:52,479
Executives figured they had less than a year to fix this problem so they went to This brilliant team eventually

220
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,063
The same people who made streaming work in the first

221
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
And they said

222
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
What we got to fix this

223
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,415
No worries

224
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
We'll build it

225
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,607
You guys going Zack something we'll build it clap you know we'll build a cloud-based Computing we can do that

226
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
Actually you guys probably could

227
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
Not 9 months

228
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
But not in 9 months

229
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
That was streaming D-Day

230
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
And that's when they had to get

231
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
The standby

232
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
So they have this incredible team

233
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:28,063
But the executive decide they're going to have to hire someone else to solve this problem

234
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
They use Amazon Data Center

235
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,463
Netflix's Engineers were not

236
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:41,631
They're like well are we toast right at 4 and if we're going to go to somebody else to do it what happens to us

237
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679
I don't know but we got to be honest

238
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
The honest truth was they were toe

239
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,055
There wasn't going to be a role therefore

240
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,639
I mean this is a team of Engineers that was so talented

241
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:57,247
Did they had basically taken Netflix to this point of explosive growth

242
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:03,391
And now the company is just going to get rid of them because there's nothing for them to do at that moment

243
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
That just seems so

244
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
Crazy

245
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
It's actually not that Chris

246
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,583
I mean the entire team and read the slides they knew the deal

247
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
They were at net

248
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,447
That's because they wanted to solve really interesting problem

249
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,519
When their role didn't exist anymore

250
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
They left on their own Patti actually didn't need to fire these

251
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
They went out and found new job

252
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Before she had the chance

253
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
In a way the system works

254
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,575
But this is still a big shift in terms of how you think about a job

255
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,671
Some people came to Netflix and expected that they be able to

256
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
The state as long as they worked

257
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
And did

258
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Good work

259
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,071
Patty remembers one worker who did Prada

260
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
And she was about to lose her job

261
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,447
Because basically it had become automated

262
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
And this worker was

263
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
So

264
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,055
Upset so I called her up in my

265
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
What's up with you just like I

266
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:58,175
I can't believe you treated me this way I mean after all this time I'm like

267
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Kim in here

268
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,503
So she comes in she sits down I'm like

269
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
What part of this is this

270
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:11,743
She said well I'm like we've been talking about this as a strategy for years you been I've been me I said next

271
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:17,887
We talked about this and I think you could find me another place in the company like I can but

272
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,935
The same things going to happen to me now

273
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,007
I really cannot be making something up for you and she said well

274
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,567
And I worked really hard this really unfair

275
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
Mike

276
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
Pranks I can like

277
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,247
Dry your tears and hold your head up and go be from Netflix

278
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
Why you think you're the last one here

279
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,879
Cuz you're the best

280
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,951
Credibly good at what you do we still need to do it anymore

281
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
Patty have a lot of experience

282
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,583
It's doing that so she became what she calls the queen

283
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
Have the good goodbye

284
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
How many

285
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,191
How many people do you think you have fire

286
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,287
Oh I would really like to remove that word from Marvel

287
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,639
Vocabulary because for one thing I hate all of our militaristic terminology in

288
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,943
We don't shoot people

289
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,783
And we're going to have long careers you and me I mean

290
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,647
We're going to work at a lot of different companies and if we can start as employees

291
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,463
Thinking of our careers as Journeys and

292
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:19,071
Places that we go and things that we explore then we're going to not get all wigged out

293
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,655
When things change and it doesn't work out

294
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
What word do you like

295
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:29,567
Severed is Pleasanton fired

296
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,431
How many people have you moved on

297
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,015
I don't know Steve this makes Netflix sound like

298
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
A really hard place to work

299
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,367
Yeah for some people I think it is

300
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,439
A lot of people I talk to really like that but there's a downside

301
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
To work in a place like that

302
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
Some employees there

303
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
Talk about a culture of

304
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
I like that for everybody

305
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
But for some people it definitely is

306
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,727
And you know you can look at that slide hard work doesn't matter we don't track hours

307
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
Integrate

308
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,591
I'll just finish early and then take the rest of the day off I'm an adult

309
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
Control of my life

310
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
But another way to read that slide

311
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,271
Is that hard work is not necessarily enough

312
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
Working hard is no guarantee

313
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
20 Eur

314
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
And most of the employees and

315
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,695
Former employees at Netflix who I talk to

316
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
They work

317
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Frazee

318
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
Heart and Angela looks also

319
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,351
I think I was Employee like number 32

320
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,215
It was hired to do marketing but ended up in the early days doing just a bit of everything

321
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,287
She even spent one Christmas Eve sorting DVDs

322
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
And she loved this company

323
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
She lived in

324
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
Breathed and bled nuts

325
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
She was super loyal

326
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
She worked

327
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
Until she was exhausted

328
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
Slept then got up and did it again

329
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
And again

330
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,647
And eventually she work so hard she got sick

331
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
She developed chronic

332
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Back pain

333
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
That just

334
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
Kept getting

335
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Worse

336
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,423
When I was initially hurt and I needed some time away I just wanted to Paddington I have to take a break didn't want me to type it

337
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,751
Don't be sitting all this, okay

338
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,823
It's all she said okay

339
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
Let me know when you're feeling better

340
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
I was at 4 weeks

341
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:14,015
And I kept checking in like I'm thinking through fire me they're going to go there and find somebody else

342
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,087
I just sent a note saying they still want me to breastfeed right back

343
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
Okay hope you feel better

344
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
6 weeks

345
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
8

346
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,767
10 weeks I finally went to her and I said

347
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,423
You maybe should formalize this maybe I need to go on short term disability or something like that because if that's what you want to do

348
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
Kiddo I don't know

349
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Okay

350
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,871
And I know it immediately is just like okay the Gordie pivoted

351
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,991
That's a really hard story to hear I mean to be fair

352
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Netflix was struggling

353
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
At that point

354
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
And Angela new

355
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
There was no job there

356
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
But they needed doing

357
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
She was capable

358
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
The company had to

359
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,583
But you know when I hear her tell that story and I hear her talking about Netflix

360
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,655
I can't help but be reminded of that fly

361
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
We are a team not a family

362
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
You know

363
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,775
For Angela working at Netflix was one of the best

364
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
Why she still loves

365
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
People who she

366
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
But the deal

367
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
At that company is just

368
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
But maybe not that differ

369
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
At least not anymore

370
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
Because Patty and the slides

371
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
The huge impact

372
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
Oliver Silicon Valley

373
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
And all over the country

374
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
People have looked at these ideas and

375
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
I have adopted

376
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,327
Netflix series this is a big reason for its success

377
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,655
The company's business has gotten bigger and bigger and bigger butt

378
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,959
Its Workforce is lean and

379
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Flexible

380
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,031
Mean when DVDs were no longer a thing

381
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Fine

382
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,591
Netflix mastered streaming

383
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:48,991
Then when Hollywood decided to raise the prices for TV shows and movies no problem Netflix started making its own

384
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,319
Ten Years After the layoffs the company seem Dunst

385
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:59,231
Read what's on the cover Fortune he's the best CEO of the year we are acquiring a million subscribers a month

386
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
We were

387
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
Rolling in dough

388
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
We're alike

389
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
We are

390
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
I'm amazing and you know what

391
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,191
So are you awake

392
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
So are we

393
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,079
Amazing what can we do anything we want

394
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
Everything was gold

395
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
There's no way we're going to fail

396
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
You can guess what happened next

397
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
They failed

398
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,039
You know some of you may remember this

399
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,087
Because it made customers Furious

400
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,415
Netflix announced it was going to split into two separate comp

401
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,231
One for streaming and one for DVDs

402
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
And that meant that if you wanted to get

403
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
Both you had to pay twice

404
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,119
Two bills instead of one

405
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
And it was a big

406
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Pricing

407
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Customers revolt

408
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
Yeah I actually canceled my Netflix membership

409
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,871
They lost something like 800 thousand customers in a month

410
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,479
During this. Every morning Patty would wake up open or laptop

411
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
Check the headlines

412
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,551
And the backlash it was right

413
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
On the front page of every

414
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Paper

415
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,159
I'd read that Stephen and I go throw up

416
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
What heart

417
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
We were so

418
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
Was so

419
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,839
And this is one that lean efficient machine Patty helped build

420
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
This monster of a company

421
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
Reach.

422
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
And got

423
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Her

424
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,567
How do you been a big supporter of splitting Netflix into and it had been a disaster

425
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,383
The same time Netflix was also involving

426
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
They were moving to Hollywood

427
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,503
Making shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black

428
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
And Patty had no eggs

429
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Burien

430
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
An entertainment

431
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,391
No experience hiring Direct

432
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
For that kind of

433
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Production

434
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,767
Her skills were no longer needed and at the end of that year

435
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
She Andre Jesus had a conversation

436
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
How do you move

437
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
She still doesn't like to talk

438
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
But she said leaving was terrible

439
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
And painful

440
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
Sad

441
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Today she's in a good

442
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
She's in demand

443
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
Epic Consulting

444
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
She's happy

445
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
But what you talking about nuts

446
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,247
Looks she still uses the pronoun

447
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Ennui

448
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,807
Describe her company

449
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,623
And no matter what those slides she helps rights

450
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
The people who built Netflix

451
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
With her

452
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,487
Still feel like a family

453
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
Even though really

454
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
They are 18

455
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
And Patty

456
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
Has been cut

457
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,359
Hey it's Stacy against soap since we ran this episode in 2015 Steve has left and

458
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,175
Backyard to start his own company we miss him very much

459
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:30,271
But it also means that he's got to try some of these ideas out for himself

460
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
We check in with him right after that

461

So this episode ended up being kind of a pivotal moment in Steve

470
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Penn's life

471
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
Soon after he reported the show for us

472
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
He left to start his own company

473
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,071
Is called tiny garage lab

474
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,631
They make an audio app called 60db

475
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,471
Patty McCord she actually became one of their early investors

476
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,775
And one of Steve's co-founders John Chang

477
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,847
Cootie is the former Netflix engineer who you heard from

478
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
Very briefly in this episode

479
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,295
He's so bitter that he's only in the podcast

480
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
Horrible cold

481
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
My mother heard that

482
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:43,743
Can't you called me up and she was like are you dying

483
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
Steven John met through this podcast

484
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,351
Any talk about the Netflix culture a lot in there

485
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,935
So we asked them the big Netflix question

486
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
Are you a team

487
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,007
Or are you a family

488
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
What are family

489
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
I think

490
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,991
The most concrete aspect of the team versus family

491
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,319
Orientation at Netflix

492
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,879
The willingness to let someone go when it's not a great sat

493
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,231
John used to work at Netflix so he has a lot more experience with this

494
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
Send Steve.

495
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:21,631
And of course it's one thing to report about this type of culture but it is another thing to actually do it

496
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,191
We asked Steve about the first time he fired some

497
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
@tiny garage light

498
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
John listen to me like

499
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,591
Agonize over that particular to ceiling for months

500
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,663
He did not even want to use the word fired

501
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,503
I mean I don't think it's I don't know I'm not sure I'd describe it as fiery

502
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,039
That employees still Feelin It

503
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:44,671
And John Steve agree that their company culture is not like Netflix in every way

504
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
But in some big waves

505
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:52,351
