1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,792
Here is something that I learned

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:04,352
In the air above us

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,144
At 35000 FT

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,936
It is the same

5
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:08,704
Time

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,728
Everywhere

7
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,312
Universal time which is the time at the Greenwich Meridian

8
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,616
Is you

9
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,688
All around the planet Earth today

10
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,248
Buy every single

11
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,552
Airline and Air Force

12
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,832
In the world

13
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:29,184
This is Dick Henry he's an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University

14
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
Think about it

15
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,256
Are all these

16
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,560
Planes flying all over the Earth

17
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,096
A hundred miles an hour

18
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:41,984
You don't want to get confused by time zone when you're trying to keep them from crashing into each other

19
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,848
Dick has talked to his friend Steve hanke about this for years

20
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,872
Steven economist

21
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:51,200
A professor of Applied economics at Johns Hopkins and

22
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,504
It is not just

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,296
Pilots who need universal time

24
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
Investors needed to

25
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,136
You can trade

26
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:04,512
24-hours a day almost around the clock and gold currencies

27
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,072
Stocks and everything else under the sun

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
And

29
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
Those are

30
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,216
All timestamp using universal time

31
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,800
Henke and Henry were telling me about all this because

32
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,848
Proposal

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,664
Yes Steven I want to abolish the time zone

34
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
No more

35
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,480
Time zones

36
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,320
We want 24-hour World Time everybody on the same clock

37
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,368
You're you're you're fully serious about this

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,160
Is this a serious proposal

39
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,720
Course it's a serious proposal

40
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,512
If it's 10 in New York

41
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,816
It is 10 in Shanghai

42
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
And Sydney

43
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
And Nairobi

44
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,936
It is 10

45
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,216
Everywhere

46
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:50,592
Hank and Henry have also designed a whole new efficient standardized calendar

47
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
The hanke Henry permanent calendar

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
His hanky Henry

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
Time and calendar

50
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,552
It's rigged up with an extra week every five or six years so that the calendar is

51
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,600
Standard year-to-year

52
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,672
Like January 1st is always a Monday

53
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,560
Come on we waste so much time for your dusting calendar is your year it's unnecessary

54
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:15,424
What would happen if the hanke Henry calendar where adopted oh my goodness

55
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,008
There'd be a couple of years a bumps and grinds if people read

56
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,544
Adjusted their schedule

57
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
But then we'd have it at an absolute

58
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
Optimum

59
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,944
And it would never ever change for the rest

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
Of human history

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
This is

62
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,272
Very

63
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,064
Hard for me to imagine

64
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,160
Two guys changing the way time works for everybody

65
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
Forever

66
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
And yet

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,304
About a hundred fifty years ago there was

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Another guy

69
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
The hanke Henry of his age

70
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
Who decided

71
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,264
I am going to completely change the way time works

72
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,312
For everybody in the United

73
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
And

74
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,968
Everybody in the United States is still living on his clock

75
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
Today

76
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,440
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm finally home time as we know it in the u.s. today

77
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,024
On a single day in 1883

78
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
It happened then because this new technology the railroad was completely transform

79
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
Arming the world

80
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240

83
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
What

84
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Time is it

85
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200

00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392

00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,143
I sometimes jokingly refer to it as the NASCAR ring of our food like it has a new episode making

107
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
Can I start having you just introduce yourself

108
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,087
Sure I'm Alexis Macross and I'm a professor of history at Southern Methodist University in Dallas TX

109
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,927
Can you tell me about sort of your background in time

110
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,487
My background didn't I

111
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,583
Well I was born to live

112
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
She was born she lived

113
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,959
And eventually she wrote a book about the history of timekeeping

114
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
In the United States

115
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
Start the story in the early 1800s

116
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,639
The concept of time in the early eighteen-hundreds is much

117
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
Looser than it is for us today

118
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,503
Some watches at the time didn't even have minute hands

119
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,855
People are mostly Farmers living local lives governed by the

120
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,695
If I need to travel to probably catch a stagecoach

121
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:23,327
I need to know like I need to get to the stagecoach Depot in the morning but

122
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
Stagecoaches

123
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:29,983
Capri Blue schedules they did not leave precisely at 9 at the top of the hour

124
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,079
They rang the bell they let people know we're about to leave

125
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,407
They hung around they took off very slowly

126
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,479
Because nobody's timekeeping was precise

127
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
Got their work clock

128
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,599
But every clock in town showed a slightly different

129
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
Time

130
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Gradually

131
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
Life Starts

132
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
To speed up

133
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Steamships

134
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Factory

135
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
The mail it comes all the time now

136
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,095
People need to coordinate more

137
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
So inch-pound a degree

138
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
Okay

139
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
This particular clock

140
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
Shows the official local time

141
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
For our town

142
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
Like how many local times were there

143
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
How many towns in America were there

144
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
How many places were there

145
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
There were

146
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,783
23 local times in Indiana

147
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
27 in Illinois

148
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
38th and Michigan

149
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,695
It switches every few minutes that each small community

150
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,023
He's going to have a different Sun Time by 10 minutes 5 minutes

151
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
3 minutes

152
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
This is Richard White

153
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
Historian

154
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
He wrote a book about railroads

155
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,703
And railroads are going to become the

156
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
Key part of the story

157
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,823
All of human history before trains

158
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,919
The fastest anybody could travel Overland with the speed

159
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
The panda with railroads

160
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
That suddenly changes

161
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,623
Before it could take a month to go from New York to Chicago

162
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
And by the 1850s you can do it in

163
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
2

164
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Date

165
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,303
And all my journey a train would roll through

166
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,887
You know maybe hundreds of different local time

167
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,471
Clearly this time world is not built

168
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
4 train

169
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,823
I mean obviously it's confusing if you're riding on the train

170
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
And also it's just

171
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
Dangerous

172
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,967
There were a couple cases where people running the train Scott confused about the time

173
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
And trains

174
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
Crashed into

175
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,087
What's the weather like

176
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
We have got to find a way to coordinate this among ourselves

177
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
And they come up with a system

178
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,255
They met twice a year and arrange their schedule

179
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
And what they did is each

180
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,351
Train ran on its own time

181
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
If you run the New York Central Line

182
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,959
You set the time to Albany New York

183
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:42,847
No matter what time it was in the exact place the train stops along the way it's always New York time

184
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Zoe train was like

185
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,503
It was like the train itself had a timezone almost you're the train is a traveling times

186
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
Was that confusing for passengers

187
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
Yes

188
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,159
Could very confusing for passengers

189
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
If you get off of a railroad

190
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
Car

191
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,839
In a place like Buffalo would you would do is look up and you would see three or four different

192
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,143
Turn clocks would be much like we see in the air

193
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
In airports you can see all it's that time in Copa

194
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Set timing at

195
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
To set time in Beijing

196
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,103
When you got off the train you would see

197
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,919
The time is it set for the New York Center

198
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,247
UBC the time that it said for the trains coming out of Boss

199
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:27,647
You see three or four different clocks each of them giving you a different time all them different from the time on your watch

200
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
And all of them different from the time where you were standing

201
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
Do you have to figure out

202
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,303
What time to get on the train by those clock

203
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,887
At the center of his whole ridiculous time system

204
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
Is one man

205
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
William

206
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Allen

207
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
He's like the railroads

208
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
Time

209
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
Tsar when his Jobs is

210
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
Kateri of the general time convention

211
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:53,759
It is his job to keep track of every schedule every train size

212
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
Timezone every

213
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
End

214
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,903
He's not like a fancy Railroad

215
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
Baron

216
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
He's more like a bureaucrat

217
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,047
A newspaper description of him from the time it said that he had

218
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,887
Start of a nervous vibe that you look like an Episcopal preacher because he wore this

219
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
High collared vest that button up the front

220
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:18,847
Passengers were complaining all the time about this really confusing system Alan would have heard from them there

221
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
Staying calm on

222
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Wheeze

223
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Fix this

224
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
There's a high school principal name Charles Dowd

225
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Who has become obsessed with

226
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
Changing the way we do time

227
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,671
Yeah yeah we all know people like this it just gets fixated

228
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
That is like all right everybody

229
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
Picture this

230
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,327
We divide the country into

231
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
4

232
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,655
Sort of vertical

233
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
Ariel

234
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
Like

235
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
Zone

236
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
And then eat

237
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
Zone

238
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
It is the same

239
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
He tries to commits the railroads

240
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,527
He writes letters back and forth with William a Fallon on the railroad

241
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
Islands like no

242
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
Everything's fine

243
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
But by the late 1870s

244
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,023
It's clear that this world where every town and every train has its own time

245
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Just

246
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
Isn't working anymore

247
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,679
Trains are everywhere now they're moving people from town to town

248
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
Moving stuff

249
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
All the way across the country

250
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
America is becoming less

251
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,591
A collection of isolated towns

252
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
And more one big

253
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Country

254
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,759
Around 1880 this one scientist

255
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Hussein

256
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,903
I got all these meteorologists all over the country trying to coordinate their observations

257
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,231
No one can figure out like huzzah what shooting star when

258
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
The railroads

259
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,631
Should just divide the country into a few

260
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
Factors

261
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,191
Each an hour apart

262
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
Like Zone

263
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
Sounds of time

264
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
An island finally decides

265
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Okay

266
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
The principal and the scientist

267
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Are right

268
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,015
The era of every town having its own time is over

269
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
We need

270
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
To standardize

271
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Haim

272
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
And I am the man

273
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
To do it he wants

274
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,023
Everybody to go and standard time he wants to obliterate local

275
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
So he engages in this

276
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
Vas campaign

277
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
Bobbing

278
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
City council's

279
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
And Mares

280
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
And

281
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,287
Astronomical Observatory

282
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,615
And anybody who was involved in

283
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
Timekeeping

284
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
Allen is

285
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
Not really Consulting the general public on this

286
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:37,855
Republic is mostly into it there are some people who are skeptical there was apparently

287
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,903
One preacher in Tennessee who said

288
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
We follow

289
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
God's time

290
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
Not railroad time and

291
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
He smashed

292
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,559
Is watch on Pulpit with a hammer to make the point

293
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
But

294
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
Allen isn't so concerned about that

295
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,959
This negotiation is happening in the various Halls of power

296
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
And it's kind of a

297
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
Struggle for a

298
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
Authority

299
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,591
Who has the authority to do something

300
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:06,015
When Alan goes to the Boston railroads there like we observe ettore and that's what we're going

301
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
Keep doing

302
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
Sorry William Baldwin

303
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
So then

304
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
I'll go to Harvard

305
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,439
Any astronomers there are like a great idea

306
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
Will adopt.

307
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
So then the Boston Railroad

308
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,327
And the city government of Boston agree to accept

309
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
The new standard

310
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,191
Ben Allen does New York New York

311
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
Boston did this

312
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,335
You better do it too or else the railroad time might come to be known as quote

313
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
Boston

314
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Time

315
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,943
And you're like oh my God you're right we are on

316
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
But

317
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,295
The Attorney General of the United States

318
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,111
Looks at Allen's plan and is like weight

319
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:47,487
The railroads want to tell everyone in the whole country what time it is

320
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
No

321
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,559
Only Congress can do something like that

322
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
Any orders

323
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,679
All the government agencies to ignore Allen and the railroads

324
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,567
Government business is going to be happening on good old-fashioned DC local time

325
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
What island does convince

326
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,735
Most of major cities in America to go with the railroads plan for Standard Time

327
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
And he's successful

328
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
So I wouldn't necessarily call it

329
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
Railroad time

330
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,927
What's more like William F Allen time

331
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
He would love to hear you say

332
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
I'm sure

333
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
I'm sure he would

334
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
So here is Allen's play

335
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,447
America is going to go from being a country where every town has its own time

336
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
To a country where there are

337
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
4

338
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Different

339
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
X

340
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Call them

341
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Time zone

342
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,431
And this new time era

343
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,759
Is going to begin on a single day

344
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
It's one of those things are you given exact date

345
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,855
November 18th 1883

346
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
We went on Standard Time

347
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,743
Alan has already done a lot of legwork like figuring out all the time changes

348
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
Rita's the train schedule

349
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Send out notices

350
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,119
Newspapers are announcing this so people can get ready

351
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
And everyone

352
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,495
The observatories the cities the railroad companies

353
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,823
Has agreed that local time will be abolished

354
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,151
And the new era of Standard Time Will begin

355
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
On Sunday

356
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
November 8th

357
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
Big moment

358
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Arrive

359
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
At noon

360
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
Which way does a simple question

361
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,951
How do you tell everyone when it's the new moon

362
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
At the break

363
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023

00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:16,223
Observatories around the country it would be watching the Sun in the sky to determine the exact

380
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Hot

381
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
For example the Naval Observatory in DC would be waiting for noon in the new Eastern Time Zone

382
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
At that moment

383
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:31,071
The Observatory would send out a pulse over the Western Union Telegraph line to announce

384
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
It's noon

385
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,423
That pulse would run up to New York

386
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
Where activated something called a

387
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
Time ball

388
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
There were time balls in a bunch of cities and

389
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
I

390
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Love this part

391
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,527
If you have ever seen the ball drop in Times Square on New Year's Eve you have seen a Time ball that is like a call back to this 19th

392
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
Centra technology

393
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,599
And what it was is there would be

394
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
These balls

395
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,415
That would sit up on like

396
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,719
Pools on the top of tall building

397
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,791
And they were designed to fall the instant a telegraph Pole

398
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,607
So everybody would know exactly what time it was

399
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,935
And they would gather around the time ball and set

400
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
At their watches

401
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
And ships at

402
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,567
See you would see a ball and be like set the chronometer everyone

403
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,383
And that's the way that they Coordinated Time Okay so

404
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
In New York

405
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
There was a time ball on the roof

406
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Of the Western Union.

407
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
So

408
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,831
On the morning of November 18th

409
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,671
That is where William Allen and his family went to wait

410
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
4 News

411
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,047
People around the city we're staring up at this time ball end

412
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
According to some newspapers they were nervous

413
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Like

414
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
Is this going to work

415
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
Are there going to be train crashes

416
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:44,031
The noon of New York's local time arrived about

417
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
4 minutes

418
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
Before

419
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,663
The new Nerf standard so the bells of one Church

420
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
Rain at

421
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,247
The true local time

422
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
And then

423
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
4 minutes later

424
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,623
Pulse goes out from the Naval Observatory

425
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,695
Alan and his family see the time ball drop

426
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Right now

427
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
And it's noon

428
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
Again

429
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,375
People would come to call this the day of

430
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
2 Nunes

431
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
But this

432
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
Second moon

433
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,007
Wasn't just noon in New York

434
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
It was noon in Boston

435
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
And Philadelphia

436
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
And Charles

437
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:27,551
And this new noon it's our new its they are now on our time back to 1883

438
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,647
And just the same way there's an Eastern Time Zone and it's noon and I'm sitting down in California

439
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
Is going to be noon

440
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
It's noon

441
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Same time

442
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
We are living in William Allen's world

443
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
William a Fallon realize

444
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
That

445
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
Time is not just

446
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,983
Some objective measurement of where the sun is in the sky

447
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,311
Is also about the needs of

448
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Society

449
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,711
And the railroads had created a society that needed a new kind of time

450
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,783
On the day of two noons by the way

451
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
Everything went fine

452
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:06,207
Some people didn't even notice the change didn't bother to change their clocks until weeks later there are no records of trains colliding on the tracks

453
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,743
It turned out to be kind of like white

454
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
UK

455
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,815
The next day the Attorney General

456
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,375
The one who's been so against William Allen

457
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
Big-time plan

458
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,983
He was supposed to take the express train from DC

459
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Philadelphia

460
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:24,895
People say this story is apocryphal but the Chicago Tribune wrote at the time that the Attorney General

461
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
Quote

462
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,503
Walks down the platform leisurely with his watch and hand

463
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,343
Define that he arrived about 8 minutes and 12 seconds

464
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Too late

465
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,671
The railroads are gone ahead without him

466
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:42,047
Emperor wild of course there were a few holdouts against this system as there always are

467
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
A few towns who just

468
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
Love their local time

469
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:51,519
And the federal government did not officially adopt Standard time until 1918

470
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,871
They didn't technically abolish localtime until 1966

471
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
But of course by then

472
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,503
Everybody was already operating on Standard Time

473
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,575
Has Richard white told me at the railroad said look

474
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,879
You can go buy whatever time you want

475
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
But not

476
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,439
If you want to make your train

477
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:16,607
