16
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,832
Thanks for calling plan of money this is Karen how can I help you

17
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,136
I was booking a flight

18
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,696
And one of the cheapest flights

19
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,768
British Airways and I clicked on it and

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,424
The entire flight cost $516 and they said that $514 were for taxes

21
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,496
And let the fear itself cost $2

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,848
And I immediately thought that this doesn't make any economic sense

23
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
Okay so

24
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:24,480
The question we got from our listener is basically how can you have

25
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,016
An airline flight that is

26
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,112
$516 and only two of it be for the flight and the rest

27
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
$514

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
Before taxes and fees

29
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
Which is why we have called in

30
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,256
Julia Furlan

31
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,304
I believe that you looked into this for us

32
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,888
Yep I took this question and I call the guy named Bob man

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,960
And he's an airline industry expert he knows a lot

34
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,752
He's been in the industry for like 40 years

35
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,312
The history of it is actually that it comes from a

36
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Fuel star

37
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Charge

38
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
In 2008

39
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
Fuel prices were really high

40
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
So Airlines

41
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
Put this like taxes

42
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,528
These thing into their fare breakdown

43
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,320
So there was a fuel surcharge

44
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
But then fuel prices

45
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
Has went down

46
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,440
And guess what the airlines didn't do

47
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,536
They didn't take away the taxes and fees that is not cool I know right

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,424
Pacific to British Airways either any Airline can break down their Fair kind of however they want and there is

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,032
Some amount of monitoring from the Department of Transportation but it's kind of random it's not good

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,944
All right that's one question down but there are a lot to go so let's dive in hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm

77
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
Thank you for calling Planet Money help desk this is Julia Furlan speaking how many my name is Solis Barrow and

78
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,592
My question is why

79
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,920
Vanilla prices have gone up so dramatically over the left

80
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
Little while I went

81
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
Takako

82
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
It's been over a year but

83
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,624
I paid 599 for 16 oz of vanilla and then

84
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
I went back and it was

85
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
999

86
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,375
$32 for the same thing over the course of a year

87
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
Why is this happening

88
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,823
Okay so we sent this question over to our sweet tooth producer Alexi Horowitz Ghazi Alexi why did the price of vanilla rice

89
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
For the past couple of year

90
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,455
First I'll say that vanilla gets kind of a bad rap for being really bored

91
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
But

92
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
After a little bit of research

93
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
Kind of falling for vanilla

94
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
What turns up

95
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
A little bit mad

96
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
What did you find out

97
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
First thing I found out somehow I never knew this

98
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
Vanilla actually comes

99
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
From a beautiful orchid

100
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
Why they left

101
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,959
I didn't know that end in the 19th century the French transplanted vanilla to several of its colonies in East

102
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Including

103
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
Madagascar

104
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
Which

105
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,847
Turns out has a great climate for growing vanilla

106
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
The only problem

107
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,711
The insects that pollinate vanilla orchids in their native habitats

108
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
Do not live in Madagascar

109
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
So they have to be hand pollinated

110
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
One by one with like a little toothpick stick

111
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,207
It's super time-consuming and labor-intensive

112
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
And

113
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,303
Vanilla flowers only bloom one day a year

114
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
What

115
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
So the timetable can get pretty crunched

116
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
Delicate price

117
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
That is so well I can't decide if this

118
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,799
Extremely dark or extremely miraculous

119
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,895
And because Madagascar has become the main source of the world's natural vanilla

120
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
Up to 80%

121
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,223
The rest of us can often feel the fluctuations

122
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Intercrop

123
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
At the ice cream store when we buy beijing

124
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
King supplies

125
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Right that makes

126
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:50,719
For decades that wasn't really that big of a problem because vanilla buyers could just supplement that Supply with

127
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
Synthetic

128
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Vanillin

129
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,839
A much cheaper lab-produced version of the plants

130
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Essential ingredient

131
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,423
But what happened recently that made the prices go up

132
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Well a couple of

133
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
First public taste begin to shift

134
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:08,383
Closer to getting more and more into natural ingredients instead of artificial flavors

135
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,455
In 2015 Nestle and Hershey's and other companies

136
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
Announce that they're going to switch from synthetic

137
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,807
Back to all natural vanilla

138
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,391
Which of course contributes to this huge spike in demand

139
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
And the price is going up

140
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,999
I wasn't there also like a hurricane in Madagascar

141
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Recently that

142
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
Like wiped out a lot of

143
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,911
Crop someone on a tropical Cyclone hit Madagascar in 2017

144
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,983
Damaged one of the main vanilla producing regions of the country

145
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
And that made prices go even higher

146
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
And that's why I shalisa

147
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
Pay more at the register at Costco

148
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:46,783
Yes along with all of the ice cream junkies and Candy freaks of the world

149
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Thank you

150
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,815
And how many listener service this is Karen how can I help you

151
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:03,423
Hi Planet Money this is Justin Lee and I want to know what's the economics of those

152
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
We Buy Houses signs

153
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,263

154
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Thanks so much

155
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
We turned this one over to Jake

156
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
Goldstein and

157
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,967
Disappeared for a couple of days and came back with this

158
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Special Report

159
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
Jacob I am delighted

160
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
To take this question

161
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Because

162
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
In just the past few years.

163
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
We Buy Houses

164
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
Has been

165
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Wetransfer

166
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
Formed in a really in

167
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
It used to be

168
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:35,679
Largely local businesses posting their phone numbers on telephone poles by in a few fixer uppers from people who are in a

169
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
Today

170
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,263
It is billion dollar tech companies

171
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:43,615
Buying thousands of homes that are in perfectly good shape from people who are doing

172
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
I talked about this shift with Glenn kelman

173
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,295
He's the CEO of Redfin this big sort of hybrid tech company real estate broker

174
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:56,159
And he told me about the first time somebody suggested that his company Redfin

175
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
Should get into the We Buy Houses

176
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
And then you know what I said

177
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
I'm too chicken

178
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
I won't do it

179
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
Courses

180
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
You have to put you know

181
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,935
Hundreds of millions of dollars on the line

182
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
Betting that Redfin could buy houses

183
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,311
Turn around and quickly sell them for a small profit

184
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
This is legitimately terrifying

185
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
But when told me

186
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,967
That would you intimate Terror notwithstanding

187
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
There were these

188
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,343
Three big changes that finally persuaded him and a bunch of other companies to get into this

189
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
The first is that

190
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
People who sell houses through redis

191
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,351
Are having a time getting a money fast enough to buy their next place in other words you're selling your house

192
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
You want to buy a new house

193
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
But after the financial

194
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,239
Crisis it's a lot harder to get a mortgage for the new house

195
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
Before you sold your old house

196
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,359
So there is this new group of people who could afford to make a move

197
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
But they just can't make the timing work

198
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
That is change number one

199
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,991
Change number to is computers

200
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
Algorithms technology

201
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,111
Companies like Redfin are building these algorithms that are really good

202
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Estimating home

203
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
And then change number three

204
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
Is investors all around the world

205
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,815
Start throwing gobs of money

206
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
At tech companies

207
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
It was so much money

208
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
And it seem so easy to get

209
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,959
That it even surprised Glenn kehlmann

210
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
The CEO of a tech

211
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
Redfin

212
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
Got a call

213
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,663
From somebody representing Saudi Arabian money or Kuwaiti money

214
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,735
And then he said I've got a problem

215
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
I have all this money

216
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
And I need

217
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
To deploy it

218
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
He just wanted to give it to us

219
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,951
And that's what I felt like something really deep

220
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
Fundamental

221
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,047
Was changing in the global economy

222
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,631
Soap companies that have build algorithms to estimate home

223
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
Are now

224
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Flush with money

225
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,543
And can use that money to start buying houses from home sellers who need money

226
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
Finally Glenn tells his employees

227
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
It is time to do

228
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,455
I think the subject of the email with something like

229
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,759
Strap on the Viking helmet

230
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
Go forth and conquer

231
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,855
They're mostly buying moderately-priced home

232
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,159
In subdivisions with lots of identical house

233
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
Because that makes it easier to

234
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
So if you live in a house

235
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Like that

236
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
You can go online

237
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
Enter some details about your house

238
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
And in a few hours or a day

239
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,447
Get a cash offer from Redfin or one of his camp

240
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,519
Fast and easy but there is a trade-off

241
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
You probably will wind up getting

242
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
A few percent less

243
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
Then if you sold your house the old fashioned

244
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
Several other companies are getting into this

245
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
As well

246
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
Zillow Keller Williams

247
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
The one buying the most houses

248
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:36,927
It's called open door they have raised billions of dollars in debt and equity and around 10

249
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Housing houses

250
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Last year

251
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,023
Glenn says he can imagine

252
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
That's something like

253
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,863
10% of people might someday sell their home

254
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
And that is

255
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Enough to be a little bit scary

256
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
I think it's a new thing in the economy

257
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
And if I had to pick

258
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
People

259
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
2

260
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Make

261
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
Prudent bats

262
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
At the casino tables

263
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
Hack people wouldn't

264
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,295
Be that I remind myself would not

265
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,367
I just remind myself every night

266
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,719
If you look at the history of subprime you see people making a ton of money in that

267
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Space

268
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,559
And other players getting drawn into it one by one

269
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,351
And it proved to be their demise

270
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Because

271
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Yeah you chase

272
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Prophets

273
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
You follow the customer

274
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Over a cliff

275
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,103
And yeah we're trying to be the one to beat those odds

276
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:35,039
Please hold for the next procrastinating

277

279
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Hi

280
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
Hey I was wondering

281
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,863
Why a barrel of oil is 42 gallons

282
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,703
I'm not around number like 40 or 50

283
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Chamberlain is that you

284
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,639
Kenny I recognize your voice come on let's get in the studio

285
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
ILearn

286
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,831
Make the phone call okay. Crime okay I great

287
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,415
Reporter Kenny Malone what is the thing that you absolutely must have

288
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
A barrel of oil

289
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
Is 42 gallons and that is a weird number

290
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
It's not 40

291
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
And it's not V

292
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,375
And I learned why it is 42

293
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
On a reporting trip

294
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
Earlier this year

295
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
Reporter Julia Simon

296
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
Went to Titusville

297
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Is the middle of the winter

298
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
This is the sound of a snowball

299
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
At the birthplace of the modern oil industry

300
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,783
Titusville is where America's first commercial oil well was

301
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
And I was back in the 1800s

302
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Now

303
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,647
There's an oil Museum

304
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Which is where we met

305
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
A curator named Sue Bates

306
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,279
To Julia noticed was wearing earrings shaped like oil

307
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,863
Oh I did that sound like little silver oil derrick

308
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
All about oil here

309
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
Sasu did explain to us that

310
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,263
In the 1800 oil people

311
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,567
Did in fact want to send and receive

312
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,615
A nice round 40 gallons

313
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Problem

314
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,711
Which of these barrels were going to have to be pulled by horses

315
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
On crappie

316
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
Rocky Roads

317
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
And so

318
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
It was cited

319
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,135
That they would build in an extra 2 gal

320
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,999
And that ensured that 40 gallons would arrive at the refinery

321
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
It allowed to gallons for leakage

322
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Right

323
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,935
Yeah yeah apparently there's oil all over the roads in this area Splash and spilling out

324
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
Gross

325
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,751
It is also worth noting that

326
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Barrel makers apparently

327
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
Used to this 42-gallon size they have been

328
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,407
Making booze in barrels the size for a long time

329
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
I may be also

330
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,783
Answer the question a modern barrel of oil is 42 gallons

331
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Because

332
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367

333
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135

So what are the cost of being tall

Hi Greg hey Julia what you got for us

363
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
So I talked to Jacob and he

364
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
He told me all about the

365
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
The cost of being tall

366
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,487
First clothes cost more everything I own shoes

367
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
Socks pants shirts

368
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,887
Ties everything is special order this cost like food dye wood

369
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:39,263
Naturally assumed I ate more than in an average human and then there are costs that have nothing to do with money

I feel like every time I go to a concert there's somebody who's like

373
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
11 ft tall with big head

374
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,903
That guy I know so turns out there's actually a lot of studies about

375
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,975
But they're not about the cost of being told they're all about the Ben

376
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
So study after study

377
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Spell gnat like

378
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,655
Call people on average they are better educated or happier and beardmore

379
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,727
In fact an influential study a few years back found

380
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
4 in increasing height

381
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
Was associated with

382
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
Average earnings boost of about 9

383
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,151
9% 9

384
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,991
Why is that we're coming to be about like why there's

385
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
Earnings premium for 12

386
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
People

387
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:28,159
Influential study and they explained it basically by breaking down how tall

388
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
People get tall

389
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,279
There's the science like you know your jean Seabiscuit by Greg have.

390
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
Potential to become a certain height

391
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,399
C511 okay okay for the nurture kicks in

392
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,215
If you get good nutrition and vaccinations

393
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,543
Send good Medical Care growing up you'll probably hit that potential

394
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Your total height growth

395
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
And here is the important part

396
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Your brain also

397
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,319
People who reach their Highest Potential also tends to reach their brain potential

398
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:02,719
Great that's basically like the takeaway from the study and we should save these people who grow up in these nurturing environment

399
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
And get all these benefits

400
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
They also tend to be more at 4

401
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
It's just like us

402
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,351
Super Advantage Psych

403
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
They get better schools

404
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Food

405
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
They get better High

406
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
They got better money

407
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,775
Exactly okay but as somebody who grew up with good

408
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
Schools but is51

409
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
Are you telling me that I am not operating at

410
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,247
Performance of this study

411
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,319
You can't just like take Jacob who's 6 a.m.

412
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,855
They therefore he's smarter than you

413
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,647
These are just averages like if you

414
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,231
You take all the tall people's earnings and average that they earn more

415
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,303
And besides you're clearly brilliant so you obviously

416
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
Reached her genetic

417
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
Thank you so much Gray

418
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:48,031
Sure

419
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,103
All of our reporters are assisting other listeners

420
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,175
Please leave your question after the tone and it will be Google

421
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735
I mean answered in the order it was received

422
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:02,367
Hi my name is hello Wisner I'm from Albany New York

423
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
And I've been having problems

424
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
Focusing at work

425
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
And I was wondering

426
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
If Ethan's effect

427
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
Workplace productivity

428
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,447
So far our very last question Julia and I

429
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Enlisted the help of our

430
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
Plastic intern Rachel Cohn

431
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,127
She's amazing hero of the fields I think so oh my God

432
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
This is like too much pressure

433
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
So the question is like

434
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,759
Do you work better in the

435
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,295
The summer or the winter

436
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,367
I think that's right I think they're wondering like

437
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
Especially now that it's spring

438
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
Am I being less

439
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Productive

440
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
And there isn't a lot of research

441
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
On season

442
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
But I did find this one study

443
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,423
From researchers were at Harvard and UNC

444
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Chapel Hill

445
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
And what they did is they look

446
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
At how weather affects

447
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
Productivity

448
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
Specifically they were studying the productivity

449
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
People who are doing

450
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Data entry

451
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
So this might be different

452
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
For people who are in

453
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Rita fields

454
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,319
What they did is they collected two years worth of data from a bank

455
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Bank in Japan

456
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,671
And they looked at you know how long it took workers their day after day

457
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,719
To enter information into a

458
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
And what they found

459
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327
Was that for every 1 inch of rain

460
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
People were 1.3%

461
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Faster

462
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
I completed

463
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,263
So basically bad weather was good for Prada

464
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,591
I know right

465
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,687
And you don't 1.3% might not sound like a lot on an individual

466
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,735
Put across the whole Bank

467
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
That can make a big difference

468
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
I think about what that could mean when it

469
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
Sunny outside

470
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
Businesses might be losing 1 Point

471
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
3% of the productivity

472
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
All of their workers

473
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,351
The researchers in this study estimated that 1.3% loss in product

474
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,911
Would translate to a loss in Revenue

475
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
Of 9

476
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
37000

477
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
$500 a year

478
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Yo million bucks

479
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,847
That's not nothing just a million dollars

480
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,895
Okay simple what are you do like we can't

481
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
I can't personally

482
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,015
Control the weather I did speak to one of the researchers involved with the

483
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Study

484
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
And she suggested that businesses

485
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
Put just let

486
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,159
People go home early on sunny days

487
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:19,071
You know an acknowledgement of the fact that were less productive and we'll make up for it when it's raining I love is I think

488
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,655
Study and I think that on behalf of NPR and our list

489
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
We should probably just

490
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,775
Animal science toilets
