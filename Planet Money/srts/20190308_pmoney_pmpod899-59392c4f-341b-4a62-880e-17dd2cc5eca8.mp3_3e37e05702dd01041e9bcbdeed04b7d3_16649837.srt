1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,328
Okay so did you see it

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,120
Iceland

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,656
So what was it

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,960
It was a blanket with a message on

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,264
A blanket with a mess

6
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,080
And the blanket was hanging from a bridge

7
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,128
In the state of Guanajuato in Mexico

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,944
Do usually send messages like this

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,968
They right

10
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,760
Messages on blankets

11
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,528
Yes

12
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:26,880
And the hondaman cities with the very foul language

13
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,440
Terrible spelling

14
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,328
This is Manuel Milano he's an economist in Mexico with the Mexican Institute for competitiveness

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
This is

16
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,680
What are we usually call a narco Manta

17
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:43,520
Which has a blanket that hash

18
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:48,384
Some sort of warning medical Manta a drug trafficker

19
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,664
Blanket

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,968
Basically a billboard from the drug cartel

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,552
Journalism Mexico has stopped reporting on these blankets because

22
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,832
Didn't want to spread messages

23
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,600
The cartels

24
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,880
They are

25
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,416
Legitimately frightening

26
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,304
But this time the Fred is directly against the president of the are Republican.

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072
What's the weather

28
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
Andres Manuel Lopez obrador

29
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,656
This was addressed

30
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,448
To the president

31
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
Of Mexico

32
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,288
And it was signed by a criminal called alma mater

33
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
The hammer

34
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,640
Technically instead Elsinore tomorrow which would mean

35
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Mister

36
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
Hammer

37
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,456
The blanket said

38
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,736
President of

39
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,296
I demand you get your Navy

40
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,112
Army Air Force and federal police

41
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
Out of this

42
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,672
If not

43
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
I'm going to start killing

44
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
Innocent people

45
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,536
And then kind of like a PS it says

46
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
I've left you a little gift

47
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
At my refine

48
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
That little gift

49
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
Was an orange

50
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
Pickup truck

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
With what looked

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,008
Like a bomb inside

53
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,104
And the part of the message that says my Refinery he needs an oil refinery

54
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
Like we're gasoline

55
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,456
The refinery is owned by the Mexican governor

56
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,016
But the hammer is saying here no no no

57
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
That refinery

58
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
Is mine

59
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,720
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Sarah Gonzales

60
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,328
Play on the show the hammer and a lot of drug traffickers and cartels

61
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Are diversifying

62
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,168
They're getting into the oil business

63
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,496
Killing billions of dollars of gasoline

64
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,520
Every year

65
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,616
The president of Mexico is taking radical even dangerous steps

66
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
To cut them off

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272

Just a quick warning this show includes audio from a deadly accident

80
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
It is disturbing

81
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,544
Okay the first thing you should know about gasoline in Mexico is that it

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,920
State-owned the national Oil Company petroleos Mexicanos is one of the largest oil companies

83
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
In the world

84
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Everyone calls it

85
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
Baymax and pemex gasoline

86
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,856
Is really expensive for people in Mexico like you have to work almost

87
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,904
Full day at minimum wage

88
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
In order to afford

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
One gallon of gasoline

90
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,792
And as a result people have always stolen Sun gas in next

91
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
There's even a special name for stole

92
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,888
Everybody calls it what you got

93
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448
But for a long time it was kind of a a manageable

94
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,080
Until a few years ago when drug cartels wanted to diversify beyond the drug business

95
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,872
Some turn to prostitution

96
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
Some started kidnapping

97
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
People for ransom

98
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,784
And some look at this little watch equal thing and we're like

99
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
We can make this a much

100
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
Bigger business

101
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,160
Billions of dollars of gasoline is

102
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Flowing

103
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
Right at our

104
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,352
So they started tapping the gasoline pipelines and they are selling stolen gas into this

105
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Giant

106
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
Global Market

107
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:55,008
It's hurt you talked about the global market with Ian Rowdy he works for the United Nations

108
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,080
His job is fighting Maritime fuel smuggling

109
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
Which

110
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Basically means that he fights

111
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:05,248
Pirates he's a pirate by Pirates

112
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,296
Pirates Smugglers traffickers and thieves

113
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
Are you ever scared

114
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,416
Yeah I Meister fight about this interview

115
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,512
When you're talking about doing the benefits of criminal profit

116
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,607
People go to links to keep that invites crime that happened in the ocean

117
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,447
And he says that one of Mexico's most notorious cartels

118
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
Is that a full on

119
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,055
Fuel exporter they have fake export certificates

120
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
And in in Tiger

121
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
Fleet

122
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
Of ships in the sea

123
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,711
They have tankers they have Supply vessels their support vessels

124
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
And they can

125
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,087
Take fuel right from the refinery put into a tanker

126
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135
With falsified documents and then

127
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
Tell it right in two

128
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
Somebody's pork and

129
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
Distributed as if it was a legitimate

130
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,143
Shipping vessels filled with fuel that is being sold all over the world stolen Mexican fuel sold all over the world

131
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,703
How can you sell

132
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
Stolen

133
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,311
Fuel smuggled out of Mexico to like Thailand

134
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,967
Well if you probably wouldn't sell it to Thailand because they're there their smuggling it in by fishing

135
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,295
Boats from Malaysia and then selling it and Coke bottles on the street

136
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,623
So Thailand's Got itself

137
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
Don't Dynamic that you would you could even tell it into Caribbean countries into other South American countries into

138
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,119
Parts of Europe in North America

139
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
What is this massive Global Indus

140
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,495
All of the supply chains going from country to Country

141
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,359
And the different ways people come up with the steel gasoline is just

142
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,663
Encryptstick Morocco and Algeria

143
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,223
Facebook closed border people are not allowed to

144
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,807
To walk across drive across people cannot cross the border

145
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
But

146
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,135
Donkeys can

147
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
Like

148
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Trained

149
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
Unmanned

150
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Donkeys

151
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
And as a result

152
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,071
Donkeys have been taking overnight

153
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,679
Jerry cans with Algerian fuel across the border into Morocco 4 years

154
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,495
And if you think that's just a small-scale think

155
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,335
Come to the total adds up to about 2 billion dollars a year

156
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
My donkey

157
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
Injury can

158
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,735
So there's this extraordinary Global Market in stolen gas

159
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,063
Once the cartels in Mexico discovered this

160
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
They just started stealing more and more

161
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:24,767
In 2016 spamax Mexico's Oil Company lost 1.5 billion dollars

162
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
2 stolen gas

163
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,143
Then 2.5 billion dollars the next year and 3.5 billion dollars

164
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,215
Last year that's 9 million dollars a day

165
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:38,335
Nginx stealing from a private company they're stealing from the Mexican Government

166
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,895
From the people of Mexico

167
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
Today's problems getting worse

168
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
And then on December 1st of last

169
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
You're just a few months ago

170
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
A new president was for

171
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,367
Andres Manuel Lopez obrador

172
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
Name is a handful so everybody calls

173
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,767
And Manuel The Economist says he's just a different kind of

174
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,863
I'm not traveled around Mexico without Secret Service

175
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
And to save the people money

176
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
He flies

177
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
Commercial like a regular

178
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
Diesel

179
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
Fearless man

180
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,223
I have to give him that he's really Fearless his first day as president he said he was going to sell all the play

181
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,527
Planes and all the helicopters that the quote

182
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Corrupt

183
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
Politicians use

184
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
He came in

185
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
To change things up in Mexico

186
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,975
He has an idea power

187
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,071
Closer to that of Aztec Emperors on the IV thing

188
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,679
He projects that image that he's in control and

189
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Can

190
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Achieve

191
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,775
Absolutely anything

192
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:45,663
Just enough willpower and so on December 27th just a few weeks after he became president

193
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
Imma hold this Prescott

194
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
All about spelling

195
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
Combative

196
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,415
Oromo come on this is a multi-billion Dollar business

197
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,975
Of course people at pemex know this is going on

198
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,303
They know when someone has punched a hole in a pipeline and is

199
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
Siphoning gasoline

200
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,679
The people in the government know this is happening to obviously

201
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
They are letting it happen

202
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
The authorities

203
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Are complicit

204
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,407
Go la complicidad this stolen gas this what you called is from the top

205
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
What you call

206
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Federal

207
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
Does that leave ER

208
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
And then he says

209
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Right now

210
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
We have to end this corrupt

211
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Como esta Kuroshio

212
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,255
And then he does something that nobody has ever tried

213
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
Before something

214
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Rap God

215
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
Amlo

216
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,167
Shut down the gasoline pipelines in

217
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
Turned off the valves

218
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Dried out the pipes

219
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,287
No more gasoline flowing

220
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,847
So even if the cartels cut them

221
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
There be nothing in there

222
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
He was taking on the cartels

223
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
The only problem is

224
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
He shut off the valves

225
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
To the pipeline

226
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,903
Like the thing that brings gasoline to millions of

227
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,975
People in Mexico imagine you're living your life and then one day

228
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,535
I don't know where the president is like sorry

229
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
Turning up the supply of gasoline.

230
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Fighting crime

231
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,727
Technically still gasoline in Mexico but now instead of flowing through pipes

232
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,055
Gasoline was moving in trucks and rail cars

233
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
Traveling by police

234
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
Escort well

235
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,711
Of course I'm an economist and I'm worried

236
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,759
The best way to move

237
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,087
Liquids used through a pipe

238
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,367
The cheapest way

239
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,439
It cost 14 times more to move gas by truck

240
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
Then by pipeline

241
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
According to the max

242
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,815
And also and more importantly in the short-term in Mexico

243
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
It is a much

244
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
Much slower way of getting gas

245
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,959
So after almost shut off the pipes

246
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,519
Guess just couldn't get the gas station fast

247
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
Millions of people who just wanted to let you know drive to work

248
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
Car pick up their kid at school had to wait

249
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
5 hours

250
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,687
8 hours

251
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
It's just a put gas in their car taxi drivers truck drivers farmers

252
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
They couldn't move their product

253
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,951
The price of fruit and meat and vegetables went out

254
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
And people stayed home

255
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
It was like a natural disaster

256
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
That hit Mexico

257
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,375
Eventually gas stations ran out in Thai

258
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Even in Mexico City

259
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
In the capital

260
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
For more than a month

261
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
There were shortages

262
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,799
People started fighting with gasoline

263
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:25,151
So the president had cut his own people off from this essential resource

264
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
And yet

265
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
He was still really Poppy

266
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
90% of the country

267
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
Supported him

268
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,367
Turning off the pipes they wanted him to fight Gaston

269
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,975
And people started getting used to waiting in long lines for gasoline

270
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,047
And you know when there are a lot of Mexicans to

271
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,119
Just waiting hours and hours for one thing

272
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
We're going to we're going to turn it into a party

273
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
A few pipelines were still running

274
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,991
One ran through in Alfalfa field in a farm town called

275
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,575
And of course when so many pipes are dry

276
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,391
Gas thieves are going to find the one that's running

277
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
And on January 18th

278
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
Some Gatsby

279
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,559
This one and the gasoline started leaking

280
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,351
Forming some sort of pain.

281
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Of gasoline

282
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:22,239
This is a very small Lepore rutile town

283
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
In N Central Mex

284
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,919
So people started flowing to these place

285
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
In order to get

286
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,759
5 l

287
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
10

288
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:40,927
Hundreds of people like 700 people women children grandparents

289
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Showed up

290
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Bucket

291
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
Monsters there

292
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
Scooping up

293
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
Spilled gasoline

294
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
And then some soldiers came

295
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
They trying to get everybody to me

296
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
How to get everybody to stop you

297
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,959
But they were outnumbered people just

298
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,543
At some point that day the leak turned into a gusher

299
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
Gas started shooting up into the air

300
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
50K

301
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,431
There videos of this online people are getting

302
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Covered in gasoline

303
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
So

304
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,831
I mean this is the kind of happiness you would find in

305
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,927
American scenes of kids in a very hot summer

306
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,023
Gathering around the broken

307
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
Fireman

308
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Connection

309
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Riley kids

310
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
Around a fire hydrant

311
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
Yes

312
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
Event that happened in Mexico

313
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,519
No I don't think so

314
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
To secede from Americana apus

315
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
I mean that's how

316
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,711
Look up first nanny

317
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
Just became

318
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Dnieper

319
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:46,719
Something cause a spark and everything burst into flames

320
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,119
16 from hell it's just something that

321
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
You cannot fathom you cannot imagine

322
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
Furious

323
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:03,871
Table counting and people running from one side to the other

324
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
In flames

325
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,951
People are in flames

326
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,767
Rolling around in the Alfalfa field trying to

327
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
Put out the fire

328
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
Taking off all their

329
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
Close their shoes

330
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Begging

331
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
For help

332
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Dozens of people were

333
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
Really badly burnt

334
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,031
Kids lost their limbs people's faces

335
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
Completely changed from the Burns

336
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,895
And more than 130 people

337
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Workouts

338
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
That night

339
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
The president went to the scene of the Explorer

340
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,623
He offered his condolences to the victims and their families

341
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
And then a reporter asked him

342
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,487
Does this mean you're going to change the way your fighting gas

343
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,583
No he said no

344
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
Merchant

345
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,679
But to help with the shortages

346
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:05,311
I know spent almost a hundred million dollars on 571 new trucks

347
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
That he bought from the United

348
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,687
He has also turned most of the gas pipelines back on

349
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,503
But there are thousands of soldiers guarding the pie

350
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Out there right now

351
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,159
So gasoline is getting two people again but at a really high cost

352
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
And guess that

353
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
Is down

354
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,047
Ian the pirate fighter and fuel theft expert says

355
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,607
It probably won't last

356
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
Criminals

357
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,519
Are incredibly creative remember Coke bottles and.

358
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
Oil or fuel

359
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
You're just going to see a change in the modalities of how it

360
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Stolen

361
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,991
Shifting from pipelines to trucks just means that you're shifting from tapping pipelines to

362
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Hijacking tanker trucks

363
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,599
Ultimately and says you don't solve

364
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
The problem by

365
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,671
Turning off the pipes or by moving oil

366
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
Out of pipes and ink

367
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
Trucks

368
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,023
You solve it by arresting people who

369
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,375
Stihl gasoline and resting corrupt officials who let them get away with it

370
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911
Until you do that

371
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
People will keep stealing

372
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,591
Why wouldn't they

373
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,199
4 pemex officials have been arrested including the man who's in charge

374
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
One of the most important gas pipelines in Mexico he's accused of looking the other way when he knew criminals were Steel
