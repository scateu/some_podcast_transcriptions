What lizards of Planet Money

51
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
Really

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
Want to know

53
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,128
What is the number one question you get over and over again through the years

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
And I'll tell you what the quest

55
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,968
Disinfect this time it was

56
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
Chad Rohde

57
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
And the question is

58
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,624
Hey you know if you ever seen a coupon in tiny print

59
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
Ulta coupon it says cash value

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
Cash value 1

61
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
100

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
Avocet

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Who is asking

64
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,168
What does that mean can you actually get tired of a truckload

65
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,496
Of coupons together and get real money could you buy a house if you

66
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
You had

67
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
Enough coupons

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,176
I think you would probably be able to build a house out of coupons before you could actually buy one but

69
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Everyone

70
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
I kind of I think I have an answer for you

71
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,576
Okay where did this come from what is the deal with it

72
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
So

73
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
To answer this question I

74
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
What's the most obvious

75
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
This place I could

76
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
Imagine the coupon Institute

77
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
You're not

78
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,096
Far off the association of coupon professionals which

79
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,192
Is real and the executive director pick up the phone right away and he said

80
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
Cash value thing

81
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,336
We get this like every 6 months I really should have a file on hand

82
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Their butt

83
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,688
I don't at the moment but here's a phone number for someone who will

84
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
Know the answer

85
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
Hello

86
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
Jesus head

87
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
Yeses

88
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,880
This is Edward Quebec

89
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
The association of Nashua

90
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
Advertise

91
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,232
A&A

92
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,304
Right yeah of course the coupon cash value thing

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,656
Drive from the relationship to the old trading stamps

94
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
Oh these were I you know I am

95
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
Old enough to remember these

96
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
If you would get

97
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,056
A bunch of stamps when you bought a

98
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Productivity

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
Grocery store regular store whatever

100
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,432
And you put this into a buck and collecting stamps

101
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
And if you got enough of them

102
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
You could get like a like a

103
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:10,112
Oster Crock-Pot or a blender

104
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
Key Program

105
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
Four stores

106
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,976
That's right so so back when these programs were popular there

107
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
With some country

108
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,839
There wasn't like a lot of transparency around who actually benefited

109
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,911
And whether consumers were sort of being scammed

110
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,727
And so a number of different state legislature

111
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Pass laws it said

112
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,823
Did you want to do the program you need to put like some

113
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,407
Nominal cash value on the stamps so that like

114
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
If I don't really want to go buy a

115
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
Poster I can

116
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,759
Use the stamps and cash them in

117
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
For money

118
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,391
Makes sense but how did this get on coupons today you look but here for the

119
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,791
Magic of tea Celestial Seasonings $1 out it's Stacey Vanek Smith coupon

120
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:55,679
This is cash value .001 set how do I get from stamps to this thing

121
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
So

122
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
Train stamps were butts

123
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
Predecessor to

124
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
The coupon that we know now and

125
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,335
Because these laws are on the books it's

126
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
Easier to put that nominal cash value

127
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
Yuan the coupon then to

128
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Search by the laws

129
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,991
Did Hillary tell you if anyone

130
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,623
Uses this fine print and give cash back to the Go I mean of course I asked him about this like

131
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
How do I turn this

132
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Celestial Seasonings

133
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
Coupon in for its cash

134
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
Well that's another question

135
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
Procedure for that

136
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,935
That's Amore complex

137
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,775
It's just like so ludicrous that he hasn't even explored this option

138
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
But

139
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
Seems to me like

140
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
Worth exploring right

141
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,687
Thank you for calling Celestial Seasonings

142
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,503
We invite you to bring the perfect balance

143
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
To your day

144
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,367
Hey I got a very nice customer service rep named Grace

145
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:52,255
Yes how can I help you go through the same thing you know I've got this mint scented coupon from you guys at

146
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Worth a fraction

147
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Of a penny

148
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
How do I get

149
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
That money

150
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,911
Lake is there a way to do that I fat

151
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Never been asked

152
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
Before

153
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:06,079
Now that have you ever seen a coupon and wondered about the cash value thing yourself

154
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
I've never looked at the cash value

155
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Honestly

156
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Is very small

157
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,479
I'm going to look at it now and see how much

158
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
So

159
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
Grace Grace probably should try to get an answer but

160
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
I got this

161
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
This recording wechat

162
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
But I've already loaded up a truck

163
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,743
With ten thousand of these coupons headed

164
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:30,143
Towards Celestial Seasonings headquarters Kenny I actually think this is worth playing out for any Planet Money listeners

165
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Is it major thinking about give

166
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
Because like thinks

167
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
Think through this with us for

168
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
For just a second

169
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,847
Most of these coupons are worth 1/100 of a cent so

170
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
Like let's say you managed to Wrangle 10000 coupons you happen upon them laying around 10,000

171
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
The same manufacturer

172
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
You're going to package those up

173
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,463
How much would that even way Academy have to send them someplace and then you would get

174
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
$1

175
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
But you would be a coupon Legend

176
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:08,287
Thanks you're welcome

177
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
There's some questions that are timeless

178
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,855
The gaskets of over and over and over again and you start to suspect that there is no answer to this question

179
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
Is God real

180
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,487
That is not one of the questions Nick Fountain what is the quest

181
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,559
The question comes from Seth Engel of Oakland California

182
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,863
Why is rotisserie chicken so cheap

183
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
Seems like an unnatural bargain

184
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
What's the catch

185
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
Write this happen to me

186
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,007
Just this past weekend

187
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
I was shopping and I noticed

188
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
The rotisserie chicken no smell

189
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
Upgrade pal the spices on it already cooked

190
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
599 for the whole chicken

191
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,479
I walk around the corner to where the rock chickens are

192
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
They're more expensive

193
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
10 or 12 bucks

194
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,159
So why is it cheaper to have someone else do the roasting and all the work

195
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
For you

196
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
And my working here this Nick

197
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Is

198
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
That they're using old

199
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
Using expired

200
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Chickens

201
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
I thought that too

202
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:09,215
So I went to your local supermarket my local supermarket in Brooklyn Steve's C-Town

203
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
And I found Rudy Rivera he's the deli manager

204
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
My first big question

205
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,383
By the way this smells delicious

206
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Is

207
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
You sure that when

208
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
The meat department

209
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,831
Seeing that some chickens are going bad you sure they're not sending some over to you guys

210
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,647
Oh no we would never do that that's totally different chickens

211
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
I would never do it anyway

212
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Yunnan

213
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
I live

214
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,279
Around here and also

215
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
I shop here

216
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
I would never do that

217
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,935
I didn't quite believe him 100% but he was like

218
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,751
We're getting a delivery of them right now come out to the truck

219
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
Yeah

220
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
Mine

221
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
Zoo what does it say

222
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,247
He's pulling boxes of raw chicken off the truck

223
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
Can you bring some back to the cooler and he opens them up and shows me the

224
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
The vacuum sealed in there

225
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,511
Already seasoned what can I season Italian

226
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Plain & BBQ

227
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,863
To do they do a rub on the outside as well

228
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,399
Why did they inject them

229
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,191
Second day in Jack

230
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,751
Them that's the first thing I learned that's amazing

231
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
That is some high-level

232
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Chicken mating

233
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,383
Yeah it means that there's not that much labor that goes

234
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
It's right so

235
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
You think that you're getting such a deal out of these roaches

236
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,551
Three chickens to their like rubbing them and then they're putting them in there

237
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
And they're doing the dishes

238
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:35,231
No they're injected probably by a robot at a big Purdue Factory all Rudy have to do is show up at 6 a.m.

239
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
Put the chicken in the oven

240
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
Ant trap 3 hours later

241
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,607
Rudy is checking the temperature of the

242
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
It's already at 180

243
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
It's going 190

244
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
200

245
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
Boom

246
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Perfect

247
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
Take this cleanup

248
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
Took the boats outboard

249
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
Already got the prices on them

250
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
We put them in the heater

251
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
Are you going to do that right now

252
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Okay so I understand

253
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,463
Did Steve C-Town supermarket has a kind of assembly line thing going here they can do it for super cheap

254
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
599 still

255
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,631
Seems cheaper than what it would cost me to cook that chicken mites

256
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,287
Robert you are run you fell for the oldest trick in the supermarket play but you were just looking at the price of the whole chicken

257
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,591
Write the raw chicken in the rotisserie chicken

258
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,943
But what you didn't notice is the rotisserie chickens are really small

259
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
Little over two pounds

260
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,647
So rude and I we do the math it's a little bit complicated because the chickens was a little bit of weight when they're cooking but whatever

261
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,719
We figured out that the price for rotisserie chicken

262
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
Per pound is more expensive than the price

263
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Huaraches

264
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,887
So let me let me look at your calculations here

265
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,543
Customers are paying at least in our supermarket in Brooklyn customers are paying $0.06 more per pound for a rotisserie

266
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Chicken

267
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Then the rock chick

268
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,639
I know it's a small number 6 sense

269
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
So it's probably worth it for the convenience to

270
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
By the

271
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
Rotisserie chicken

272
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,319
But still it makes economic sense if the prepared food item

273
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
Cost more

274
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Then the Rock

275
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
Totally and

276
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,767
I did do a little more reporting than just going to our local supermarket I called at the USDA

277
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:18,143
They pointed me to this awesome chart the USDA National Retail report for chicken where they like

278
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,727
Look at every Supermarket circular that they can find an a

279
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
See what the advertised prices are

280
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,103
And Nationwide this difference is even more pronounced

281
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,151
What's the price per pound for whole bag

282
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
Fryers which is like what we would

283
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:37,087
About a buck per pound and the price for rotisserie chickens is around $2 in

284
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
$0.35

285
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Per pound

286
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Still worth it

287
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Totally

288
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
It's very convenient

289
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Thank you

290
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:49,119
Thanks

291
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
Answer some

292
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,711

Your questions here to Planet Money are not all

306
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Just fun

307
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Games

308
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
And roasted chicken

309
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
We have

310
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Serious

311
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:37,247
Probably econ students who demand answers to Serious economic questions with one of those questions

312
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Here now is

313
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,319
Julie Simon hey how's it going

314
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Let's hear the question

315
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
The question is

316
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
From Spence

317
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
Henderson in Birmingham Alabama

318
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Why are they

319
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
Swiss franc and Japanese Yen

320
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
Considered Safe Haven

321
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
During times of uncertainty

322
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
We should probably start by

323
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
Explain the term

324
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
Safe Haven

325
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
So in the case of

326
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Japan

327
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,031
Drain the great financial crisis when

328
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,335
People are panicked about banks around the world

329
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,895
The value of the Japanese Yen

330
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Went up

331
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,711
Money poured into Japan

332
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,295
And it happened again during the European financial crisis

333
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,855
Begotten waddup actually happened

334
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
Last

335
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
Month

336
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,951
With the stock market dipped around the world

337
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
The Japanese garden

338
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
What up

339
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,559
So Julia Y in times of crisis

340
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,887
Do people send their money to an island

341
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
In Asia

342
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,727
Right or a mountainous country in Europe like Switzerland

343
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
Will these countries have a lot going for

344
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,127
Japan and Switzerland they have stable economies

345
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,175
They have trustworthy institutions

346
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:43,039
Save a lot of money sloshing around

347
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
That's true

348
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,927
So I called up Jane Foley she's a foreign exchange expert at Rabobank

349
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,743
And I asked her why Japan and Switzerland are

350
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
So special

351
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
And she told me

352
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
That the thing about these country

353
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
Is that they have a lot of pee

354
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,191
People saving a lot of money

355
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
They got all the savers

356
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
Putting their money in

357
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Thanks

358
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,079
An investment plan

359
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
And in Good Times

360
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
This money goes all around the world

361
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,199
But when times get rough

362
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
The Japanese in the Swiss

363
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
They get scared

364
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
I generally what

365
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,623
Savers do when this times of crisis

366
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
Something bring that money

367
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
So all that money

368
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Comes back into

369
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:30,143
Meaning there is more demand for the Japanese Yen being the Japanese Yen value starts to go up

370
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,775
Yeah and people all around the world are saying hey look at the Japanese Yen why did I put my money over there

371
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
Until people all around the world

372
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Piling on

373
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
The longtime listeners a Planet Money may remember

374
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
That when your currency is strong

375
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
It's not

376
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Always

377
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
A good thing

378
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
For the

379
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
It is not always so great

380
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Because think about it

381
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,439
All those cool Japanese comic books or a Swiss Army knife

382
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,767
When the price of the Yen or the Swiss franc goes up

383
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
It's more

384
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
Expensive for people around the world

385
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
To buy those exports

386
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
So the Japanese

387
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
The Swiss

388
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,239
Be kind of resent being the safe haven currency

389
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,311
I was joking around with James Foley about

390
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,895
Can I give you an analogy do you think that this analogy works

391
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
That it's like

392
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,991
Being a designated driver

393
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
Ouu

394
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,135
Good in some ways because you're safe but you

395
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Can't have it

396
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Any fun

397
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Yes

398
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
If it is

399
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,535
What not. That was a load of responsibility

400
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,607
Angers you can't have any fun in it does limit

401
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
There

402
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Hello.

403
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,103
Plate well thank you Switzerland in Japan for being there for us I'm going to transfer my money there as we speak and thanks doing

404
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:50,271
Makes Robert Glenn

405
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
O'Sullivan

406
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
I was wondering

407
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
Why do most hotels

408
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Not have Shield

409
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,255
I have thought about this to you know you going to a hotel

410
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:04,351
And you turn on the light in me being a little entryway the light goes on

411
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,935
But the rest of the hotel room is dark and you have to wander around and

412
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
And figure out if

413
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,519
Light switch near the bulb

414
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
The bottom

415
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
Stumbling and tripping over things

416
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,919
This is a weird thing about hotel room so I talked to some architects

417
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
Lighting designers

418
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
And I have

419
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
3 amp

420
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
Answer number one

421
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
Lighting designers hate

422
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Ceiling light

423
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,463
They all talk about there's this one blurring light everyone looks bad in the Euro lighting

424
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,767
Designer so what you want is

425
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Bombilla

426
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Mood

427
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,607
So they want all of these table lamps

428
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Lighting and

429
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,447
And their first go to is to spread the lamps around the room

430
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
Which

431
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
Leave me

432
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,823
The answer number to why not connect all those lights with one switch

433
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
Answer number two is

434
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,407
Switches are

435
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Expensive

436
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
And the more switches

437
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,527
You have specially these 3-way switches you need to

438
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,855
Control everything the more money it cost and if you do nothing for the room

439
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
I can bust your budget

440
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,439
I swear on switches alone

441
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
And then

442
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
There's answer

443
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Number three

444
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,071
3 which I found fascinating

445
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
And she said you know if

446
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
A hotel room lights are driving you crazy

447
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,495
Because when you come right down to it

448
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
Lighting schemes

449
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,103
Are crazy they're not intuitive

450
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,711
I need to quit your old home for a second some lamps have switches at the top and some have

451
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
Floor switches

452
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
And some have Wall switches

453
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,319
But you already memorized that you don't think about it

454
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
Quick quick quick quick quick

455
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,159
All of a sudden your whole room is flooded with light

456
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,255
But the moment you walk to a hotel room or any unfamiliar place

457
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,911
You think you're going crazy cuz you have no idea which switch corresponds to what light you don't know how to get the light anywhere you

458
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
You wanted to be

459
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:49,311
Just making the point you know she hears he's complained all the time about lighting in the hotel room

460
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,895
And she said you're maybe it's just because you haven't spent enough time there

461
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
To get used to

462
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,711
Study figure out the system

463
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
You check out

464
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
And you moved on to the next one

465
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:04,415
Our next question is a quick one

466
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
And as nerdy

467
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
As a death in the economics world

468
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
Patty Hearst

469
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
The editor for

470
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
Decatur

471
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
Uber-nerd hello

472
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,423
So the question came from Bryan

473
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Knowles

474
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
And what's the question

475
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
So the question is

476
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,543
What is a giffen good

477
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,151
Things that I've read about but I have not

478
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Consolidated

479
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,479
And the reason really is for that is because

480
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
It basically a unicorn

481
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
Okay it's a concept that dreamed up by this

482
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Victorian Chapel

483
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Sir Robert giffen

484
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
Who claimed to have identified certain products

485
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
The people consume more of

486
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
As the price goes up

487
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,631
Violates the law of supply and demand

488
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:52,287
Absolutely does rising prices and Rising demand usually when prices go up demand.

489
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
Notable except

490
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
What's the distance

491
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,871
Okay let's just go over

492
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,711
The first is when the product is a luxury item like a limited editions

493
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,039
Score to the manufacturer wants to make the car and exclusive purchase

494
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
That signal status

495
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,879
So they crank up the price and maybe reduce the

496
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
Supply forcing scarcity on the market

497
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
I'm hopefully driving demands

498
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Secular cases the more you spend on

499
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
Collectible watch

500
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
Sports car in fact

501
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
The happy you are because you can Lord it over

502
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
We are friends

503
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Drop them out

504
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,287
Exactly so you see demand and price rising at

505
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
At the same time in those

506
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,639
Cases with this particular type of good

507
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:34,015
But those very specific could you see them all the time a giffen good

508
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
It's something very very

509
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,599
Beaufort you pretty much never see it

510
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,415
Because for a product to qualify as a giffen good

511
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
It has to be a staple

512
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,535
Or something of comparatively low value so not like a watch

513
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
Has to be something like

514
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,143
Bread flour all the time

515
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
When the price

516
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
Goes up

517
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
We consume more of

518
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
The house that work

519
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
Well it only works

520
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
If there's no substitute

521
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,895
So free sample Robert Griffin

522
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,943
Was studying poor people in Victorian times

523
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
Malaysian hundred

524
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
He came up with the example of bread

525
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,063
That's right he said that when the price of meat

526
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,135
Became too high for poor people they bought more bread

527
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,207
That increase in demand

528
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,767
Time for bread Drive the price of bread High record

529
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,815
Because there's no alternative to bread by

530
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
Noodles or rice and

531
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
In the in the way that we do

532
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
Do today

533
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
There was no alternative

534
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,263
I'm meat prices were still too high people have no choice

535
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
What to buy more bread even though the price kept Rising

536
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
And the more money the poor were paying

537
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,175
Breadman that there was even

538
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Less money

539
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
For me

540
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,063
So they had to buy even more bread and so on and so forth

541
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
It could go on forever and Siri

542
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
These days like in the present not in fear

543
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
I can't even think of something

544
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
For which there is no

545
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Substitute

546
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
Thinking

547
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
You Gatlin

548
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
You got something that we seen today

549
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:02,591
At least at least eight very rarely happens right that might have happened in the late 1800 today there was so many Alternatives that you can buy

550
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
Rice is very difficult to find a good example of

551
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
It's the worst

552
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,943
Summer search done in China

553
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,247
But suggested that in certain parts of that country

554
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,623
The price of rice and noodles went up and people still kept on buying them when meat so expensive

555
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
But for the most part

556
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
The concept

557
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,280
Demand for a staple product increasing at the same time as prices rising

558
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
It's pretty much a mirage

559
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,864
Rare bird that you know

560
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:31,520
