Text Jacob Goldstein Today Show is a rerun from mm

00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,960
I recently came across this article from 1980

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:15,616
It's an article about this new possibly dangerous thing that is about to transform the world

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,688
And if you read the title of this episode you already know it is

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,736
Is but let me just read you a little excerpt

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,760
In the article because

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
Because I love

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:23,808
Pier

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,600
When you quote boot

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,416
The program into your personal computer

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,024
You see little more than some letters running across the top of the display screen

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,072
And some numbers running down the side

13
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,888
The quote cursor

14
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,472
A tiny block of light on the screen that acts like a kind of

15
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,752
Electronic pencil

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
Can be moved

17
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,360
Parentheses by touch of the computer keyboard

18
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,896
Do any cell in order to

19
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
To quote input

20
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
Numbers or

21
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
It's funny when we were putting this together I thought it was going to be totally obvious what that's describing but like actually if you don't know already

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,720
What the shows about it's kind of confusing like you might not guess that in fact

23
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000
That article is about

24
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,280
The spreadsheet

25
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,096
The thing we think of today as Microsoft Excel

26
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,936
Miracle talk about how this weird thing is going to totally transform the

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
But it also have this warning

28
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,800
Quote the spreadsheet is a tool

29
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,336
And it is also a world

30
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,128
Reality by the numbers

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,432
The article spent a long time served Welling

32
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,712
What does it mean

33
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,016
When people start to think that numbers are reality

34
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
What will it do to the world

35
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,416
Hello and welcome to Planet Money on David kestenbaum

38
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
Today on the show

39
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
Reality by the number

40
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,936
What the spreadsheet has done

48
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,408
There was a time when a spreadsheet was an actual sheet

49
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,480
11 inch by 17 inch sheet of paper

50
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:34,368
I talked to a guy named Alan Schneider he was an accountant in the seventies and he said you spreadsheets all the time

51
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
Sometimes one sheet was not enough

52
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,000
So we would have to take the sheets together

53
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,048
So did you have like a really big death

54
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
Like how do you even manage something

55
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:50,496
Yeah I mean it it it took the greater part of a of a full-sized s

56
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,800
What is Frenchy does it gives you

57
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
Detailed way to look at

58
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,432
So if you're in the chocolate business you would put into a

59
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Spreadsheet

60
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
The cost of cocoa the cross

61
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Sugary

62
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
Your taxes

63
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Rent

64
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
Salaries all that stuff

65
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,928
Versailles

66
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
And then

67
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
You would do a whole lot of arithmetic and math and at the end of that you would have a pretty detailed picture of your business and how it was doing

68
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,936
If you run in the Chocolate Factory you get your accountant to do this

69
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,496
Are you go to a guy like Alan Schneider and say

70
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
Put together the spreadsheet

71
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,336
Allen and his whole team

72
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
Dates ripe

73
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,688
Once he built this thing it would have hundreds of different numbers run

74
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
And then

75
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
You never failed

76
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,856
After I only put this whole thing together the guy who ran the factory would come to Allen and say

77
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,184
What if I spend just a little more on coke

78
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
What will that mean for my business

79
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
That little question

80
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,536
It would mean a lot of work for

81
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
You take out that large eraser and start erasing each each of the excuse to take out of couch

82
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
You later then you have to re-add

83
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
And then

84
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Cross

85
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
Add each column

86
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,736
And then you'd have different tax results have a different accrual result you have it

87
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,552
Different cash results every column had to be changed

88
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,880
I'm headed to take a day like a really boring

89
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
Day to run all the numbers and that was just

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
When the client asked for one tiny little

91
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,095
It's the late seventies and not far from where Allen is working

92
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
There's a guy named

93
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
Dan Brickley

94
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
Sitting in class bored out of his

95
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
He the Guy Sebastian

96
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,847
The future inventor of the spreadsheet is at this moment in our story sitting in class

97
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
He's at Harvard Business School

98
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
In this big lecture hall

99
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
All end up at the front of the room there's a professor

100
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,783
Up on the Blackboard doing some spreadsheet type math

101
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Brooklyn has this date

102
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:46,975
I thought that you're always kind of silly that we're writing on this Blackboard what I can't have only we had a Blackboard what I could erase

103
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
Racing number and write a new number in

104
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
And everything would recalculate

105
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,375
This was a timely moment to have this daydream

106
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:59,775
The Apple II computer had come out it's a computer finally that you could have at home you can put on your desk

107
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,847
But of course at the time most people thought of it Paisley as a

108
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
Port Authority

109
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Like a video game

110
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,503
Brooklyn look the Apple II and thanks you know this could be my magic black boy

111
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
He thought I could do it

112
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,343
Accountants we're doing on paper with their giant spread

113
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Erasers

114
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,487
So he wrote a little program for the Apple 2 he needed some way right for the user

115
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
To move around the

116
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
Screen to enter in the number

117
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
Numbers and there was no mouse

118
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
But the computer had those video game control

119
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
Tell use those

120
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
The Apple II had paddles

121
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
For playing pong

122
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,311
Where you could turn it left and right it was a dial

123
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
And there's a button

124
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Push to fire you know

125
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
And the point you would turn

126
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
The dial back and forth

127
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
And the cursor would move from cell to cell

128
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,879
And then you push the fire button and then we go up and down as you turned it so you could actually

129
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,183
Kind of like a real Poor Man's Mouse

130
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
I love this early version

131
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
Spreadsheet with a video game

132
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:57,375
Yes I know trickling said in addition to pong you can also a little later play Space Invaders

133
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,447
But the downside is that actually from moving around a spreadsheet

134
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,031
How does a huge pain in the ass is going with the arrow key

135
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,103
But anyways his program the thing you built it actually worked

136
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,919
You could run this thing and it would actually calculate Go Bump Bump

137
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
You put a number in

138
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,015
And hit return and everything would recalculate

139
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
How you could watch it you can watch the number Shane bump bump bump it may sound

140
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
I had a real prototype

141
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,975
I love it I love it it makes sound the audio spreadsheet

142
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:28,863
Actually that was another problem in the early Miley said that took up a crazy amount of memory to make the sound to kill the sound

143
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
That's what happens next

144
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:34,495
Nixie hooks up with his old friends this guy named Bob Frankston also compute

145
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
A guy today noted the co-creator of this

146
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
That's it right as early partner

147
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
In frankston and bricklin they start

148
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:46,527
Giving demos around town basically showing this Prototype 2 guys like Alan Schneider to accountants

149
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
With big erasers

150
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
Outsiders on early demo

151
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
Did not get it

152
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,975
Do you remember the first time you saw an electronic spreadsheet

153
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
Yes

154
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
But I didn't understand what was going on in the demo like

155
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
The guy's hands are like moving really fast

156
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:10,847
The keyboard the cursor just moving around in the guy says it's be really great for your checkbook

157
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
I don't get it

158
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,687
The time it finally made sense to him

159
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,271
Is Winnie actually saw it being used in the real world and he was like oh

160
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,671
It's a spreadsheet the giant piece of paper but it's inside the computer that this happened for him not long after that

161
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,999
Super confusing demo it was at a local computer shop

162
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,815
The owner was testing out this program for dandruff

163
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,607
And he was using it for the story

164
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,423
Put in you know the basic stuff of his own businesses

165
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Payroll

166
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
Renton supplies his

167
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Sales

168
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Any show this to Allen

169
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
I needed the key thing

170
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
Is it down

171
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
I'm going to change

172
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
1 number

173
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,735
And suddenly boom everything recalculate automatic

174
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:54,623
Once he did that they're mean it was like an immediate reaction to me I mean I just

175
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Rush

176
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,743
I was flabbergasted this is amazing

177
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
This is amazing

178
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
And it was

179
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
L&M should get his hands on one of those early tests

180
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:11,263
And then not long after that when the spreadsheet software actually hit the market and sold under the name visit health

181
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
Allen became the first registered on

182
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
Ellen Snyder

183
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
Spreadsheet user number one

184
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:21,247
For anybody working with spreadsheets manly accountants I mean

185
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,855
This was like a godsend I mean you wouldn't have to

186
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,927
Do this grocery work over and over and over again

187
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,023
It was a godsend but it was also a threat because the computer could do in seconds

188
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
What used to take someone

189
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
An entire day today

190
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Tactical

191
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Computer was better

192
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
Computer didn't make

193
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,031
In that magazine article from 1984 that we talked about at the top of the show

194
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,359
There's this amazing little anecdote about an accountant

195
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
Right after the electronic spreadsheet

196
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
What happened was

197
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,735
This account he got a rush job

198
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
From what it is clean

199
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,343
Does the kind of thing that in the old paper Universe would it take in a couple days

200
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,927
This guy has this new electronic spreadsheets

201
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
He plugs in the numbers does the work in just a couple hours

202
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Then what he does

203
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
You just wait

204
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Let something sit on his desk for liked

205
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,631
FedEx is it back to the car

206
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
The client was like wow you did it so fast

207
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,007
It's a funny story that clearly like that was not going to be a long

208
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
If it only takes a couple hours to

209
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
To do a spreadsheet

210
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
And your billing by the hour

211
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
You're going to make less money

212
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,503
Right you're going to need fewer workers

213
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
Given need to get rid of

214
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
And in fact if you look at the numbers

215
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,183
Filipino national jobs data from the government you can see this

216
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:38,047
The number of accounting clerks and bookkeepers we're the kind of people actually do a lot of this math

217
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
Those numbers have fallen

218
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
Over the past several

219
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
Why do people got replaced by software

220
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,239
Dan bricklin says he thought about this when he was in betting the spread

221
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,055
That was an issue I had to come to terms with

222
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,359
Technology is a double-edged sword

223
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
I produced

224
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
General-purpose tools

225
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
They can be used

226
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
For all sorts of things

227
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
Summer good

228
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
And summer bad

229
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,855
Some will cause people to lose their job

230
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
Sun makes new jobs

231
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Possible

232
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
He was right

233
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
The spreadsheet both killed jobs

234
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
And it created

235
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,303
While the number of bookkeepers and accounting clerks spell

236
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,863
The electronic spreadsheet actually meant more jobs

237
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
For regular account

238
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
A few numbers

239
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,519
Since 1980 right around the time the electronic spreadsheet came out

240
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
400

241
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359
I wasn't bookkeeping and accounting clerk jobs

242
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Have gone away

243
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
But

244
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,479
600000 accounting jobs have been added

245
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,295
What happened is that accounting basically became cheap

246
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
And sometimes when something gets cheaper

247
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
People buy a lot more of that

248
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,951
Allen said clients bought more accounting

249
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
They called up and asked him to run more numbers

250
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
You can play the what if

251
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Game

252
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
You know

253
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
What if I did this instead of that

254
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,007
If you're that person who owned the Chocolate Factory you can now call Alan Schneider and ask

255
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
All kinds of questions what if we made our

256
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
Chocolate bars a little bit smaller

257
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Which made of

258
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Set larger

259
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
Can we give everyone a raise this

260
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,503
What if we started selling a lot of chocolate bars to

261
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
To China all these questions

262
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Normally it would have been very expensive

263
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
Brown decided to do it out of

264
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
On paper but now it was much cheaper

265
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
Some people ask a lot more

266
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
This account

267
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
Software Dan bricklin wrote

268
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
It becomes the killer app

269
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
For the Apple II

270
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
It's the $99 piece

271
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Software

272
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,471
That makes people go out and buy the $2,000 computer

273
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
And this actually went Way Beyond.

274
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
Italy

275
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
Doctors

276
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,359
Do better calculations

277
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
It's for anesthesiology before the

278
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
They're open heart surgery

279
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
I it was

280
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Used bikes

281
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
A company to decide where to put

282
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
Which slot machines

283
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
On the casino floor

284
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:43,231
My mother who is a principal to Middle School

285
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,303
She was using the spreadsheet to be able to

286
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,119
How to keep track of who's in what class and all

287
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,935
And it wasn't to a couple years later she said

288
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Do you know that

289
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
I can do calculations

290
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,799
I gave you the most

291
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
My mom

292
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,199
All right so there's all these examples of people sort of using spreadsheets to tweak what they do

293
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,503
But on top of that there is one in

294
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,039
Brooklyn didn't meant

295
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:12,159
Which branches were just a Monumental deal where spreadsheets became the center of the world

296
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,463
We'll have that and more in just a minute

297
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,815
Support for this podcast and the following message come from Slack

298
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,399
Used by companies all over the world to get everything done

299
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
Where every part of work from documents to decisions is stored archived and searchable in seconds

300
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823

Where work happens find out why it's slack.com

302
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,503
Spreadsheets transformed one industry more than any other

303
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
The industry is finance

304
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
Richard's basically gave birth to Modern wall

305
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
To this world we have today

306
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,951
Wall Street became obsessed with this

307
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
What if

308
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
What if we got a slightly better

309
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
What if he two companies merge

310
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
What if we structured the deal this way

311
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,679
Wall Street is a place where

312
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
You know you change what number you move

313
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
Pennies around in the

314
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Spreadsheet

315
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Change something at

316
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
Like a third decimal place

317
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,383
Suddenly at the bottom of the spreadsheet the last number

318
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
Like a million dollars

319
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,783
And so because of this the spreadsheet becomes the language of Wall Street

320
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
Today the spreadsheet is the way

321
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
People in finance talk to

322
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
It's the way they decide

323
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,535
Is this a billion dollar deal is this a 950 million dollar deal should we do this deal at all

324
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,351
Wall Street is basically a bunch of Excel spreadsheets

325
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Flying back in

326
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
Which explains the existence

327
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,983
Abyss

328
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:36,639
As the sound of nerds clapping give it up for model off 2014 basically like

329
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,479
The World Championships of building Financial models in Excel

330
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,783
It's an annual contest in people actually

331
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
Flying from around the world

332
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
To see who's best

333
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
Making financial model

334
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
The big prize comes with a little acceljoe

335
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
And so it's with great pleasure

336
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
I'm going to be presenting this trophy

337
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
With this golden keyboard

338
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
And this golden keyboard

339
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
Does not have an F1

340
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:05,055
David I'll be honest with you I did not get this joke had to Google it

341
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
Here it is the F1 key

342
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,639
It watches The Help menu

343
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
Christie's got done

344
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Excel humor

345
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
This year's winner

346
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
For first prize

347
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,087

World Championship

349
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
Diarmuid early

350
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,559
Did people make fun of you for women

351
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,655
Not actually as much as I expected they would

352
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
Please do the best out of it

353
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
You're the King of the Nerds

354
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,687
I said that as a nerd who is not the King of the Nerds to be clear

355
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
Literally on walls

356
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,039
At the Deutsche Bank office down by the New York Stock

357
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
I just sit in there a couple weeks

358
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,415
If you've ever wondered what it looks like inside a big

359
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Fancy office tower on Wall Street

360
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
You can just picture

361
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
Row after row

362
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Office after office

363
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
Of people staring

364
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,399
In this building right now

365
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
How many people do you think are using Sprite

366
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
At this exact moment

367
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,615
Probably thousands of people at this exact moment using spreadsheet

368
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
In this building

369
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
In this building

370
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,503
Hear the mouse is for the slow for the week

371
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,551
If you're a badass like your

372
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
You use the keyboard

373
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,135
I mean I probably know

374
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,207
Several hundred Excel keyboard shortcuts

375
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
He has his favorite is

376
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Alt

377
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
ESV

378
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
Press alt then you press

379
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
The evening

380
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Ask them the V

381
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
That is for paste Special Value

382
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Got ahold

383
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,239
8 years

384
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,519
Remove duplicates

385
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,591
No try that's text to columns old am is remove duplicates

386
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
There's even this story and okay

387
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
It's probably in apocrypha

388
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,735
Sorry but still it's a story about Ben 10

389
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,599
Going around and cutting the mouse chords of the rookie Stacy using the mouse in Excel

390
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,695
That spreadsheet article from 1984 basically predicted all of this

391
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
Here is one line

392
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,303
Quote a virtual Cult of the spreadsheet has form

393
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
Complete with gurus

394
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
And initiates detailed lore

395
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
Arcane rituals

396
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,495
And an unshakable belief that the way the world Works can be embodied in

397
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
Rose

398
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
And columns

399
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Numbers

400
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
The article where is in

401
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:20,991
What feels like this very early computer are away about that unshakable belief

402
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Physical

403
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,671
People tend to forget that even the most elegantly crafted spreadsheet is House of Cards ready to collapse

404
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,463
Set the first erroneous assumption

405
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,279
Turns out that was actually a fine worried

406
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,095
You may remember the London whale story from

407
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
4 years ago about a Trader at

408
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
P Morgan

409
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
Who lost the bank

410
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
6 billion dollars

411
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
That was partly spreadsheet error

412
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,591
I talked about the London whale with Matt Levine recent

413
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
Matt used to work at Goldman Sachs

414
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
Now he writes for Bloomberg

415
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Eva Mendes

416
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,735
Somebody working with the London whale

417
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,783
Build a spreadsheet to estimate

418
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
How risky the group

419
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Trades work

420
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
But there was a problem

421
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
There is one cell where

422
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,999
He had to divide by the average of 2 numbers and he divided by the

423
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
Some of us do not

424
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
Forgot to put in the two at the

425
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
Until that showed

426
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
Half as much risk

427
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
Has actually had

428
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
Everett

429
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
This is the thing about spreadsheet

430
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
They look really good

431
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
No matter what

432
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
Someone brings a spreadsheet

433
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,919
MTG it looks so precise it

434
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Numbers in

435
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
In Grafton

436
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Pretty fonts

437
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,039
Feels like it's telling you exactly how the work

438
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
It feels like

439
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Golf Course

440
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
It's just a model

441
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Pacific Gas

442
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
Chicken a problem with spreadsheets

443
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
Because they're very easy

444
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
How to use

445
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
So

446
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,863
It's really easy for like a 22 year old right out of

447
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,655
College to use Excel

448
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,703
I want to build something that really looks like

449
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Coca-Cola model

450
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,287
But living says you don't most people are

451
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,335
Smart enough to understand the difference

452
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:55,455
Between the model and reality because most of the time people get the math right so unbalanced

453
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,831
Frenchie's wouldn't actually a good tool that give us more information to help people make better decisions

454
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
It's a win it's a plus net plus

455
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
Spreadsheets have left us

456
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,231
In a different world though it's a world where we are cons

457
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Actually asking why

458
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
And by we I mean

459
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
Not just account

460
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
People on Wall Street length

461
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
All of us

462
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,911
Me more than I would like

463
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
Gone Way Beyond spreadsheet

464
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
It's like what if I flew Thursday instead of Friday

465
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
What if I took

466
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
78

467
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
Instead of Route 280

468
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Where's traffic

469
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
What if I stop

470
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,919
Exercising what if I eat more

471
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,807
Those last couple kinds of questions about like what am I eat differently what if I exercise more or less

472
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
You're matharu

473
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,879
Excel champ he can actually answer the

474
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
You because

475
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Of course

476
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
You built this bridge

477
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
Tracking all this personal information so he

478
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:46,143
With a spreadsheet on this data everyday and now he's got all these pretty grass

479
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
His weight and is exercise

480
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Totally normal

481
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
Totally normal right leg doesn't even seem weird anymore

482
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,991
The article that inspired the show

483
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,295
It was called a spreadsheet way of knowledge

484
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087

Kellogg have a spreadsheet right track my electricity meter

Bathing a difference it makes if I take a shower

I'm not single cuz like ouu suspension

So cheap it's painful

500

Knowledge is not always good

501
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
How much is a shower

502
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,103
Good morning winter

503
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,407
Bath and the kids last night was like a bucket
