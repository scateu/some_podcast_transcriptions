1
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,608
The other day I went to Madison Square Garden

2
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,376
Fornix

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,912
With reporter tea

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,960
Fruit there for a little research

5
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,240
Ice cold beer

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:11,520
Cold water

7
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,824
How much is a Bud Light

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,360
Bud Light $14

9
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,640
1 Bud Light

10
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,784
Long time listener is a planet money will know that I used to work at a stadium

11
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,832
All the time

12
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,112
People would complain about the prices

13
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,928
It's like 425 for Coke what is that Ramen it

14
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,952
And I'll be like

15
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
You don't like it

16
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,000
Don't buy it

17
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,048
But now I'm just

18
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,584
Amir consumer

19
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,864
And this sort of stuff

20
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,144
It kind of gets to me

21
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,192
Hey how are you

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,472
Could I have

23
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,008
Two hot dogs

24
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,544
Two pretzels

25
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,104
Two beers

26
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
A popcorn in the water

27
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,200
Just Bud Light

28
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:55,808
6275

29
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
Stadiums are like airports in movie theater

30
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,136
Their captive Market

31
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,416
Once you're inside

32
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,184
You don't have a choice

33
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,720
It's basically a monopoly

34
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,304
The reason this works out so well for the monopolist

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
Is you always

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,912
Think that you can somehow avoid getting hungry

37
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,496
But it's a waiting game and eventually you always do

38
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,544
Cancel demand for hot dogs and Bud

39
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,824
It doesn't change all that much

40
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,896
And I'm not once have been pushing the limits of that forever

41
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,944
Oh man

42
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,760
That's a pretty good dog though

43
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,576
It's like $0.75 per bite

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,696
How to say that's a good deal but if you do the math I'm not so sure

45
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,256
Yeah we're not so sure any of this makes sense

46
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
What if stadiums have actually been hurting themselves what if they haven't really understood their own Market

47
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,080
Turn on welcome to Planet Money I'm T group and I'm bouncing and teeth we are here today

48
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,176
Because you told me that someone is messing with this whole captive Market thing

49
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
Atlanta Falcons

50
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
The bringing prices down

51
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,320
You're selling hot dogs and beer for relatively normal price

52
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
Like $2 hot dogs

53
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
$5 beer

54
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,512
Today imma show what happens when a major sports team turn steam economics upside down

55
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,144

I talked to the girl master real quick

67
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,776
We get to Atlanta walk to the stadium and meet Xena smart

68
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
She's been tailgating

69
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
For 17 years

70
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
What are you cooking today

71
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,480
We are doing burritos and tacos and nachos think about

72
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
He'll get it for a second

73
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
For the price of

74
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
Parking some charcoal and some ice

75
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,416
You get to eat delicious hot food medium-rare even if you want it

76
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
Pet Supermarket prices

77
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,280
We obviously don't know if tailgating is

78
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
Is a direct response to the

79
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,376
Crazy Prices inside stadium

80
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
But sometimes

81
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
Goiter feels like it

82
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,288
Where in Atlanta to see how the Falcons experiment with food and beer pricing is working

83
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,848
Last season the Falcons dropped their price

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
My first question is

85
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
People to notice

86
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
We have seen it

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
Have you noticed that the foods cheaper

88
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
She's like oh yeah

89
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Much cheaper

90
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
But she still isn't buying more inside

91
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,208
That's old-time Tailgaters you know we got to tailgate so by time we're going to game really with full

92
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,768
So I drink

93
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:50,400
Do you know okay this next question is more of a personal Obsession of 5

94
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,984
Because the food is so expensive in

95
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
Side most stadiums

96
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
I always bring my own snacks

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
Some stadiums allow it

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
But many

99
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
Including the Falcons do not

100
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,992
The weather's a will there's a way and are Economist brains are like

101
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,808
Now that food prices inside the stadium of drop

102
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
Is that will lesser

103
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,904
Did people used to sneak in

104
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
More food

105
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
I don't know about the food

106
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
Like

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
Smelled alcohol

108
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,423
How do people sneak alcohol into they just put a little bottle under there

109
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
Oakley

110
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,079
We say goodbye to Tina Joe falcon

111
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,663
I'm walking to the stadium or first stop

112
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,943
Is the front office

113
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
There we find

114
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Rich McKay

115
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
The head of the falcon

116
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,343
Rich is American football

117
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Royalty

118
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Music ID

119
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
He was the ball boy

120
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,463
For the Tampa Bay Buccaneers his dad was

121
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
He grew up

122
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
Became the general manager of the Bucks

123
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
Hi Tony Dungy

124
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,423
He seems like a walking there is no I in team poster

125
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
He only speaks in we state

126
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
Camera we just talk

127
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,687
Just the radio take off your shoes if you want

128
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,063
Rich started off on the football side of things but eventually he moved to the business side

129
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
And he started looking at the NFL ban survey

130
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,207
You know it's two things that the Falcons were completely failing at

131
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
The food

132
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
In the park

133
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Parking

134
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
There wasn't much I could do about that

135
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
In the food

136
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,143
Could you complain about

137
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,959
I don't know warmbier yes you can

138
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
That's all you do is complain you don't it's not going to happen

139
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
As a result of it the way Stadium food usually works

140
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Is people like rich

141
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,991
Pretty much Outsource all of the food stuff to a huge company called the concessionaire

142
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,295
They don't have to worry about the food at all

143
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
But also they can't do any

144
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,439
Switch new the food situation was bad but didn't know how bad

145
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
Until this one day

146
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
We had a ticket guy

147
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,095
Came to me and he said to hey I want you to go to a meeting

148
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
Are we going to meet with the concessionaire

149
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
And we're going to talk about

150
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
The setup

151
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
4 sweet

152
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
Sweet light sky Box where the fancy beef

153
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
Concessionaires run those

154
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
But I said we can talk about

155
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
And he said that the pricing

156
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
I said okay what's the weather

157
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Concern

158
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
Well my concern is is it and now they've got

159
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
They charge this this this in

160
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
Do you know that for the little

161
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
Stir straws

162
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
They charge

163
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:29,375
36 bucks for a box of 20

164
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:36,031
So rich and the ticket guy they grabbed a box of straws and bring them to a meeting with the concessionaire

165
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,823
We said yeah we get my package and

166
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:43,711
And they don't really look at it and we are they just pay us for the setup and we took a look at the straws

167
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
Aren't I mean isn't this a problem

168
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
For Rich a line has been crossed

169
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
You might say

170
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
It was the final straw

171
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
That's when we asked about the contract

172
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,743
That's what we asked about how these prices set

173
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,047
And by we this time he means

174
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
Greg B

175
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,119
Greg is the chief operating off

176
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Officer the falcon

177
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
A little more reserved

178
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,191
Numbers guy

179
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
And also

180
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Cheap

181
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
Like when you take his wife and kids to the game

182
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
I get a hot dog cut in half

183
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,687
Give each of them a half of a hot dog and buy two waters and for straws

184
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
This is too expensive you guys got to got to share your water

185
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,575
Craigslist of the contract brings refined storage

186
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
And according to Rich

187
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
It's not good

188
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
They

189
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
We're in charge of pricing

190
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
The concessionaire was

191
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,023
And they were allowed to charge quote market prices

192
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
So we should

193
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Let me know

194
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,863
$6 hot dog is not a market price

195
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
I need to know

196
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
Market is Define

197
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,215
By similarly situated

198
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Sports

199
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Venues

200
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
And we were like

201
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
That's a

202
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
Terrible definition of market

203
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
You notice a good definition of though

204
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
A captive Market

205
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
A place where one seller has a monopoly

206
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
And no one cannot do

207
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
The Falcons needed was a new contract

208
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
I'm heading opening

209
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
Are designing a brand new stadium

210
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
And with it comes a new concessions Conte

211
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
So they told other big concessionaires

212
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
Come to our offices in

213
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
And they all came

214
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,375
With the same sort of contract that everyone use

215
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
1

216
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
The concessionaire right there

217
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
Huge upfront check to the stadium

218
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
And then

219
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
They both split the revenues from the

220
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,871
Someone came in and pitched us will write you a check today for

221
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
420 million dollars

222
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,479
So you can buy all the equipment that you need to buy

223
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,087
Will give you 60% of the gross revenue so before an expense

224
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Kaiser pay

225
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
And you're just done

226
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
And then we worry about all the rest

227
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:35,327
The best of you could possibly get right that that be the best deal you can get and and that's very enticing just we could be done with it we don't have

228
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Don't worry about it anymore

229
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
I used to work

230
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
At a stadium

231
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
In concessions

232
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
And this right here

233
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
With a revelation

234
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,055
I did not know this is how these deals were structured

235
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
But now I understand

236
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Why prices are

237
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
You're so high right from the start

238
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,735
The concessionaire has dug itself a multimillion-dollar hole

239
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,039
So for them to get their money back

240
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,575
There's only you know

241
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
Two sides of the balloon left to squeeze

242
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,975
And it's food quality let's buy the cheapest food that we can

243
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,791
It was charged as much as we can

244
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
And maybe I you know a third is

245
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Is labor

246
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,983
Let's have as few people as possible to make all of this happen which all of that translates into

247
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:19,615
Bad Fan Experience that's why it takes so long to get a hot dog that's why the hot dog cost so much

248
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
And that's why I might be cold that's right

249
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
Exactly right

250
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
In other words

251
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
The fan loses

252
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,575
Elephants keep losing well at a certain point

253
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Sitting on my couch

254
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,927
Watching my new HDTV with my frozen pizza

255
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:38,047
Start looking pretty awesome can't be watching the TV and the other Stadium at the same time

256
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,863
So the Falcons decided to take charge of concession

257
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
Can sand get rid of the whole revenue-share thing

258
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Instead

259
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
Taipei concessionaria management fee

260
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
Potato

261
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Control

262
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
How many cooks there are

263
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
The quality of the food

264
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
And importantly

265
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
The prices

266
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
The team didn't want to just lower prices

267
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
They wanted to make a state

268
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,271
We we we call it street price

269
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
Like $2 popcorn

270
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,391
$3 fries $2 sodas with unlimited free refills

271
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
Who plays the people be happier

272
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,999
Sure but also there's some economics 101

273
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
Lower the price

274
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,887
Increase the quantity demanded and hopefully recoup some of the cost

275
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,935
We were trying to figure out

276
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
Greg was through models

277
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,775
Okay if we were deuce

278
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
Pricing

279
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,847
What demand is at going to drive

280
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,663
Great estimated that most people will be buying

281
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
25% more than

282
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,271
But because they drop prices so much

283
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,087
It looked like they were still going to leave money on the table

284
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Compared to the old motto

285
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,671
Even though they were selling more nachos and Hanukkah

286
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,511
But they were really invested in this idea so they decided

287
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Let's go ask.

288
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
The owner of the Falcons Arthur

289
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,655
He been on them for years about improving The Fan Experience

290
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
So they drove the blanks office

291
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Went to a conference room

292
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
Inside around a tape

293
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,543
Who is shaped like a football

294
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,639
We were a little nervous whenever you're going to go to your boss and make a pitch that

295
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
Involves

296
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
Enough

297
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Lost Revenue potential

298
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
Are you you're a little nervous

299
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
You walked into

300
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,903
Arthur's office and told them he was going to lose how much money

301
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
4 million dollars

302
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
The Blake went for it

303
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
He really wanted those Fan Experience

304
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,071
Yet turned out convincing their paws

305
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
The hard part

306
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
Was finding a new partner

307
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
A new concessionaire

308
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,055
They picked it up you them hey we've got this new model for concessions

309
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
And we're going to be reducing price

310
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
Like a lot like

311
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
50%

312
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
And

313
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,991
Could day and what they see themselves being a partner in that

314
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
And that was a little

315
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
That chicken

316
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Remember

317
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
The Falcons are the client

318
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
But most of these concessionaires

319
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,231
I just couldn't even comprehend with the falcon

320
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Proposing

321
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
They were messing

322
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,839
With one of the oldest money making relationships

323
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
In the business

324
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
The team ended up working at a deal with a concession are they new

325
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
They done the food at the Royals Stadium

326
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,519
And so the Falcons made in an ounce

327
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,823
We're bringing prices down

328
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,223
Do you know who doesn't like to hear hey you were trying a radical experiment that might unanchor your customers perception

329
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,039
How much they should be paying for your overpriced product

330
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
The billionaires who owned the rest of the NFL

331
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,975
The first NFL owners meeting that we went to after we announced it

332
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
There were other teams that were

333
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Mad

334
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
I mean really upset

335
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,191
What are you doing to us why are you guys doing this

336
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:30,079
Yeah this is a big Revenue stream for us don't forget

337
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
And that was assuming p

338
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
People bought 25% more product

339
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
Because of cheaper price

340
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
The really

341
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
They didn't know it would happen

342
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
Nobody had really done this before

343
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,367
Okay enough Monday morning quarterbacking

344
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,671
I want to see this in action it's game time

345
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,023
Atlanta is playing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers

346
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
And so far it's been a rough season for the falcon

347
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
I need a win

348
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
We get inside and take a look at

349
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
But I want to be roaming The Conch

350
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,239
Because I want to know

351
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Are people buying

352
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
We should say

353
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
What the Falcons are doing

354
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Is not

355
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
2 radical 4

356
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
All the time business

357
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Is a shifter price

358
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
To increase profit

359
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
You got your supply curve or demand curve

360
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,855
Invite where they meet me that is the optimal price

361
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
And our question is

362
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,439
National anthem sorry

363
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,615
How much money do

364
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
You have in your wallet

365
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,711
Let's see I'm taking it out here and I have

366
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,319
You have done not tell you what

00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,111
I don't lend you twenty bucks

368
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
All right

369
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,439
We've got twenty bucks let's go spend it

370
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,511
Let's go Nick we head into the con

371
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
I got to say

372
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
It's not half time yet is it

373
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,423
Nope we're still got a ways to go

374
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,823
There's a lot of people waiting in line for super like what on the way

375
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
The thing is

376
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
More lines don't necessarily mean more profit

377
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,247
You drop the price and your margins at dinner

378
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Okay

379
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,391
You got to hot dog to fry one park on one bottle of water into Bud Light

380
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
That's right

384
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
No way

385
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,423
That's pretty much the same thing we bought at Madison Square Garden

386
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
At half staff

387
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:40,127
All right end of the first half we got a lot more food to eat

388
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:46,527
I got a lot more money to spend after the break will come back and eat the rest

All the way from New Jersey

407
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
He's a big falcon

408
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,007
He goes and sees them when they play in Philly

409
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
My brother's an Eagles fan they suck

410
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,431
I go to the games with him and I thought he played in Philly it was ridiculous I have been like almost

411
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
$40

412
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247

00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527

A burger

415
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:57,951
And like popcorn it was ridiculous today you have Whataburger fries and a soda baking soda the second time I actually

416
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,279
But food like I've never bought more than one time at a stadium

417
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Straight

418
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
That right there is the sound

419
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655

Breckenridge

421
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,495
Project has been a wild success

422
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
For 1

423
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
People are coming in way earlier

424
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
In spending more money

425
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
Because of it

426
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,943
They said they're selling as much before the game even starts at the new stadium

427
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
As it get the entire game at the old

428
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
Stadium Creek and Rich. That they were going to leave

429
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
4 million dollars

430
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
But it's actually

431
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
And that's because

432
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Remember

433
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,231
They thought they were going to increase sales 25% at best

434
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,791
Big blown past that they are selling

435
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,839
53% more product

436
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,631
Another teams have noticed

437
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Big teams

438
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,031
Like the Ravens the Lions Mississippi State they are all significantly lowering their price

439
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
The Falcon say they have few regrets

440
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Except

441
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
Maybe the free refills on

442
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
As evidence by David from Jersey

443
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
The guy who thinks the Eagles suck

444
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
How many refills did you do today

445
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
Is the second one

446
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:02,975
Nice second one the second one and there's still a lot of gameplay to go people are refilling their sodas on

447
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
Average 3.7 *

448
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
And Greg says at that rate

449
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
He be happy if they're breaking even on soda

450
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,591
I'm headed to the bleachers and sit next to a guy

451
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,895
Really responding to low beer prices

452
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687

453
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
950 song

454
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
A game

455
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
Birthday weekend happy birthday

00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Thank you.

457
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,415
Is Michelob for you

458
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
Looking out

459
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
At this huge Stadium

460
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:41,887
All I could think about was yasher good story generous donor does right by the consumer everyone's happy blah blah blah

461
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,935
But there is more to

462
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,751
Building the new stadium was really expensive

463
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
And you know what

464
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
The Falcons raise their ticket price

465
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,639
The Falcons don't even sell single game 2

466
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
Other than for standing room

467
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,503
If you want to see you have to buy season 2

468
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
It seems like the Falcons

469
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
Aren't really

470
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,671

Sora fan anymore

472
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,023
Their marketing towards the people who will come back

473
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
Time After Time

474
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:17,727
