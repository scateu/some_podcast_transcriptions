Metal value of this coin

Hundred dollars today

28
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,792
This gets us to our listeners

29
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
Trinity comes from

30
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,168
Today Show we are answering questions from listeners

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,448
So what did Chris

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,496
Exactly wants to know

33
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,032
Is there a way

34
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,312
To take advantage of the

35
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,152
Did the US government is minting these weird coins coins

36
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,200
With different face values

37
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
Frontier Market

38
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,736
Okay

39
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
That's good question Chris

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,576
Is not the first person to notice this up

41
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,160
All right about 25 years ago there was a businessman in Las

42
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,440
Vegas a few businesses

43
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,464
Plumbing

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,744
Air conditioning

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
Painting

46
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
And he came up with a way to

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,096
To use these coins to get out of

48
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
Of paying

49
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
Payroll tax

50
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,448
What do you do what say that I was like a painter

51
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
I would go up

52
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
To the payroll window

53
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
At the end of my Wii

54
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
And I would say

55
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,896
Hello I'm here for my

56
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,968
Wages

57
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,064
And the person in the window they would hand me a bunch of silver and gold coins

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
That had

59
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,624
Face values that were like

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,392
50 bucks

61
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
$50

62
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
And that's the transaction it is

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
Is on the books I got paid

64
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
$50

65
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
But

66
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Then

67
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
I could take my coin

68
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,448
To literally a window next door

69
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,544
Like physically and I got to go back to a person

70
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
Who would give me actual cash

71
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
Add an exchange rate of about life

72
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
8 times so I would get

73
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
$400

74
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,272
But that $400 that wasn't going to affect

75
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
Payroll taxes because

76
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
That Exchange

77
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,416
That didn't take place at the office is payroll window

78
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,256
It happened at the very convenient office go exchange

79
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Window

80
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
Right exact

81
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,608
Okay so what we have here is

82
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Entrepreneurial tax

83
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,960
The Beijing basically

84
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,544
Ocasek is he only has to record that he paid

85
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
The face value Lexington

86
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
Fifty bucks yes

87
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,200
But then the employees are going to get $400 cuz they're cashing it on the

88
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,040
Value of the metal and everybody wins that feels kind of creative

89
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,600
Little mom-and-pop operation

90
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
Over about 5

91
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
This businessman paid

92
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,976
More than 25 million dollars

93
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:11,744
In wages

94
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Million that is

95
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,096
Crazy and she was not only using this for his business

96
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
This scheme was so inventive

97
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,448
Also became a payroll contract

98
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,544
And it helped other business is almost a hundred million dollars in wages

99
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
Through this coin scam

100
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,640
Okay so he's like franchising tax

101
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
Yes wow

102
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
Unfortunately when the IRS found out about this

103
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
They did not think

104
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,064
Clever and so excited

105
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Key West

106
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Charged with tax

107
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,184
Evasion and then sentenced to almost 16 years in prison

108
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,024
And ordered to pay the US government back about 16 million

109
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,376
Did he try paying with silver coins

110
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,936
But to answer Chris's question

111
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,800
Can you take advantage of the face value market value difference of American Eagle coins

112
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
Probably not no no no

113
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,664
Devon and okra stew not do

114
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,248
Do I get to keep the coin I don't know I should find out if I can expense

115
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:12,928

139
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
So Jacob

140
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez she

141
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,007
She is the newly elected congresswoman we've been hearing Lots about

142
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,823
She is proposed raising at marginal income tax

143
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
Tax rates

144
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:39,711
And there are lots of questions about what those are and so we are here to ask you

145
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
Can you explain marginal tax

146
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
I'm thrilled

147
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,599
I'm very excited about this

148
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
There's this

149
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,671
Very basic idea

150
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,207
About income taxes

151
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
In America that is

152
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
Non controversial

153
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
And that is

154
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,095
Income taxes should be Progressive

155
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Right

156
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,983
And that means rich people should pay a higher percentage of their income

157
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Temperature

158
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,615
Right okay so not just hire because they're earning more but a higher percentage of their wealth yes

159
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
Pretty much everybody agrees

160
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
That's okay

161
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,479
But that creep is interesting kind of math

162
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
Right because

163
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
Say we decide

164
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
People who are earning

165
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,135
Whatever less than $10,000 a year

166
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,183
Shouldn't have to pay any income tax

167
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
And we decide

168
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
You know $10,000

169
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,327
$20,000 if you're in that band

170
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,399
You should pay whatever 10% of your income

171
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
But if we do it that way there's a problem

172
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,543
Because in the system we've just created

173
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
People who are making

174
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
9999 dollars

175
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
P0

176
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
People who are making

177
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
$10,000.00

178
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
Now have to pay 10% of that

179
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
So people are going to gain this

180
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,463
System to try to earn 9999

181
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,023
It's right that your taxes if your making 10000

182
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,607
You're actually making 9000 and you're worse off than the person who is less than

183
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,679
That is a disaster of a policy

184
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
So

185
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
We come up with the marginal income

186
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
Okay and what that says is

187
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,383
Each sort of chunk of your income gets taxed at a different

188
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
Right so

189
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,223
The first 9999 dollars

190
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Upay

191
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
0

192
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
And then

193
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,367
The next chunk say 10000 to $20,000

194
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
Upay

195
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
10%

196
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
Okay so if you're making

197
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
10000

198
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
And $1

199
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
All you would owe is $0.20

200
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Syntax

201
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,679
I do know we can't keep doing this up and up and up right we can add another

202
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
Higher marginal tax

203
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:42,335
We can say we're going to tax income over $20,000 a year at tape twenty percent

204
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,151
And in the real world we have seven of these

205
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Early steps

206
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Savjz chunks

207
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
Call bracket

208
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
All the way up to a top

209
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
Rack it up

210
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
Marginal income tax rate

211
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
That starts

212
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:57,695
At over $500,000 a year if your single over $600,000 a year if

213
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
If you're married

214
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,791
And every dollar over that amount in that pop

215
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
Bracket

216
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
Is attack stat

217
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
37

218
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
Okay so the

219
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
Currently the highest

220
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
Marginal income tax rate

221
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
Is 37%

222
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
And what

223
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
Congresswoman Ocasio Cortez

224
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,663
Proposing is basically one more step above that which would be

225
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,711
At 10 million and above

226
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
People would be taxed

227
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
70

228
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
So in that universe

229
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,159
It would still presumably be 37% for every dollar you make between $500,000

230
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
+ 10 million

231
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231
Okay then every dollar over 10 million

232
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
Is taxed at 70

233
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,583
Okay which the vast majority of us will never

234
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
Sadly have to worry about and speak for yourself

235
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,447
Jacob has Big Dreams for his book

236
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
Alright thanks so much Jacob

237
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,527
We have Brian Dorsett in the studio he edits the show but today

238
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
We have them on Mike

239
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Answering questions

240
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
So can we got a question from Alyssa

241
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,207
I want to know what's up with the brexit

242
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
Fairy

243
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
Am I sorry I mean the kind you find on the ocean

244
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
And

245
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
I'm going to play you

246
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
Some sounds

247
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
To get us in the mood

248
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
For a serious show

249
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
About the future of England's GDP

250
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
All right

251
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,591
Wait okay I'm going to

252
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,943
I'm going to fall asleep before that happens quickly turned economics

253
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
So that is the sound of the ocean

254
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,807
And obviously and it's in the port of Dover in English

255
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,367
Where I found NPR's London correspond

256
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
Frank length

257
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
Did I hear a seagull

258
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:40,095
Yes we have brought them in for this

259
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:46,495
Nice atmosphere and can you see France like Hills or Cliffs of Dover and Calais

260
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,359
So yeah it's pretty close so Dover is England's connection to Francis where the channel is

261
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,175
The tunnel for the track that runs under the English Channel and it says

262
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,967
Huge Port Frank told me

263
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
10000 trucks

264
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
Add a cross the channel here

265
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,831
Yeah I mean right now I'm looking at

266
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
An entry ramp onto the porch

267
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
And you can just see

268
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Trucks

269
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,047
Rolling down it right on the fairies and there's no custom Shack or anything like that it's seamless

270
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,375
Just like taking the ferry safe from Delaware

271
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
Up to Southern New Jersey

272
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
It's the same kind of thing except

273
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
You're actually traveling from one country to another

274
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,335
But all the seamlessness might just end soon right because

275
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,151
Parliament is just about to vote on whether or not to accept

276
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
Prime minister Theresa May's exit.

277
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,479
Exactly her

278
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
Brexit deal

279
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,807
Because in order to leave the EU there are

280
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:38,207
Two ways to go in 1 oz of everything organized and agreed on with all the other countries in Europe and the other is to just

281
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Say

282
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,791
Goodbye

283
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
If Parliament turns down

284
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
May's brexit deal

285
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,471
It makes it just a little more likely that England could leave without any kind of

286
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,543
Which would completely change this scene in Dover

287
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,615
Totally you would have custom checks for the first time in

288
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
Probably decades

289
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:02,271
And even their estimates that even if it takes 60 or 70 seconds to clear a truck

290
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,367
I'll get that could create miles and miles of truck back up

291
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,231
And really slow down trade university did the math and figured out that there would be six

292
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,023
Dake using other words

293
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,583
Traffic that would take 6 days to clear

294
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,863
Just permanent gridlock

295
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
EXO

296
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
England has thought maybe we should start working on getting some other ports moving and they started talking to other Ferry companies

297
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
And other parts like Ramsgate

298
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
Which is just North of Dover

299
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,943
The government gave a contract to a company called seaborne

300
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,551
This got a lot of attention because the seaborne company doesn't actually own any fairy

301
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
Which would seem to be a good thing to have

302
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
If you

303
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:43,743
We're fairy company so yeah that she's not going to work right away they were moving fast there will be fat

304
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
But

305
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:49,119
Europe is connected now and they're all kinds of industries that completely depend on things getting there

306
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,983
Really quickly so the people who do this stuff the people deliver things are making all kinds of backup plans

307
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,799
Frank talk to one guy who owns 250 trucks

308
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
And here

309
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,127
He spent over a billion box

310
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,991
Dim fire helicopter going to help things go really badly

311
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
He can load small item

312
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
Like lighters things like that

313
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:12,415
And be able to fly them across the channel into Europe and land and

314
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:18,815
Take them directly to the factory to keep the factory lines going this very problem is just one of a long list of

315
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Things that brexit

316
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Is growing up

317
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
So there

318
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
This country is kind of stuck

319
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,215
Doing a thing it's pretty sure isn't going to work out that well

320
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,543
I think that's true hard to find illegitimate economist

321
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,359
Who doesn't think that this makes the United Kingdom both

322
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Poor

323
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,479
And have a lot less leverage because it's not a part of this giant single Market in Europe

324
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Tell Karen

325
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,831
Bad news in England okay but I do have some more calming waves

326
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
If you want to go out on Kik

327
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
All right to answer the next question

328
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,495
Take you back to an episode we did in 2017 it was about the gross domestic product forecast coming out of

329
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
The White House the GDP forecast

330
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
They were projecting 3% growth

331
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Over the neck

332
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
10 years

333
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Which to be clear is

334
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
Much higher than what anybody else

335
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
And then Trump as he

336
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
What about it

337
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
The forecast even

338
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Further

339
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:18,207
Here's a clip from our original episode

340
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
At some point

341
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
Into the future

342
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
5 and above

343
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
I just

344
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,679
Extremely hot out of respect the office

345
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
Okay so

346
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Clearly

347
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Along with most

348
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Economist we were

349
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Article of

350
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
That projection

351
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,687
But at the end of last year GDP did hit 3% for that year

352
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
So a lot of listeners have written to us

353
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,063
With questions like this one from David Gross

354
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Play Planet Money

355
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
Just curious if you had revisit the episode

356
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Here We Grow Again

357
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,487
Explored how unlikely it was Teresa

358
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
The 3%

359
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,303
GDP growth in President Trump's budget

360
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,887
Pirate Looks like the target may have been achieved in 2018

361
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,727
That is a fair question so I brought Darien Woods into answer this Darien is

362
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
Hey Darrian in the original episode we spoke with a guy named Marco behind he's an economist for the

363
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
The committee for response

364
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Federal budget

365
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
And earlier this week

366
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
We called him back up

367
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Is the difference between

368
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,575
Long-term sustained growth

369
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
And near-term Pro

370
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
He says yeah we

371
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
Did hit that 3% last year but

372
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
Let's just for one year

373
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
The forecast for

374
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
Tant

375
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:31,167
So I asked him is this category likely to continue there's only one single forecaster at estimating even close to 3%

376
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
That's the White House bicycle

377
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,055
Two reasons why the stars probably won't lie

378
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,407
The first reason for the 3% growth was that last little bit of the recovery have

379
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
From the 2008/2009

380
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
Conversation he says that probably won't continue

381
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
The second reason

382
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
Little crisis created equal

383
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
And the current 3% growth

384
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
A large share of it

385
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,439
Is the one-time effect of

386
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,511
A huge hundred fifty billion dollars a year spending bill

387
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,327
And even larger 200 billion dollar year

388
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,655
Text boxes this 3% growth rates

389
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,727
Fundamentally change the economy in a way that will last

390
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
Sustained

391
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
It's primarily to huge spending bill

392
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,407
Epic tax-cut someone time events with fix it won't lock

393
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
Back is a term for a sugar high

394
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,295
When I drink my morning coffee or eat a lot of sugar

395
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,367
That's going to cause the economy to go into hyperdrive for a period of time

396
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,463
But it's likely to be followed by a crash unless we do something

397
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,255
Caboose that productive capacity

398
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,071
In fact Mike says if we stay on this path

399
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
We're in trouble we're in big trouble fiscally

400
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
And there's not an easy way out

401
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
So you're really worried

402
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
I'm extremely worried

403
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
Okay so David are listener

404
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Are you are right

405
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
United States

406
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
Did hit 3% growth

407
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
Last year

408
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,455
But it sounds like it's probably temper

409
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Yep that's right

410
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:54,623
Lomax says if he's wrong about this I will gladly email that that listener

411
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
And tell them that

412
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
It looks like I was

413
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
I was wrong

414
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,791
Thanks Darian for the good news bad news but you Karen

415
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Shane McCann

416
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,335
Karen Duffin you are intern and this is your last day at Planet

417
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,383
It is I'm sad to go

418
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
I know we're bummed about this

419
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
But there is one thing we want you to do before you

420
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,879
That is answer a listener question that I believe you are the most qualified person to answer

421
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,487
Yes as senior Generation Z correspondent I am here and ready

422
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,791
Your question alright that's older people that

423
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
Thank you

424
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,399
Okay so the question comes from a listener in Florida named Raphael

425
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
How do money transfer apps

426
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,239
Cash out venmo and square

427
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,567
Generate Revenue if they don't charge for their services

428
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,847
Okay so

429
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
Raphael is asked

430
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Talking about apps

431
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,943
Like venmo is probably the most

432
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,527
Popular one right now so maybe let's start with what is

433
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
Venmo

434
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
Venmo is just an

435
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,879
An app that lets you send money to your friend

436
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,207
And unlike something like PayPal venmo has like

437
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,839
Speed where you can describe the payments you're making and then all your friends can see them and so it starts to look like

438
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Okay so that's been

439
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
How do they earn money

440
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,007
So I did some research I talk to someone at venmo

441
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
And basically

442
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,079
The first way involves taking

443
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
Taking all of the money that

444
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
I have on venmo.

445
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
That you have on venmo that anyone who

446
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
Who puts their money on venmo

447
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
Taking all that money

448
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
Putting it in a pile and then

449
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
Collecting the interest on it at

450
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
And investing it okay that's one way

451
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,719
Another way is there are the small fees UK

452
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Can pay for certain

453
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,351
One is if you want to transfer money to your bank more quickly

454
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
They charge a fee

455
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
Okay another is if you want

456
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Is a credit card on

457
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,031
Okay that makes sense a lot of companies like them

458
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
Do that

459
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:54,175
Kind of thing to earn money but I noticed also so I have Uber and now when I go to take an Uber I can

460
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
Hey with Ben

461
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
Are they earning money off of that

462
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,295
They are what venmo has started to do

463
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
As they approached retailers

464
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Jason said

465
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
Look up Uber

466
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,903
Look GrubHub

467
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,463
If you let people pay with venmo

468
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,767
You will have access to

469
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
All these young

470
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
People with disposable income

471
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,191
And if you let us process those payments will just charge a small fee

472
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
Okay so

473
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,775
Venmo gets money and these

474
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
Retailers get young hip

475
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
People like you

476
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,175
Exactly

477
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,247
It's our parting gift thanks Shane

478
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:34,367
Thank you Karen

479
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Karen

480
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Alex

481
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
I have listened to question

482
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:42,303
Before you do that's great because we're doing a listener question show come prepared

483
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
My question comes from Anthony Ellison

484
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,423
It has to do with the Federal Reserve and interest rates

485
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,751
The Federal Reserve is the Central Bank of the United States and the

486
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,799
The target interest rate ranges that it sets

487
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,615
It's like the throttle for the American economy

488
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
The economy a bit

489
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
Then you raise interest rates will

490
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,991
You want to boost the economy

491
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Make it cheaper to borrow money

492
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
Contigo Spanish

493
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
But when they do this

494
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
And they change the target range range

495
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,695
They always do it in increments of

496
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
.25

497
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Percent

498
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
So

499
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
Anthony Elizondo his

500
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Question was

501
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,143
Why did they always do it in increments of .25

502
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:23,263
Percent I mean even when the Federal Reserve has made huge moves like during the financial crisis

503
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
They did it

504
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
With five

505
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
Or a clean one for

506
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Always

507
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
Increments of .25

508
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:33,503
Right because we live in this super-precise world so why are we still moving this

509
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
Really important number in is chunky

510
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
.25 increments

511
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
Nobody in the office New

512
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,463
So I called up Donald Cohen who is now

513
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
Senior fellow at

514
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Institution

515
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,863
Before that I worked at the Federal Reserve for 40 years

516
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
But he says

517
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,239
There wasn't any specific moment or decision that made

518
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,287
.25%

519
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:02,943
I think I'm a new challenge my memory when your email yesterday

520
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,759
But I believe when I started in the 1970

521
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,319
The federal funds rate was quoted

522
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Yeah

523
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
Ace and quarters

524
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
And have then

525
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
5/8

526
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,767
Etc it's just easier to talk that way as

527
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
People write you work at a bank you called another bank and you say hey I want to borrow some money from you at two and a quarter percent

528
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
Two and a half

529
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:28,543
Right like I'm not going to ask you for 4:30 of a donut I'm going to ask you for

530
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,591
A half a donut or if I'm being good

531
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359
Corte rapido

532
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,919
Stella Corner point was is obvious

533
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
A286 a nice

534
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
This round number

535
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,783
I think it's also

536
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
Large enough

537
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
To Mater

538
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,183
So it's a non-trivial change in interest rates

539
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
But it's not huge

540
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,767
.25% is like a Goldilocks

541
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,375
But he also says what's important is not the exact range

542
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
Did the Federal Reserve set

543
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,727
It's whether the range is going to go up or going to go down

544
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
The direction

545
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
That is the signal that matters

546
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Economy

547
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,359
But right here this is where

548
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
I'm with our listener

549
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
If this target rate is soham

550
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
Important

551
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
Shouldn't

552
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
The Federal Reserve be more precise and not

553
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
Less

554
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,087
So I push down

555
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,952
Did anybody in any of those meetings ever say hey guys let's just try .62

556
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
I know

557
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,144
No not that I can not that I can remember always happen if somebody said that I think someone would have said but that's not the

558
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
The way the market works

559
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:32,544
And why would we go ahead and do that so I think you need a reason to deviate

560
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,360
From what you've been doing all along

561
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,688
And holding steady looking measured and consistent

562
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Is very important

563
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760

578
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
One last quick question

579
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
Hi

580
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Hi

581
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,000
Do you want to introduce yourself

582
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,352
I am your identical twin sister Marita

583
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,704
I got a question that I think you might be the most qualified

584
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Answer

585
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,752
Okay go on

586
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,568
We get lots of this kind of mail for men and women

587
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:13,152
Writing in to let us know that they do not like the voices of

588
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
Specifically the women on the show

589
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
Valley girls

590
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
People sing Christian

591
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
How to throw d

592
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,184
I recently got one from a listener who I'm going to call Amelia and this one caught my eye because she

593
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
The question in it

594
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:31,584
I don't think she meant it to be but it's actually kind of a legitimate question

595
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,400
And I thought that my twin sister could answer

596
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,824
She said that my intonation makes me sound uncertain of myself and that when I introduce myself it sounds as if I'm asked

597
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
A question like

598
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,408
I am Karen Duffin

599
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
Well

600
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
Illegal.

601
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,064
Cube indicate that you are definitely

602
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,344
Karen Duffin

603
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,928
But I can't say for sure that you are

604
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Why

605
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
Because

606
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
When we are born

607
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,816
Mom and dad did Mavis right away

608
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,608
So we just had wristbands

609
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,936
Listen baby girl number one in baby girl number two

610
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
So

611
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,264
You might be Marita

612
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,056
So Amelia is onto something

613
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,152
I know I'm really a thought she was just give me a little bit of advice

614
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
But really

615
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,480
She's uncovered a bigger mystery this is like

616
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,040
Connect serial

617
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,344
Next on serial

618
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,648
