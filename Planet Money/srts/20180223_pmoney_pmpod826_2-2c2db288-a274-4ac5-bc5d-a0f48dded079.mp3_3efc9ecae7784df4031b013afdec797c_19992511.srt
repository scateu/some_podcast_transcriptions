00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,024
Quick warning

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,328
This episode contains one curse word

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:11,008
So the other day I go to a bar O'Keefe's it's a standard Irish bar in Brooklyn with someone who I thought was a friend

4
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,056
Dance

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,104
And we got into an arc

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
Yeah that's true

7
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,688
I am telling you it is a real thing that happens

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,224
Just about every time

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,040
You're telling me

10
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:28,416
When you drink cheap vodka you have an allergic reaction when you drink expensive vodka are fine

11
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:34,048
I am allergic to cheap vodka that is my tank when I drink cheap vodka my my face turns red

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,840
He gets a little hard to breathe

13
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,400
Like just a little it's not like it's going to kill me I don't buy it

14
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240
You doubted my own personal plan

15
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
About my own personal hell

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,688
No offense Alex but I am just really skeptical okay I cover food for a living and I can tell you that vodkas are

17
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,712
Pretty much all the same

18
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,504
In fact they have to be

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,600
And I don't think otherwise is falling for one of the great sales jobs in modernist

20
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256

Look at the story of the marketing genius who created the whole concept of super premium vodka we will make our own vodka

27
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,224
Send it to a lab see how it measures up Bunsen burners

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
Lab coats

29
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
Liquor scientist and

30

Here it is Alex as an authentic paper sound effect

44
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
I'm about to read a lot

45
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
Break it off

46
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
This is title 27

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,016
Section 5 .22

48
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
All the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,112
Code this is the code Alex that

50
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,464
Aspiring vodka magnates read to their children at bedtime

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,768
It says that vodka must be distilled

52
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,304
Or treated until it is

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Is quote without

54
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Distinctive character

55
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
Aroma

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
Taste

57
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
Or color

58
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,264
The Taste but has no distinctive

59
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
Taste

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,432
If you're making bourbon you're going crazy trying to create a unique flavors your product will stand out

61
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,040
Right you're going to Asian certain barrels for a certain amount of time or whatever smokey

62
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
APD all those things

63
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,904
Making vodka is very little you're allowed to do

64
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
To make it taste

65
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Different

66
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,792
By law you basically have to make an industrial-grade

67
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
Pure alcohol

68
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,400
First like the stuff you put in edhesive Zara fragrances

69
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
Detergents

70
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,520
And all you do is add water

71
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
And you got Vodka

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,384
That doesn't sound right

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
To figure out if there's a difference between fancy

74
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Cheap vodka

75
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,064
Let's just start off by finding someone to show us how vodka

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
Is may make sense

77
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,928
Someone can show us how it all works standing right in front of their vodka making

78
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,024
Hey how are ya

79
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,888
This is ronak Parikh you are the guys who run industry City distillery in Brooklyn

80
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,448
He takes us down a long cluttered hallway pasta

81
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
The bar and then

82
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Unlocks

83
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
Big metal door

84
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
You're answering there still room now

85
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,592
There's like clear jugs all around there's this

86
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
One machine

87
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
Looks kind of like where you go to

88
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
Flip a circuit breaker to turn the power back on

89
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,480
Tubes coming out of it

90
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,296
Another one looks like an angry washing machine

91
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
I'm home

92
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
Can a cramp

93
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
Smaller than a dorm room

94
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
Yeah I mean there's like

95
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,720
Enough room for maybe two or three people to be working

96
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,024
Basically yeah which is about our team

97
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
Explain how to make vodka in a nutshell

98
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
First stop

99
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
That's very small

100
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
It's really straightforward science

101
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
You can buy in sugar

102
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
And yeast

103
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Do you eat the sugar

104
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
Oops out alcohol

105
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,127
But now that alcohol is sitting in a vat

106
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Put the sugar in it

107
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Easton junk

108
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
You got to separate it

109
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,807
So you heat the mixture just to the point of the alcohol turns to steam and Rises up

110
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,135
You do that a few times and you end up with basically pure alcohol

111
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,951
And every vodka Alex no matter how cheap

112
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
Has to be distilled to that point

113
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,071
These machines here the main purpose of them

114
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
Is to remove flavor

115
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
Incent

116
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
And any other

117
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
Characteristic except for

118
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,263
Alcohol exactly

119
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,335
Chemical constituents about Esther's they will create flavors

120
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,175
But in the case of vodka they will not be related to its bra material

121
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,247
By definition of the queso if you ever see

122
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
Packaging of State

123
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
This vodka is made

124
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:16,159
With Northwest Pacific grains kissed by the Colorado Rapids

125
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
DePaul marketing b*******

126
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
When it comes to vodka

127
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
Your raw material can I influence Final Four

128
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,631
The raw material doesn't matter to the final flavor

129
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
There is no flavor

130
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
But

131
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
How you

132
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
Treat that raw material

133
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Does effect

134
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
What's in

135
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
That's because there are three stages of

136
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
Three categories heads hearts and Tails

137
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
Heads hearts

138
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,551
Okay Raonic explain that when you start to heat the alcohol to distill

139
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,879
The first part of the steam that comes out before anything else

140
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
That part is called the hens

141
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
That part is not supposed to be for drinking

142
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:57,119
It's the stuff I can contain methanol the stuff that moonshine is our get in trouble with going blind even being fatally fatally hurt by

143
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,775
You don't want to drink your head you want to remove that and then the next part that's the good stuff the hearts so

144
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
List of Roanoke wants to keep

145
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
That is the vapor in the middle

146
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
And then

147
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:15,551
Okay that's the stuff that's potable but stuff that's been in our industry we known to I'll give you hangovers

148
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
In case of nasty smells maromas

149
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,183
It's a Run xidan if you want to make a super cheap vodka

150
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,743
You would probably just leave in extra tails

151
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,791
Because you get more vodka

152
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,631
Her run of the steel or whatever until Cost Less

153
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
And the best part

154
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,703
Because if you're a stickler for quality

155
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
They would take just

156
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
The hearts

157
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
So there is a

158
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,103
Yeah maybe

159
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
Seems like a good guy

160
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
But remember

161
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,455
He's also selling vodka for 40 bucks a bottle

162
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,527
So I don't think he's going to say that his the same as the $10 stuff

163
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
In the plastic bottle on the bottom shelf

164
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
1

165
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
Other interests

166
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:57,023
He was one of the only distillers who we called out who said sure come on down take a look around

167
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
And he says that's because it a lot of labels

168
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
They don't distill their own alcohol

169
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
They buy it in bulk

170
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
From someone else

171
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,519
I'm at soup so weird because it went every one of these vodkas we hear this

172
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,055
Fairy tale about how the

173
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:14,431
Craft Copper Still blah blah blah

174
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,319
But I set out to find out how bulk-buying works and it's true this is one company it's huge

175
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
Everyone in the liquor industry knows

176
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Ultra

177
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,719
They said they have the largest selection of bulk alcohol in the world

178
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,279
They sell basically pure alcohol like

179
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,327
Vodka concentrates a base

180
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,911
Lots of companies buy it and use it to make their own vodka brands

181
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
Some of the companies take the basin

182
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
Still at further they tweak it to put their own spin on

183
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,335
But ultrapure told me that the more price driven companies

184
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
They just take the base

185
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
Add Water

186
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
Business

187
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Best selling vodka

188
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
So I called him up and I said hey

189
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
Can I get some of that vodka concentrate

190
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
And they said yeah no problem samples are in the mail

191
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,647
While we were waiting for our samples to arrive

192
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
We went to find out how this whole

193
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Trend of

194
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
Fancy vodka.

195
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,047
Started because when you go to the liquor store you see

196
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,607
Ketel One and Belvedere and Ciroc all these

197
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,679
Smoky bottles and fancy design and high prices

198
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
Clearly vodka drinkers

199
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
I think that there's a day

200
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
Difference but there is one difference

201
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
The fonts

202
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
I'm a bottle

203
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:20,479
Very different Alex and this whole idea super premium vodkas it was all invented by one guy

204
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
He is a cop

205
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Classic

206
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
American businessman

207
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
And in almost a cliche

208
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,463
Good way than in bad way it's like

209
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
Came from nothing

210
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Poor

211
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,631
He went to Brown but he only went to Brown for one year because he couldn't afford it

212
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
This is Matthew Lackey

213
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,495
I'm a drink writer and the author of you suck at drinking

214
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,799
So how many drinks do you have

215
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
A day on average

216
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,919
Well I'm trying to come back

217
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,759
When I was at the height of my drink writing powers

218
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
Oh gosh

219
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
5 to 8

220
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
We are such amateurs

221
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Anyway

222
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:04,767
Sidney Frank drops out of college ends up marrying a woman from a wealthy family and her family business is

223
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
Liquor

224
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,095
So he kind of slides in the liquor business side

225
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,631
In love

226
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,447
Liquor necessarily just looking for Niche products

227
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,007
And he stumbles on this

228
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,567
Side bar refuses old German

229
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Folks

230
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Drinking Jagermeister

231
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,687
Which is the time this is an 80s

232
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
With selling like 500 cases

233
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Does a year

234
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Nothing

235
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Nothing at all

236
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,367
So Sydney Frank buys the rights to import Jagermeister

237
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,951
That's sort of herbal taste kind of like

238
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
Black licorice cost

239
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,047
Which probably explains the low sales

240
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:44,447
And he buys it precisely because it isn't well-known and it doesn't do much beyond the old German man Market

241
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
For a while

242
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:50,079
But then he hears about students at Louisiana State University actually liking Jaeger my

243
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,919
There's an article in the local paper that says all the kids know this is what you drink

244
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
When you want to get

245
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
One of them described as liquid volume

246
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,807
And that was what kicked off you would like

247
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
Kollege Kidd

248
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:05,951
And with Jagermeister he essentially invents all of the garbage

249
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
We may know about liquor companies and their marketing practice

250
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
This is now he's basically invented

251
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
He sponsored party

252
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
He Butters up bar

253
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,495
Even set up a team of scantily clad women to give away free shots

254
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
Skip Gathering

255
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
The Yeager at

256
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,615
That was a Sydney Frank special right there so

257
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
The other kind of guerrilla marketing

258
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,015
You know he doesn't play by any of the normal rules so

259
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
Just to put a button on Alex

260
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Case it wasn't clear

261
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,159
Sidney Frank took a drink popular with old German men

262
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,487
And turned it into the hottest drink for the party set on College camp

263
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
And if you did that

264
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
He set his sights higher

265
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Aardvark

266
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
And at the time the fanciest vodka around

267
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
Was apps

268
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
Had a great marketing

269
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
Campaign but by today's standards

270
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
Wasn't really an expensive bottle

271
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Vodka

272
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
And that's what Sidney Frank knows is his

273
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Competition

274
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
But the thing he focuses on

275
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
It's not the taste of absolute

276
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Of course it is the price

277
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,575
The century out of thin air cuz I want to make a vodka

278
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,647
So absent Church in 15 or church 30

279
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,183
You didn't even have a product

280
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
At this point

281
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,255
But he already knows he's going to charge double

282
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,303
In order to do that he needs a product

283
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
Screams luxury

284
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:20,191
Chevy the best everything everything that is the best comes from France

285
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
Sippy cup

286
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
France

287
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,311
Any looks around for the Steelers as can you make vodka

288
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
Find somebody says yes of course I can

289
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,199
Make vodka bars with his French vodka making it seem special

290
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,759
He made a big deal that it was made a French weed

291
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
All kinds of things

292
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,599
Designed to make Grey Goose seem different from other vodka

293
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,927
He would give them the bottle in the wooden box

294
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
Drawings

295
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
Poseidon nicely package

296
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
Large

297
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
Clear bottle with the frost

298
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
Glass

299
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,119
Can you put it up on the back bar would catch whatever light

300
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
Who's there

301
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Hello

302
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
It's not that he didn't care about taste

303
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
At all

304
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
It's just that you didn't start there

305
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
He did

306
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,335
Submit it to the bti which

307
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Is the beverage

308
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
Tasting Institute

309
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:07,039
And it was awarded the best tasting vodka in the world and whatever 90 early 90s thing

310
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
And use that in his marketing

311
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
A lot

312
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,927
We reached out to Grey Goose for comment on this story

313
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
And didn't get back to us in time to include

314
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
Sydney Frank's whole plan worked

315
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,143
Back is now the most popular liquor in America and he died a very

316
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
He sold

317
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Grey Goose

318
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
2 Bacardi

319
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,519
Less than 10 years after he started it for more than two

320
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:33,151
And before you even start honest and I'm tempted to start now that I see how this whole

321
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,759
Story argues that that it's just marketing that all vodkas are the same that my allergy

322
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
Too cheap vodkas that I genuinely feel

323
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
Is all just in my

324
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
But I think

325
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,023
I scientifically as we can that's right and I got good news Alex cuz guess we're just arrived in the mail

326
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,935
I guess if I could concentrate that in order from ultrapure and I picked at one particular I think you can be excited about

327
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Okay

328
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,287
Ultrapure sells a vodka concentrate made in France

329
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
With French wheat

330
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
4 times distilled

331
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,175
Sounds pretty good I didn't say sounds like

332
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
Could be the best

333
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,783
The best that comes from France exactly Alex that's right

334
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,599
Outlook ultra-pure told us they don't sell to Greg

335
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,183
Something similar there aren't that many vodka distilleries

336
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
In France

337
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,487
We're not talking about wineries

338
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Okay

339
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,583
And 4 time to still sounds good to me maybe even

340
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Premium

341
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
I would go so far as to call it

342
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:31,007
Super premium Alex another we're going to do right now we can make our own Super premium vodka

343
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
I know this looks like

344
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
I get travel shampoo bottle size bottle

345
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
I would very clear liquid in it

346
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,527
And the wrapping bubble wrap and tape that's what we're taking off now

347
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
The label some kind of homemade go down

348
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,391
Yes they look like they were printed on somebody's incheon

349
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,719
Yeah but not even with the like the right alignment their cut off year

350
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,375
We've got this very handy fancy highly scientific graduated cylinder

351
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
That Planet Money owns

352
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
Going back to our story on class action lawsuit

353
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,055
Here comes the part of this entire store that I have most been dreading

354
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
What

355
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
Math

356
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:12,479
Grey Goose and most vodkas are 80 proof which means 40% alcohol

357
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:17,599
These battles are not some even easy to work with number there 192 proof

358
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,647
So we got to bring those down

359
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
284

360
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
Proof by adding water

361
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:28,863
It's 192 proof so if we have to make too hard because

362
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,447
Not 100% anything that we heard your math major

363
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,567
Okay and what are you cutting it with again water

364
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Water

365
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,127
Petrified water we got from the drugstore

366
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
This isn't how you make vodka

367
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
So we bottled are homemade French wheat vodka

368
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
Sterilize bottle and send it to a lab

369
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,071
Could you want to see what measures up

370
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,119
Thing is tested against

371
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Something right Alex

372
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
Sure Naturally

373
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
So we also sent

374
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Some Grey Goose

375
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
In an unmarked bottle

376
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,871
And we decided to send them some of the cheap stuff the Alex special bottom shelf

377
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
Plastic bottle

378
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,455
Reset the whole thing to San Diego

379
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
Go to a place called

380
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:22,367
This is a whole Lab where they test different types of alcohol which I think Alex is something you and I

381
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Play sometime ourselves

382
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,463
Especially this week for this episode

383
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
After the break

384
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
The results

385
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,583

To get our results be called up Neva Parker she's a vice president are white labs

395
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,143
Did I just curious do they look professional

396
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,471
Did we look like a good vodka start up to you when you took them out

397
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
Absolutely

398
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,663
That's gratifying vodka samples through what they call a comprehensive Spirits test it measured

399
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,967
Chemicals in the alcohol the people might be able to taste

400
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
Also test for chemicals that

401
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
Just shouldn't be

402
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
We sent them three bottles with no labels just a number

403
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
Number one was Grey Goose

404
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,511
Number two was our homemade French with vodka and number three was the bottom shelf plastic bottle

405
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
At neighbor said one of the vodkas

406
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Stood out

407
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
Because I did more of this one specific compound

408
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
It's called 1-propanol

409
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
And that's not a good thing

410
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
You want less of it

411
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
Vodka

412
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,359
I'm typically when you taste 1-propanol bats

413
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,991
More of that harsher alcohol kind of grainy alcohol compound

414
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,063
Rights of the Vodka that has more of that stuff is not as good

415
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
According to this

416
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
So it's

417
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
Possible

418
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
And that.

419
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,719
So is that maybe this product was Indus

420
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
Build as many times or distilled

421
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,327
2

422
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,423
Have the other two would have lower level

423
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,495
Which of these three vodkas would you suspect

424
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,031
Should be the

425
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Cheapest

426
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
Least desirable vodka

427
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,151
Grey Goose is number one

428
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
Homemade vodka is number 2

429
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,527
And the cheap stuff in a plastic bottle is number three

430
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
If I had to

431
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,415
Choose based on this analysis alone

432
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
I would say number one

433
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,535
And which would be the ultra-luxury choice

434
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
Number three

435
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,399
303 is the best

436
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,447
Vodka that money can buy at least

437
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,031
She said the plastic bottle of vodka seems like the best

438
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Wow

439
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
And Grey Goose

440
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Seems like

441
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
The cheapest

442
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,943
But our homemade vodka

443
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
Was pretty good

444
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,783
It was right up there with both of these provide

445
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,623
I mean look at bees they all look very similar as well

446
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,927
So would you say that ours is basically Grey Goose

447
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Yes I would

448
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,327
So we basically McGregor's

449
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
To be clear

450
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,911
Neighbor said that all three of these vodka

451
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
They had less of this

452
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,519
Bad stuff than anyone was really going to be able to

453
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
Taste

454
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,591
But you did say and I like to fart

455
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
That

456
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,175
Trace Amounts of any compound in a vodka

457
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,479
Could be enough to set off an allergy

458
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
Like maybe

459
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
Making your face turn red

460
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
When you're drinking

461
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Cheap vodka

462
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
Alex so I can

463
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,927
Speak that but the bottom line for me

464
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
Science shows

465
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
If you don't have an allergy

466
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
All vodkas are pretty much

467
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,327
And if you do there is one more time

468
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,167
All right I'll get you moved on to drink number to how you feeling

469
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,263
I actually do feel the redness coming on your tummy I don't have it

470
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
I mean look Alex

471
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
You convinced me

472
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:59,967
I think what we have learned here today is that the differences between cheap and expensive vodkas made tastable

473
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,015
For most people maybe not even for you

474
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
Put that you're delicate

475
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,855
Constitution may be sensitive to them

476
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
On the inside

477
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
Brother polite way of saying

478
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
A lot of music

479
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,607
But I appreciate that

480
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
And I will take it

481
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
I never did turn right that night

482
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,287
Couldn't say

483
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039

If you are looking for a new podcast to try can I recommend the sporkful Dan podcast

495
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:07,551
You sure can Alex I'll accept that recommendation yeah we just didn't episode all about MSG monosodium glutamate

496
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
And we looked into the

497
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,135
Faulty science and yes racism

498
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,951
That led to so many misconceptions about MSG

And a correction

503
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,727
In an earlier edition of this podcast we said that Grey Goose

504
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
What's 4 *

505
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
