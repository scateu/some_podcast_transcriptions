00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,816
Back in 2011 Sonja trauss

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:05,376
Was 29 year old living in St Louis

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,912
And she was at a kind of

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,680
Crossroad

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,496
She just failed out of a Ph.D program if you can.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,056
Really did not want to go home to fill it up

7
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:18,688
Because I have left being Lexia guys only get a PhD and I just couldn't go home after that

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,320
You're not getting it she moved in with her dad's cousin for a few months in El Cerrito just north of Berkeley

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
California

10
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,624
Got a job teaching math

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,160
At a community college in Marin

12
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,952
Marin County is super

13
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,744
Expensive like most areas around

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,768
San Francisco Bay

15
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,304
So she found a place

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
In Oakland

17
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,608
And her commute was

18
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,376
Terrible

19
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,192
So she spends hours every week

20
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,984
On our way to work with that

21
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,008
Economist brain

22
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,032
Spinning

23
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,592
Calculating I made $20 an hour

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,456
But I calculated my real wage when I took into account how much it cost to get there and how much

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
Aurora News 12

26
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
So I put that job

27
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,392
And got a job in a bakery where I made 1250 an hour

28
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
I wanted to move

29
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,280
But I couldn't even afford to move until I was reading the paper about people who are Jews

30
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
His place because

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072
They couldn't afford

32
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
Stay

33
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
And I was like this place

34
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,656
And terrible you can't afford to

35
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,216
Stay if you want to leave you can't afford to leave

36
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,776
Cuz you can't save any money because moving costs

37
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,080
It just felt so grim

38
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,384
And everybody in the Bay Area and and

39
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,456
Big city now knows a horror story about housing

40
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,992
And a lot of them are way worse

41
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
If the garage is p

42
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
Cars

43
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
Poor shelters

44
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
Some people just take it as a fact

45
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,184
San Francisco has

46
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,744
Expensive housing the same way it has fog

47
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Just does

48
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,048
What Sonja trauss doesn't take

49
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
Granted not after all those years

50
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
And economics

51
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,496
One Night in 2014 she's walking down the street in San Francisco on her way to hear some music

52
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
China bar

53
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,080
And in the window of that bark she sees a sign

54
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,128
She seen me signs here and there in the neighborhood

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,944
It says help us stop this developer

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
From building a big new apart

57
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,272
And that's not

58
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
It makes her so

59
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Mad

60
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,720
Like trigger something in Huracan brand because she's thinking that apartment building is exactly what I need it's what the whole

61
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
Sitting

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Will the housing shortage

63
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,584
The way you fix a shortage build more housing

64
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
So simple

65
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
And at that moment

66
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
Looking at that sign

67
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,216
She thinks

68
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,008
The people who put that sign up

69
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,544
They probably own home

70
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
They're not struggling.

71
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
They're making things worse for the rest of us

72
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
And she cried

73
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,016
I was just like screw you guys like I know what you

74
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,088
Do you make posters you write letters

75
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
You go to hearing

76
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Thanks

77
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:42,048
So I saw that side and I was like I'm going to make signs to you know I'm going to make a website to

78
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:48,448
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Dan Charles how to fix the housing crisis

79
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,752
Dark Side of those cities that seem so great

80
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
Until you actually have to live there

81
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,360
Rent you can afford skyrocketing home prices

82
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,456
All kinds of ways to make housing affordable out of those things

83
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Don't work very well

84
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
There is a solution now

85
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,112
It's simple it really works only problem is just about everybody hates it

86
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
Including maybe the most powerful bunch of

87
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,256
People in the country do we dare speak their name

There was something but Sonja trauss found

99
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
Really weird when she first got in

100
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:47,584
This housing fight it was how people just were not talking about the one thing she thought would do the most

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
Sound like

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,936
Silly but it is really really

103
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
True that

104
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,728
You could not

105
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Play company

106
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
You could not come out and say

107
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
I think

108
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,944
We need more housing I think development might be a good thing you could not say that it was ghost

109
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
Now that's not complete

110
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
There were Builders who are saying

111
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
What you need is more Construction

112
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
Let us do it

113
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,648
But why should we listen to greedy developers they just want to make money

114
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
Sonia's feeling was

115
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
Okay so they're greedy

116
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
So what

117
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:21,887
Well I don't see what the point is in moralizing something like that like it doesn't seem like it helps the problem

118
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:26,239
I actually think that's why I went into economics because economics

119
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,335
Generally it is that one of the values that underlies it is that

120
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
Moralizing about people's behavior

121
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
Isn't super productive

122
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,015
Yeah there's another popular response to housing crisis

123
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
Rent control rent control

124
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,111
San Francisco has tried it a lot of cities try it

125
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
You just make a law that says

126
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
You can't raise the rent

127
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,279
Antonio says that is all well and good if you happen to be living in one of those rankings

128
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
But it's not enough

129
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
You still need to sell the shortage

130
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
Right around this time she comes across an article in the news

131
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
A quotes an economist

132
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
Enrico Moretti who as it happens lives

133
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
Right in her backyard at the University of California

134
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Berkeley

135
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,919
I'm already is quoted in this article saying

136
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,247
People here in the Bay Area should be Marching for more housing

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
He identified exactly

138
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,623
What the problem was and he was the only way this is going to get solved

139
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
Is if citizens groups

140
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Start

141
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
That asked for housing

142
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
It was like a call to Arms

143
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:26,655
Address just to her start that group make those posters build the movement to give capitalist

144
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
What's the chance

145
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
So she sent them an email

146
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
And I was like you wrote about us

147
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,383
You know you predicted that this is a thing that could happen within the needs to happen and it's happening now

148
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
What did you think

149
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,247
When you got this invitation from Sonja trauss

150
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,295
I was pleased that was organizing

151
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Is event

152
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
And that she invited

153
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
Even though he acts

154
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
I couldn't make it

155
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Office hour slots

156
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Two PowerPoints

157
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,791
When I talked to Andre comb already on Skype he was way off in the Alps on vacation

158
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119
But still thinking about those housing prices in California

159
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:03,007
Fundamentally the problem of housing cost in the Bay Area is a problem of demand and supply

160
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,591
It sounds so basic lots of people want to live there and not enough time to go around

161
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,383
And it's a self-inflicted shortage

162
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,199
Local governments have made it hard to build housing

163
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,015
Does restrictive zoning neighborhood councils get to up

164
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Object file endless apps

165
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:20,159
Even against something like a modest little building in the most convenient of location

166
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
Deposition tube

167
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Even

168
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
You know Toy Story that elements next

169
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
The train station

170
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
Remain fierce

171
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Haha

172
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
And I really don't

173
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
1st and Noe Dunkin Donuts

174
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
Position

175
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,823
When governments create a housing shortage this way don't just make life miserable for people

176
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,479
It forces people into decisions that hurt the whole economy maybe nurses abandon their jobs in San Francisco the Whole Health

177
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,575
Meridiana Kali put a price tag on the local housing District

178
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
And it was astounding

179
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
They calculated that over the last 50 years

180
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Three cities

181
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,487
San Francisco San Jose in New York

182
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
They cut their growth rates

183
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
I artificially driving up the cost

184
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
Across the entire American economy

185
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
A trillion and a half.

186
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,959
So the problem

187
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
Israel it's

188
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Huge

189
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
And here's how you organize the saw

190
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
Step one former Club

191
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
Give me the name of the catchy Act

192
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,967
Can I call the SF Bay Area renters Federation sfr

193
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,063
Lovett step to invite people to party start. Getting angry together

194
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Kind of fun

195
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,439
I met Laura Clark at one of those parties she was one of the first people to join up with some

196
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
Oh yeah Sonia was

197
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:33,375
She was angry first and I got the girl run around and be like yeah yeah I'm going to go do what she's doing

198
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,935
We're going to go yell and it'll respond

199
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Exciting

200
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,263
Go get a drink and then we'll like

201
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,567
You know gossip local politics and

202
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
Make it into a whole event

203
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
The anger bonding was real

204
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
And it felt like it was a battle of

205
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Generation

206
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,063
Renters versus owners young people demanding change

207
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
Against old people

208
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,647
Good dinner wildin like your neighborhood

209
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
Just fine the way it was

210
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,999
Derogatory name for people who don't want new stuff in their neighborhood

211
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,559
Nimbi NIMBY not in my backyard

212
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
Sonia and her friends

213
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Call themselves

214
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
Yimby yes in my backyard

215
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
You're so much more friendly

216
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
Step 3 go to meetings

217
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Sign up to talk

218
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
Hi

219
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
My name is

220
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:18,431
This was a city planning meeting in West Oakland four years ago when Tony was just getting started

221
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
She walked up to the microphone

222
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Tank top

223
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
Colorful tights

224
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
New houses

225
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Cars rent

226
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Thrive

227
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
No

228
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,975
Rising winds

229
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
Call capitalist

230
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Houses

231
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
She's like an exasperated math

232
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,191
Teacher hurt her speech was pretty much the same everywhere

233
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,239
Build as much as possible as

234
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Fastest

235
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,615
But the people she was fighting against we're different depending on the neighborhood

236
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
In working-class play

237
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
Places like West Oakland

238
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,711
People were suspicious of new development

239
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Because they worried that it would mean

240
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
Richard people

241
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
Why people would take over the neighborhood

242
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
If your voice

243
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,671
Landlords would take this is an upscale neighborhood now maybe I will

244
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
Evict my tenant

245
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Building

246
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,279
My money so their other places.

247
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,583
Like wealthier parts of Berkeley in San Francisco

248
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:12,959
There it was people with multimillion-dollar homes you didn't want new development because of it noise

249
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Construction

250
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,823
Bigger buildings messing up their quiet streets and beautiful views

251
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
NIMBY

252
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
It seemed like everybody had a different reason.

253
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
Tuseno

254
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Not here

255
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
And I say it loud

256
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
Right into a microphone

257
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Recorded for pasta

258
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
Yes there are tapes

259
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,343
Lordy this is like SportsCenter highlights

260
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,623
Local democracy in action

261
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,671
Tete-a-tete

262
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
The meeting in Berkeley

263
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
The 10th last night

264
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,303
A developer wanted to put up a big new apartment building where there used to be a drugstore

265
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,143
And some people didn't like it said this monstrosity will block

266
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,007
The great view Sonia was there with some of her yimby friends and one of the other speakers turned on them

267
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,055
I also want to say that this little group

268
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
People over here

269
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,223
Is led by a woman who supposedly from what I understand lives in Oakland

270
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,575
And goes around to Albany San Francisco and Berkeley

271
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,903
Talking about the development just because she loves it so

272
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
We don't really know where she's getting her life

273
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
Because she will tell us

274
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Wait

275
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
You have your

276
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,983
This can only be a friend group

277
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
Roosevelt

278
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Personals ads

279
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,919
Are you going to let me have my time and then Kristoff and after

280
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,503
Sonja trauss got to the microphone and few minutes later

281
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
When you shop for housing

282
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
Glenwood says

283
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Piano first lesson

284
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,903
Deposit and actually you know what I want

285
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
The front

286
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,511
Feel like I can't do that or else you can rent

287
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
How many units are there open

288
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
That's very powerless position

289
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
Please don't push us this powerless position

290
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
Property values go up

291
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
When you don't build enough

292
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,823
It's that econ Branigan

293
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,199
She's thinking if the homeowners keep new homes off the market their own homes are worth more

294
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
You can say I'm a developer but

295
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,063
I think that you're here as a greeting homeowners

296
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,135
So she and her friends were saying bill bill bill

297
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,439
Private development government subsidized housing

298
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:14,047
We want it all and more and more other people were saying things that were kind of similar

299
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
The mayor of San Francisco

300
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Thai medley

301
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
He said what's it at Target

302
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
5000 new housing units

303
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,263
So it really seemed like progress but

304
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,079
When it came to real decisions there were a lot of set

305
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
Prince a couple of years after she started her

306
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,199
Grip the San Francisco Board of Supervisors

307
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,783
Which is what they call their city council was considering a new law

308
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
It would have allowed taller buildings

309
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,135
Denser housing into residential

310
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
Sweat the housing areas called zoning

311
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
I'm sending Bill and Sonia was a big fan

312
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
But at Community meetings around town

313
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,583
It did not go over well

314
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,887
It was terrible every

315
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
Meeting

316
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
Everybody who spoke up

317
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Totally against

318
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,055
Another meeting

319
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,383
Hey sup was fierce over new condo building in the heart of the mission

320
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
Now seriously

321
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
You may know the mission

322
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:07,807
The working-class Latina neighborhood gentrifying a lot of people don't like that they didn't like the new condo building either

323
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
Like Scott Weaver from the Latino cultural disc

324
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
City council

325
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,719
Valencia Street you can have a meal for $5,200

326
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
Person you can buy fancy

327
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
The clothes you can spend $350

328
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
Forehand

329
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
These are not the types of businesses

330
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,239
That belong in the Latino Cultural District

331
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Sanya got up

332
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
She laid into the building

333
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,871
And when you come here to the Board of Supervisors

334
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,711
And say that you don't want new different people in your neighborhood

335
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,319
You're exactly the same as Americans all over the country that don't want immigrants

336
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,671
It is it is the same attitude it is exactly.

337
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
That's one supervisor who said he

338
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Come to the meeting

339
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
Intending to vote for the building

340
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,863
Now he wouldn't just because he didn't want to be on the same side of the issue is Sonia

341
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
The vote was 9 to nothing to delay

342
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,287
Fernando Marti had been on the opposite side of Sonja trauss at a lot of these meeting

343
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,127
Is the co-director of the Council of community housing organizations on the group

344
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Fighting gentrify

345
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
Application in the mission

346
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
And he has two basic disagreement

347
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
The Emmys one of them is

348
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,111
The emps complain a lot about neighborhood making it hard to

349
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Building

350
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:20,255
But Fernando says that's not the main reason there's a shortage of housing he says the big problem is

351
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,351
It's just really really expensive to build anything in the Central District

352
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
San Francisco is so expensive

353
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,959
The only kind of housing that developers can figure out how to

354
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,519
Finance is high-end Condos for rich people

355
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
They would build

356
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,591
Cheaper if they could but they can't

357
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
So they just build for that top

358
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
2%

359
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,455
The other thing that gets on his nerves is when these

360
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,783
Mostly young mostly white mostly educated DMVs

361
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,087
Adopt a language of civil rights

362
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,415
When they say the way Sonja said in that meeting that

363
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,511
You know folks in the mission are like nativist trying to keep new people out of their neighbor

364
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,815
I think people who have

365
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,631
Seen the effects of

366
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
Redlining

367
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Gentrify

368
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Vacation

369
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
And eviction

370
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
They want to be able

371
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,079
Shape their own community and shape what

372
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
Comes in

373
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,919
Sonia isn't apologizing for what she said at that meeting

374
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
But she was

375
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Listening

376
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
She changed her mind about so

377
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,575
It started with something that she read

378
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
Probably scanning hurt

379
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,183
Somebody who's associated with Mission activist

380
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
Was saying

381
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
It's not fair

382
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
That all the housing is going

383
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
The mission

384
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
And not

385
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
The Westside

386
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
And I thought

387
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
True

388
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
That isn't fair

389
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
That's a great point

390
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
She realized she'd been thinking too small

391
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
Cheap spend so much time going to where the arguments were

392
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,871
Four arguments over this with that building

393
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,943
But the arguments weren't even happening in most of the city

394
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,759
The quiet residential part of the city mostly on the western

395
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,111
There were no arguments because you couldn't even think about building an apartment building there

396
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
Because of zoning rules

397
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,463
She realized to make a real difference those rules had

398
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,839
So that's the new yimby campaign their new slogan legalized housing everywhere

399
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
Not just because it's fair

400
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
But because

401
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
It's cheaper

402
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,727
You can add a lot of new apartments in these residential play

403
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
Places without having to build those

404
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,079
Expensive high-rises made of concrete

405
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,431
Insteel actually solving our problem in California and probably anywhere in the US

406
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
Is only going to happen

407
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
If we

408
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
Allow

409
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
Miles and miles

410
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Acres and Acres

411
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
Of single-family large light neighborhoods

412
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
To become places

413
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
With mixed housing

414
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,303
People need to be able to allow their single family homes

415
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
Turn down

416
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
And build a fourplex

417
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Maybe even if

418
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
10 unit

419
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:39,519
Garden Apartments so the new and latest phase of this campaign to make new construction cool

420
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
She's going after the suburbs

421
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
I'm serious when I say everywhere

422
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
Not kidding

423
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
There's a town sitting right on Annex

424
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,247
Expensive Commuter Rail Line it will not allow some apartment buildings

425
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
Let's get built

426
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
Sanya suing them

427
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,135
And in the past year so they can be said even started making some political progress

428
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
Remember that proposed

429
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:02,559
Is law that was going to maybe allow denser housing Construction in parts of residential service

430
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,655
With the housing people call up zoning such a hostile

431
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,215
Perception when they introduced it in 2000

432
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,799
16 about a year later when they went around again

433
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:18,687
By that time Jimmy's had started organizing in some of the West Side neighborhood

434
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,503
And so the second round of community meeting

435
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,343
There were like three or five you know half a dozen

436
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Jimmy's

437
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
People who said I think this might be a good idea

438
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,231
I think this could help our neighbor

439
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
And just having them there

440
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,863
Wheatley change the possibilities for the bill

441
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,935
Last year the supervisors passed it 11 to 0

442
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,775
When it finally passed it was the first time

443
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
Ever

444
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
In the history of

445
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
The universe

446
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,687
That there had been an up zoning in the westside of Saint Francis

447
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:55,295
I just a couple of months ago San Francisco elected a new mayor London breed

448
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,343
Should grown up in public housing in the city

449
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
And she made more housing a big part of our

450
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Right away

451
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
In her inauguration speech

452
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
She sounded a lot like AUB

453
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
The politics of no has

454
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
Play Garth City for farts

455
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Too long

456
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,447
Not on my block not in my backyard

457
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
We have made a mistake

458
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,055
It's in the past by not moving housing production

459
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,847
Fort Worth all over this

460
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,687
And I plan to change the politics of no to the

461
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
The politics of yes

462
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
Yes we will build more houses

463
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,087
That is the new mayor of San Francisco

464
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
Insomnia trial

465
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,951
She is running for a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors

466
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,535
The elections in November she's got three more months to make her case
