1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,864
And I can't use bad language on your program

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,912
Can I have the weather

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,752
Wearing a Nobel Laureate uses bad language on the show today

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,824
On the morning that the Nobel Prize

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,152
In economics was awarded this year I got up really early

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,432
I'm so excited I I

7
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,456
I pick up my phone

8
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,248
Open it check it and

9
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:24,064
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,344
Has decided

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,904
To award the various Rick

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,720
Spark prize in economic Sciences

13
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,768
In memory of Alfred Nobel

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
2

15
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,328
Oliver Hart

16
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,864
Ambank Alstrom

17
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,424
For their contributions

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,448
To contract

19
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,216
Theory

20
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,264
And

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
I went back to bed

22
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
Contract theory tours they don't even sound good separately contract and you got theories like a lose-lose

23
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,736
Planning on skipping

24
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
No we don't have to do a show every year on the Nobel Prize

25
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,856
Robert you have this

26
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,136
Yeah

27
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,416
Tim Harford

28
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
Economist lives in the UK Big Planet Money All Star wrote the book undercover Economist we love him

29
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,864
He just happened to be in town

30
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,984
The same week econ Nobel was giving up and just wrote a book called

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Messi

32
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776
Edit

33
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,056
Clever ways to be

34
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,384
More creative it's about finding new techniques to solve

35
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,688
Old difficult problem

36
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,736
Which is what we had with the Nobel Prize

37
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
So we has Hartford

38
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
Can you be our adviser

39
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,856
You know we don't want you to explain the Nobel

40
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
But we want you to give us some like creative techniques we can use so we can explain the Nobel in some kind of a fun interesting

41
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
Creative way

42
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,864
It's difficult because this year it's really mathematical

43
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,680
Really inside baseball

44
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
And also

45
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,800
Everybody comes out with a really quick take on what these guys did

46
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,336
Why they won the prize

47
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
Until you feel coming late to a really difficult story that everyone's already done

48
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
Wow will you put it that way

49
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:59,808
More out than ever

50
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
So

51
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,696
See what my help is it because I am now a creative Guru yes

52
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
Tim Harford redo

53
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Watch out

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,584
So they awarded them the price you want to send a Swedish accent no

55
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Good choice

56
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
Hello

57
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:25,664
Show we use mystical magical techniques to unleash the creativity living with anusol

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,992
Slash to talk about contract theory in the econ Nobel

59
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,296
Which also has a little magic inside

60
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
Support for this

61
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,512

Or downloading the award-winning app

69
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,368
So Hartford you know this already but like

70
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,184
Are typical Nobel Prize show would be

71
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
Call the prizewinners call bengt holmstrom Oliver Hardy interview them do a lot of writing maybe come up with some practical applications

72
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,960
But we've been doing this for 8 years now and it's like it's starting to feel like a slob

73
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,520
And I think we liked about your book is that it

74
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,568
Talked about people who are stuck

75
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
In this rot

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
And it said

77
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:33,504
Where you can find creativity is essentially a force people to look at problems differently

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
Yeah if you

79
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:39,392
Set people a seemingly impossible all weird problem

80
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:44,000
Suddenly they stop saying everything fresh they like a tourist in a completely new city

81
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,072
At you're going to get somewhere fresh because you're starting somewhere

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
So Hartford

83
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
Famous huge fan of you

84
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,240
Of your work I'm delighted that you here but I have to say like

85
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,104
As much as I want to sort of shake off the I'm a little skeptical that there's just some like

86
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
You know one weird trick that's going to completely

87
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,968
You don't transform the show

88
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,552
I know you're probably right there probably isn't one weird trick but

89
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:14,208
Lots of examples of people who have found ways to be more creative to attend

90
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
Something they didn't know they had

91
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,863
One version of this that we really liked from the book and it was super simple it's a

92
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
If a deck of cards

93
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,727
With substring sentences written on them is called

94
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Oblique strategies

95
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,103
And the creator of the stack of cards is none of a van

96
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
Brian Eno

97
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
And now ha Philistines

98
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,063
Assange who's he and the other half is super excited because Brian is a very interesting guy he's a musician

99
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:45,439
About his own right and he produces all the musicians that have been involved in some amazing albums

100
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,255
But what he often does in the studio

101
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,327
His to push his fellow musician out of that comfort zone

102
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,351
Thigh

103
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Annie's cards

104
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
I need instructions on the couch

105
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,311
Very mysterious and Dracula almost

106
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
Water

107
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,711
Go outside shut the door

108
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
Or

109
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
Twist the spine

110
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,343
And then consulted magicians episode guide

111
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Ordinances that mean

112
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
But he got amazing results

113
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,303
U2 with David Bowie

114
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
With Phil Collins

115
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Amazing musician

116
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:31,519
Although they would always happy with what I was doing so at one point Collins for Goblin so frustrated with

117
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:37,407
And he's stupid instructions from the card he started throwing beer cans across the studio I feel that

118
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
Coming in the air tonight

119
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
Okay so Tim we wanted to try these oblique strategies with you we're going have you draw a card

120
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119
And then whatever says on there we promise we are going to fall out

121
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
The instructions

122
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Okay

123
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,775
The proper oblique strategies are beautiful Adecco

124
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
A crisp

125
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,615
White cons about the size of business cards

126
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
In a black

127
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
Leather case

128
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
But I did not bring that with me to New York

129
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,039
7 said I have the oblique strategies app on my phone

130
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
Just drove a car

131
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:21,695
I said it's it's just it's an app that has oblique strategies it's black and white so I'm just going to tap

132
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
Tricard

133
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
What context would look right

134
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
What county

135
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
Would look right

136
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,751
That's a very Planet Money question right there yeah it's a very Planet Money question so

137
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,567
In a way that's that's all most notably kanouff

138
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,407
It feels almost too easy so we're basically saying

139
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
Let's talk about the history of the prize

140
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,527
This price is controversial

141
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,623
We can talk about that that's even a book out at the moment about

142
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
How

143
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,719
Buy Avenue off of another wolf how

144
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,767
The Nobel Prize by City

145
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,863
Was trying to engineer political change in

146
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
Sweden

147
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
After offer

148
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,775
Oxford economic historian author of a new book on the history of the econ Nobel

149
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
Welcome to Planet Money

150
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
How long

151
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,871
Are we going to be here

152
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
Oh 45 minutes

153
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:19,039
Excellent okay

154
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:25,439
25 minutes of already know this but the Nobel Prize

155
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,511
Is an economics was not originally one of the Nobel prizes

156
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
Haters love to point that out all winter every year you know all of them except economics

157
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
We're first given out in 1901

158
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,543
And nobody even thought about Anakin prize until the 19th

159
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,895
It comes about because the Central Bank of Sweden was in a fight

160
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
With the parliament of Sweden

161
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,479
Yeah the head of the Swedish Central Bank

162
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,039
He wants Parliament to basically leave the bank alone

163
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
Disney Paris

164
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
And he comes up with this plan

165
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
To get what he wants

166
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,743
Is inspiration is why don't we create a Nobel prize in economics

167
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Why economics

168
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
A Nobel prize in economics

169
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
Would endow

170
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
The policies

171
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
Of the Swedish Central Bank

172
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
With the authority of science

173
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,823
Comparable to physics comparable to Medicine

174
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,151
It is no longer the expression of the

175
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,967
Interest of Swedish business

176
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
And Swedish Finance

177
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
This is

178
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
Impartial Independence

179
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
It's like wearing a lab coat to work so that people will respect you more call you doctor

180
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
That is a slide rule

181
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,375
They want to create this nobility, and they have a lot of money

182
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,959
But you can't just go out and create a new Nobel Prize

183
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:47,359
You have to get the approval of the Nobel fan of somebody named know about so people from the central bank they go to me

184
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
With the fam

185
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
The

186
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,039
Senior member of the noble family is a 97 year old lady

187
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,831
Who is called Martha

188
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
And when they come to her she says

189
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
I will not have

190
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,767
A Nobel prize in economics she says no

191
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,863
I'm not aware that she says no but she makes a condition

192
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,447
And the condition is that it should not be called a Nobel Prize

193
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:20,127
So so she says you can't you do you got the Nobel Prize in physics Nobel Prize in medicine you cannot call this the

194
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
The Nobel prize in economics

195
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,759
Soap feel like okay we're going to call it the smelliest

196
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,575
Spunk prize in economic Sciences

197
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
In memory of Alfred Nobel

198
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:37,023
Not a Nobel Prize but the word Nobel he's in there somewhere

199
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,607
But you know it's it's unclear to me whether

200
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
This whole

201
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679
Wu's it's a little bit of a ruse

202
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,287
Worked what do they did manage to dress up economics in that lab coat

203
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,359
You know there are a lot of things are we sure about economics

204
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,407
Where it is clearly not

205
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,759
Like a hard science like physics right like like public policy you know you can't

206
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,831
Run a bunch of randomized trial experiments will you have

207
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:07,231
Country a do one thing and then another country that is exactly like country a do a different thing and safe look I have sign

208
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,047
Intific proof that my policy is that you cannot do that

209
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,631
So Courthouse shouldn't build that minimum wage accelerator

210
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,543
I mean you know they got Cornell building the $12 accelerator they got Stanford building the $15 accelerator and we will

211
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
Once and for all

212
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,919
After offer for for his parts of what he thinks

213
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,735
I think that to the extent that

214
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
It's opposed

215
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
This View

216
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,367
That economics has some kind of special Authority

217
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
In the way that

218
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,719
Physics has about the physical well then it's not a good thing

219
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Because

220
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
Economics does not have that

221
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Authority

222
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,607
So so if we think of the

223
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,447
Econ Nobel Prize a sort of sitting over there next to the literature prize

224
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
That's

225
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,799
Good if we think of it as sitting there next to the physics prize

226
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
That's kind of bad that's problematic

227
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
I would say that to you

228
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,455
Economics tell stories about the way we live our lives

229
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,039
50 tells it describes imagined world it's

230
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
A kind of Science Fiction

231
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
A kind of Science Fiction

232
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
I think we should stand it there

233
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
So Hartford

234
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,047
I'm conflicted about that that part of the story we just did

235
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,863
Like I like it I find it interesting

236
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,935
It's like every other episode of Planet Money

237
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,287
You feel me like that is just straight up Planet Money right there that's true and

238
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:30,687
You haven't actually answer the problem of this year's Bible

239
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,247
It's old picture frame beautiful picture frame with no picture

240
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
So we need to be vicious price

241
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
Let's keep going

242
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
Let's do another oblique stretch

243
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
Robert George Rowe

244
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
I can hit the button it says draw card

245
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
Breathe more deeply

246
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,567
I feel good I feel good I feel less worried

247
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:01,407
You have to bear in mind these strategies were originally designed for recording studio

248
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,223
So every now and then you get something that's very music

249
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
Where in a recording studio

250
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,343
Yeah but you don't have a guitar Jacob

251
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,951
Accepting your head but if I pulled out a guitar right now

252
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:21,631
Beijing sanlitun Jacob birthday

253
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:32,639
Go have some contract. Now all right going to do some

254
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,199
All right no more pussyfooting around with this Jacob

255
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
We're doing contract theory

256
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Okay

257
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:43,647
Tell contract is the contract right it's an agreement between two people to company that just occurred

258
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,487
You use your hand and now your hand

259
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,047
I can I can I can wait one hand around here's one hand

260
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Nice

261
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
So

262
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:57,983
You know when you're ready to contract right you want to think about all the potential things that can happen in the future

263
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,031
So you don't get screwed

264
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:04,639
Play right that's what lawyers are for what happens if your factory burned down what happens

265
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:11,039
If you don't deliver the product on time you know you can write all of these details into a contract as long as you want

266
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,439
Display man

267
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,047
So there's always going to be things you can't see coming

268
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,655
Right you can never put every future state of the world

269
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
Into account

270
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
So this is the problem right

271
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
Somebody's going to get screwed

272
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
You going to get a bad outcome

273
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:46,367
So Oliver Hart one of the guys who won the Nobel Prize write his key work is about this he called it incomplete

274
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
They're all these unknown unknowns what do you do about

275
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,535
And his big inside was this he said look sometimes

276
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,351
Certain conditions apply when company should just

277
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,399
Buy the other company outright

278
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,751
That way there's no risk of getting screwed over in the long-term when the unknown unknowns

279
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
I don't think we should talk about the coal mine to you

280
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,271
You got Coal Mine music, it's a perfect example

281
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
Princess if you have

282
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:23,231
An electric plant Burns coal needs to have a long-term contract with call right needs call don't think hey

283
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,303
I'm going to put my electric plant right next to the coal mine

284
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,703
I would travel so far sounds like a good idea sounds like a good idea but if you wrote up this big long contract

285
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:38,591
What if you need a different kind of cool what is the regulation change the Monday night

286
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,431
Put my pants tuck Mexico my home I can screw you

287
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
So under the circumstances

288
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,551
Electric company should just buy the coal mine

289
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,367
Just Own It own it and then you have control

290
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,439
Marca Oliver Hart and you know because it's

291
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:58,559
Science or sort of science or whatever he didn't write a novel about this

292
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,607
We should tell you where to keep paper with steam

293
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Pressman

294
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
Enough to be a rich Finance guy

295
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
They wrote all these equations

296
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,103
I'm actually ask around yesterday so what is the most important equation in the paper

297
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,199
And did everybody agree on what the most important question number 14 cuz like this

298
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,367
A pill to buy is less than or greater than ASA by * as

299
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,927
5 killed somebody is less than or greater than

300
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Fisa by star

301
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Better than a laptop

302
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Got to be true

303
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,351
Got to be true it's in an equation

304
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,703
So this inside had all these different applications in the real world

305
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
How people think about corporate mergers

306
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:45,919
Stop the government what's the should and shouldn't contract out the paper in the 90s arguing that Contracting out prison

307
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
Private company

308
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
Was a bad idea

309
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
Because there were too many

310
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
Unknown unknown

311
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,391
Set up the government to just run prisons themselves

312
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,695
In the theory equation

313
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
And like

314
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:04,095
More generally this paper change the way Economist think about

315
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
Firms with a firm is

316
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:10,239
About the way firms work with each other it was hugely influential

317
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,615
I know that cheating is account is creative

318
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
Who's we did the same thing

319
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Was that oblique

320
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
Enough I mean

321
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,807
I have to say that I think play music actually did

322
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,367
Shake me out of my right it made me

323
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,927
Talk a little more slowly a be a little more like

324
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
Reflective

325
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
I think it's

326
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
That was

327
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Weird

328
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Beautiful

329
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
You know I could

330
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,543
I could listen to contact a with a bit of guitar

331
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
I do not work

332
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
I think this whole thing is working we want to do another one

333
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
Okay you ready

334
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Yeah

335
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
Not building a wall

336
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Making a brick

337
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
Say it again

338
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,183
Not building a wall making a brick

339
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Very oblique

340
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
How many are allowed to go through

341
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:15,775
We just get a few

342
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
The gods of giving

343
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
Okay so here's what it means.

344
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,175
Like don't think of like this whole big

345
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Sing

346
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,991
We have to make think of like

347
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
1

348
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,807
Very one little

349
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,879
Peace or just won something hiding in there

350
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
Kussmaul exactly Zoomin

351
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
I have a suggestion for you

352
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
If you want

353
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
I don't know if you know this but

354
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
Oliver Hart

355
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
Has changed his mind

356
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,447
Wheel of change

357
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
So you might want to look into that

358
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,079
Yes I'm here can you hear me

359
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
I can hear you

360
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,919
Who is this

361
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
Who is this

362
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Oliver

363
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
Oliver who

364
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,343
Oliver Hart Nobel Laureate

365
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,999
So we've been we've been looking at your your work we've been talking to people that chew your work

366
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,327
And try and understand more importantly

367
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
How we can explain it to other people

368
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
And we had one

369
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Big question

370
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
Did you change your mind

371
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,175
Well could you plant Spotify why you ask that

372
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
Be happy to clarify that

373
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,575
Heart that big paper we just talked about that came out in the 80s

374
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,623
About a decade after that

375
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,695
These two prominent, they publish this

376
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
Really deep critique

377
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
Of that paper

378
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Hearts work

379
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
It was pointed out

380
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:49,471
By actually by two other people who won Nobel prizes Eric maskin and

381
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,543
If people were

382
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
100 percent rational

383
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,175
They would be a way of overcoming the the contractual

384
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455
Incompleteness

385
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,759
Eventually in their paper they say Okay heart

386
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,831
You were talking about these unknown unknowns in contacts

387
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Betsy

388
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
Incomplete

389
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
You're assuming

390
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,719
People are perfectly rational cuz that's what Economist do when they do

391
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,887
But in the paper they say if people were perfectly rational they could solve the kind of problem you're talk

392
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
Talking about they could

393
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
Agree in advance that

394
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,263
They would bargain in certain ways when certain things came up

395
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,359
And you wouldn't have to have one company by the other company to solve the problem

396
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,175
And Hart look at this critique and he says

397
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
YouTube

398
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
The right

399
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
The original Theory does not hold up

400
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:40,671
And so to solve this problem that they pointed out to make it all make sense he realizes something

401
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,511
Tell me that for an old-school Economist like Oliver Hart is a huge deal

402
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
He realizes that he has to assume

403
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,375
Fat people entering into contracts are not

404
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
Entirely rational

405
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,495
He starts changing his theory of incomplete contracts to include

406
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Psychology

407
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,055
Ideas about fairness

408
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Magic

409
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,871
I mean sort of

410
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:04,479
Right to be stuffy hippie stuff that does not play much of a role in traditional economic

411
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
Oliver Hart changed his mind

412
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:11,391
Change my mind in the sense that I would have when I started doing this work if people that said

413
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,743
Are there any way you could have do it if you're going to depart from the assumption that

414
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,095
People are rational I would have I would probably lost I live for that copyright

415
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
Something

416
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,983
Why would you have laughed when people said that to initially

417
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
I would have said look

418
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
We're talking about

419
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,127
Maybe large companies that say

420
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
Venture capitalist

421
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,527
What I say you know government the society weather to privatize the prison

422
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,111
I would have thought those were pretty rational hard headed people

423
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
Heart says

424
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,207
A lot of other Economist they still think

425
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:50,815
And any says this warmer fuzzy or theory has has been kind of a tough sell

426
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,935
Yeah a lot of his fellow Economist have given him a really hard time about it and you think

427
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,239
Now that heart has won two Nobel

428
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
If he's moved on

429
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
No

430
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,103
Any slides you know I remember forever

431
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:09,503
Compliments I forget

432
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,391
No seriously like all these stories of specific people who had criticized his work

433
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
You didn't talk at Berkeley one

434
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,232
And it was his friend of his races have

435
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,536
Afula Street in Miami going to name him

436
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,328
But he's a good friend of mine

437
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,632
I like him very much but he said

438
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,472
He actually asked a question he said they should be how does this work

439
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
Compare

440
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
To your

441
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
Odiaone

442
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,872
What what did you take that medicine

443
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
It meant

444
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,016
And I can't use bad language on your program

445
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:48,160
How can I write so it meant you know that the old stuff was good and they say s***

446
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
That's what I took it to mean

447
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:56,096
And I didn't see it you know obviously I thought this is going to be a hard sell this stuff

448
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,424
When the Nobel committee gave all of her heart the prize this

449
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,824
They focused almost entirely on that original version of his theory the one where people are entirely rational

450
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,896
But he's still out there talking about this new version

451
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
He says he's got to do it

452
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
So he had a theory

453
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,760
Someone critical theory

454
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,088
Spot long and hard about he said okay I will incorporate those critiques

455
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
Into a new Theory

456
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
It sounds like science

457
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,464
It does except for one really important

458
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
Fact which is

459
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,864
For the most part nobody's really doing experiments here nobody's going out into the world to like

460
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,984
Actually see if it's true Seattle-Tacoma yeah there's no it's not evidence

461
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
Sprite

462
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:41,152
It's just whatever offer called that imagined world they're just imagining this world and I'm thinking really hard about it engraved

463
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,712
So you can just as easily say Oliver Hart

464
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,296
Told a wonderful story someone critiques some of his characters and plot points

465
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,856
And he told his story

466
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,184
Yeah I mean you can say it's kind of like literature that

467
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
I mean to me

468
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
Decora of the Oliver Hart story is

469
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,072
I think it's super admirable that a famous

470
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,400
Economist was courageous enough to change his mind

471
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,216
You don't have enough of the problem you realize

472
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
You know the

473
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,568
The way you thought it was going to work doesn't work then you

474
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,360
You have to consider alternative

475
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,920
So you're not building a wall you're making a brick

476
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
It's a nice way of putting it with you

477
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:26,720
Wow okay that sounds nice

478
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
XXX very much

479
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
Bye-bye

480

Hartford you're killing it

481
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
So good this is way better than I thought it would
